/* A "rich" source code location, for use when printing diagnostics.
   A rich_location has one or more carets&ranges, where the carets
   are optional.  These are referred to as "ranges" from here.
   Typically the zeroth range has a caret; other ranges sometimes
   have carets.

   The "primary" location of a rich_location is the caret of range 0,
   used for determining the line/column when printing diagnostic
   text, such as:

      some-file.c:3:1: error: ...etc...

   Additional ranges may be added to help the user identify other
   pertinent clauses in a diagnostic.

   Ranges can (optionally) be given labels via class range_label.

   rich_location instances are intended to be allocated on the stack
   when generating diagnostics, and to be short-lived.

   Examples of rich locations
   --------------------------

   Example A
   *********
      int i = "foo";
              ^
   This "rich" location is simply a single range (range 0), with
   caret = start = finish at the given point.

   Example B
   *********
      a = (foo && bar)
          ~~~~~^~~~~~~
   This rich location has a single range (range 0), with the caret
   at the first "&", and the start/finish at the parentheses.
   Compare with example C below.

   Example C
   *********
      a = (foo && bar)
           ~~~ ^~ ~~~
   This rich location has three ranges:
   - Range 0 has its caret and start location at the first "&" and
     end at the second "&.
   - Range 1 has its start and finish at the "f" and "o" of "foo";
     the caret is not flagged for display, but is perhaps at the "f"
     of "foo".
   - Similarly, range 2 has its start and finish at the "b" and "r" of
     "bar"; the caret is not flagged for display, but is perhaps at the
     "b" of "bar".
   Compare with example B above.

   Example D (Fortran frontend)
   ****************************
       x = x + y
           1   2
   This rich location has range 0 at "1", and range 1 at "2".
   Both are flagged for caret display.  Both ranges have start/finish
   equal to their caret point.  The frontend overrides the diagnostic
   context's default caret character for these ranges.

   Example E (range labels)
   ************************
      printf ("arg0: %i  arg1: %s arg2: %i",
                               ^~
                               |
                               const char *
              100, 101, 102);
                   ~~~
                   |
                   int
   This rich location has two ranges:
   - range 0 is at the "%s" with start = caret = "%" and finish at
     the "s".  It has a range_label ("const char *").
   - range 1 has start/finish covering the "101" and is not flagged for
     caret printing.  The caret is at the start of "101", where its
     range_label is printed ("int").

   Fix-it hints
   ------------

   Rich locations can also contain "fix-it hints", giving suggestions
   for the user on how to edit their code to fix a problem.  These
   can be expressed as insertions, replacements, and removals of text.
   The edits by default are relative to the zeroth range within the
   rich_location, but optionally they can be expressed relative to
   other locations (using various overloaded methods of the form
   rich_location::add_fixit_*).

   For example:

   Example F: fix-it hint: insert_before
   *************************************
      ptr = arr[0];
	    ^~~~~~
	    &
   This rich location has a single range (range 0) covering "arr[0]",
   with the caret at the start.  The rich location has a single
   insertion fix-it hint, inserted before range 0, added via
     richloc.add_fixit_insert_before ("&");

   Example G: multiple fix-it hints: insert_before and insert_after
   ****************************************************************
      #define FN(ARG0, ARG1, ARG2) fn(ARG0, ARG1, ARG2)
				      ^~~~  ^~~~  ^~~~
				      (   ) (   ) (   )
   This rich location has three ranges, covering "arg0", "arg1",
   and "arg2", all with caret-printing enabled.
   The rich location has 6 insertion fix-it hints: each arg
   has a pair of insertion fix-it hints, suggesting wrapping
   them with parentheses: one a '(' inserted before,
   the other a ')' inserted after, added via
     richloc.add_fixit_insert_before (LOC, "(");
   and
     richloc.add_fixit_insert_after (LOC, ")");

   Example H: fix-it hint: removal
   *******************************
     struct s {int i};;
		      ^
		      -
   This rich location has a single range at the stray trailing
   semicolon, along with a single removal fix-it hint, covering
   the same range, added via:
     richloc.add_fixit_remove ();

   Example I: fix-it hint: replace
   *******************************
      c = s.colour;
	    ^~~~~~
	    color
   This rich location has a single range (range 0) covering "colour",
   and a single "replace" fix-it hint, covering the same range,
   added via
     richloc.add_fixit_replace ("color");

   Example J: fix-it hint: line insertion
   **************************************

     3 | #include <stddef.h>
     + |+#include <stdio.h>
     4 | int the_next_line;

   This rich location has a single range at line 4 column 1, marked
   with SHOW_LINES_WITHOUT_RANGE (to avoid printing a meaningless caret
   on the "i" of int).  It has a insertion fix-it hint of the string
   "#include <stdio.h>\n".

   Adding a fix-it hint can fail: for example, attempts to insert content
   at the transition between two line maps may fail due to there being no
   location_t value to express the new location.

   Attempts to add a fix-it hint within a macro expansion will fail.

   There is only limited support for newline characters in fix-it hints:
   only hints with newlines which insert an entire new line are permitted,
   inserting at the start of a line, and finishing with a newline
   (with no interior newline characters).  Other attempts to add
   fix-it hints containing newline characters will fail.
   Similarly, attempts to delete or replace a range *affecting* multiple
   lines will fail.

   The rich_location API handles these failures gracefully, so that
   diagnostics can attempt to add fix-it hints without each needing
   extensive checking.

   Fix-it hints within a rich_location are "atomic": if any hints can't
   be applied, none of them will be (tracked by the m_seen_impossible_fixit
   flag), and no fix-its hints will be displayed for that rich_location.
   This implies that diagnostic messages need to be worded in such a way
   that they make sense whether or not the fix-it hints are displayed,
   or that richloc.seen_impossible_fixit_p () should be checked before
   issuing the diagnostics.  */
