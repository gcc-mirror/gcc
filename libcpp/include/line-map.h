/* The typedef "location_t" is a key within the location database,
   identifying a source location or macro expansion, along with range
   information, and (optionally) a pointer for use by gcc.

   This key only has meaning in relation to a line_maps instance.  Within
   gcc there is a single line_maps instance: "line_table", declared in
   gcc/input.h and defined in gcc/input.cc.

   The values of the keys are intended to be internal to libcpp,
   but for ease-of-understanding the implementation, they are currently
   assigned as follows:

  Actual     | Value                         | Meaning
  -----------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
  0x00000000 | UNKNOWN_LOCATION (gcc/input.h)| Unknown/invalid location.
  -----------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
  0x00000001 | BUILTINS_LOCATION             | The location for declarations
             |   (gcc/input.h)               | in "<built-in>"
  -----------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
  0x00000002 | RESERVED_LOCATION_COUNT       | The first location to be
             | (also                         | handed out, and the
             |  ordmap[0]->start_location)   | first line in ordmap 0
  -----------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------
             | ordmap[1]->start_location     | First line in ordmap 1
             | ordmap[1]->start_location+32  | First column in that line
             |   (assuming range_bits == 5)  |
             | ordmap[1]->start_location+64  | 2nd column in that line
             | ordmap[1]->start_location+4096| Second line in ordmap 1
             |   (assuming column_bits == 12)
             |
             |   Subsequent lines are offset by (1 << column_bits),
             |   e.g. 4096 for 12 bits, with a column value of 0 representing
             |   "the whole line".
             |
             |   Within a line, the low "range_bits" (typically 5) are used for
             |   storing short ranges, so that there's an offset of
             |     (1 << range_bits) between individual columns within a line,
             |   typically 32.
             |   The low range_bits store the offset of the end point from the
             |   start point, and the start point is found by masking away
             |   the range bits.
             |
             |   For example:
             |      ordmap[1]->start_location+64    "2nd column in that line"
             |   above means a caret at that location, with a range
             |   starting and finishing at the same place (the range bits
             |   are 0), a range of length 1.
             |
             |   By contrast:
             |      ordmap[1]->start_location+68
             |   has range bits 0x4, meaning a caret with a range starting at
             |   that location, but with endpoint 4 columns further on: a range
             |   of length 5.
             |
             |   Ranges that have caret != start, or have an endpoint too
             |   far away to fit in range_bits are instead stored as ad-hoc
             |   locations.  Hence for range_bits == 5 we can compactly store
             |   tokens of length <= 32 without needing to use the ad-hoc
             |   table.
             |
             |   This packing scheme means we effectively have
             |     (column_bits - range_bits)
             |   of bits for the columns, typically (12 - 5) = 7, for 128
             |   columns; longer line widths are accomodated by starting a
             |   new ordmap with a higher column_bits.

   Examples of location encoding.

   Packed ranges
   =============

   Consider encoding the location of a token "foo", seen underlined here
   on line 523, within an ordinary line_map that starts at line 500:

                 11111111112
        12345678901234567890
     522
     523   return foo + bar;
                  ^~~
     524

   The location's caret and start are both at line 523, column 11; the
   location's finish is on the same line, at column 13 (an offset of 2
   columns, for length 3).

   Line 523 is offset 23 from the starting line of the ordinary line_map.

   caret == start, and the offset of the finish fits within 5 bits, so
   this can be stored as a packed range.

   This is encoded as:
      ordmap->start
         + (line_offset << ordmap->m_column_and_range_bits)
         + (column << ordmap->m_range_bits)
         + (range_offset);
   i.e. (for line offset 23, column 11, range offset 2):
      ordmap->start
         + (23 << 12)
         + (11 << 5)
         + 2;
   i.e.:
      ordmap->start + 0x17162
   assuming that the line_map uses the default of 7 bits for columns and
   5 bits for packed range (giving 12 bits for m_column_and_range_bits).


   "Pure" locations
   ================

   These are a special case of the above, where
      caret == start == finish
   They are stored as packed ranges with offset == 0.
   For example, the location of the "f" of "foo" could be stored
   as above, but with range offset 0, giving:
      ordmap->start
         + (23 << 12)
         + (11 << 5)
         + 0;
   i.e.:
      ordmap->start + 0x17160


   Unoptimized ranges
   ==================

   Consider encoding the location of the binary expression
   below:

                 11111111112
        12345678901234567890
     522
     523   return foo + bar;
                  ~~~~^~~~~
     524

   The location's caret is at the "+", line 523 column 15, but starts
   earlier, at the "f" of "foo" at column 11.  The finish is at the "r"
   of "bar" at column 19.

   This can't be stored as a packed range since start != caret.
   Hence it is stored as an ad-hoc location e.g. 0x80000003.

   Stripping off the top bit gives us an index into the ad-hoc
   lookaside table:

     line_table->location_adhoc_data_map.data[0x3]

   from which the caret, start and finish can be looked up,
   encoded as "pure" locations:

     start  == ordmap->start + (23 << 12) + (11 << 5)
            == ordmap->start + 0x17160  (as above; the "f" of "foo")

     caret  == ordmap->start + (23 << 12) + (15 << 5)
            == ordmap->start + 0x171e0

     finish == ordmap->start + (23 << 12) + (19 << 5)
            == ordmap->start + 0x17260

   There are two kinds of maps. Ordinary maps and macro expansion
   maps, a.k.a macro maps.

   A macro map encodes source locations of tokens that are part of a
   macro replacement-list, at a macro expansion point. E.g, in:

            #define PLUS(A,B) A + B

   No macro map is going to be created there, because we are not at a
   macro expansion point. We are at a macro /definition/ point. So the
   locations of the tokens of the macro replacement-list (i.e, A + B)
   will be locations in an ordinary map, not a macro map.

   On the other hand, if we later do:

        int a = PLUS (1,2);

   The invocation of PLUS here is a macro expansion. So we are at a
   macro expansion point. The preprocessor expands PLUS (1,2) and
   replaces it with the tokens of its replacement-list: 1 + 2. A macro
   map is going to be created to hold (or rather to map, haha ...) the
   locations of the tokens 1, + and 2. The macro map also records the
   location of the expansion point of PLUS. That location is mapped in
   the map that is active right before the location of the invocation
   of PLUS.  */

     Imagine this:

     expanded into its expansion-list.  The expansion-list is the

     the tokens:

        A, +, B

     and the expansion-list is made of the tokens:

     Let's consider the case of token "+".  Its y1 [yI for I == 1] is
     its spelling location in #1.

     y0 (thus for token "1") is the spelling location of A in #1.

     And y2 (of token "2") is the spelling location of B in #1.

     When the token is /not/ an argument for a macro, xI is the same
     location as yI.  Otherwise, xI is the location of the token
     outside this macro expansion.  If this macro was expanded from
     another macro expansion, xI is a virtual location representing
     the token in that macro expansion; otherwise, it is the spelling
     location of the token.

     Note that a virtual location is a location returned by
     linemap_add_macro_token.  It encodes the relevant locations (x,y
     pairs) of that token across the macro expansions from which it
     (the token) might come from.

     In the example above x1 (for token "+") is going to be the same
     as y1.  x0 is the spelling location for the argument token "1",
     and x2 is the spelling location for the argument token "2".  */

/* A "rich" source code location, for use when printing diagnostics.
   A rich_location has one or more carets&ranges, where the carets
   are optional.  These are referred to as "ranges" from here.
   Typically the zeroth range has a caret; other ranges sometimes
   have carets.

   The "primary" location of a rich_location is the caret of range 0,
   used for determining the line/column when printing diagnostic
   text, such as:

      some-file.c:3:1: error: ...etc...

   Additional ranges may be added to help the user identify other
   pertinent clauses in a diagnostic.

   Ranges can (optionally) be given labels via class range_label.

   rich_location instances are intended to be allocated on the stack
   when generating diagnostics, and to be short-lived.

   Examples of rich locations
   --------------------------

   Example A
   *********
      int i = "foo";
              ^
   This "rich" location is simply a single range (range 0), with
   caret = start = finish at the given point.

   Example B
   *********
      a = (foo && bar)
          ~~~~~^~~~~~~
   This rich location has a single range (range 0), with the caret
   at the first "&", and the start/finish at the parentheses.
   Compare with example C below.

   Example C
   *********
      a = (foo && bar)
           ~~~ ^~ ~~~
   This rich location has three ranges:
   - Range 0 has its caret and start location at the first "&" and
     end at the second "&.
   - Range 1 has its start and finish at the "f" and "o" of "foo";
     the caret is not flagged for display, but is perhaps at the "f"
     of "foo".
   - Similarly, range 2 has its start and finish at the "b" and "r" of
     "bar"; the caret is not flagged for display, but is perhaps at the
     "b" of "bar".
   Compare with example B above.

   Example D (Fortran frontend)
   ****************************
       x = x + y
           1   2
   This rich location has range 0 at "1", and range 1 at "2".
   Both are flagged for caret display.  Both ranges have start/finish
   equal to their caret point.  The frontend overrides the diagnostic
   context's default caret character for these ranges.

   Example E (range labels)
   ************************
      printf ("arg0: %i  arg1: %s arg2: %i",
                               ^~
                               |
                               const char *
              100, 101, 102);
                   ~~~
                   |
                   int
   This rich location has two ranges:
   - range 0 is at the "%s" with start = caret = "%" and finish at
     the "s".  It has a range_label ("const char *").
   - range 1 has start/finish covering the "101" and is not flagged for
     caret printing.  The caret is at the start of "101", where its
     range_label is printed ("int").

   Fix-it hints
   ------------

   Rich locations can also contain "fix-it hints", giving suggestions
   for the user on how to edit their code to fix a problem.  These
   can be expressed as insertions, replacements, and removals of text.
   The edits by default are relative to the zeroth range within the
   rich_location, but optionally they can be expressed relative to
   other locations (using various overloaded methods of the form
   rich_location::add_fixit_*).

   For example:

   Example F: fix-it hint: insert_before
   *************************************
      ptr = arr[0];
	    ^~~~~~
	    &
   This rich location has a single range (range 0) covering "arr[0]",
   with the caret at the start.  The rich location has a single
   insertion fix-it hint, inserted before range 0, added via
     richloc.add_fixit_insert_before ("&");

   Example G: multiple fix-it hints: insert_before and insert_after
   ****************************************************************
      #define FN(ARG0, ARG1, ARG2) fn(ARG0, ARG1, ARG2)
				      ^~~~  ^~~~  ^~~~
				      (   ) (   ) (   )
   This rich location has three ranges, covering "arg0", "arg1",
   and "arg2", all with caret-printing enabled.
   The rich location has 6 insertion fix-it hints: each arg
   has a pair of insertion fix-it hints, suggesting wrapping
   them with parentheses: one a '(' inserted before,
   the other a ')' inserted after, added via
     richloc.add_fixit_insert_before (LOC, "(");
   and
     richloc.add_fixit_insert_after (LOC, ")");

   Example H: fix-it hint: removal
   *******************************
     struct s {int i};;
		      ^
		      -
   This rich location has a single range at the stray trailing
   semicolon, along with a single removal fix-it hint, covering
   the same range, added via:
     richloc.add_fixit_remove ();

   Example I: fix-it hint: replace
   *******************************
      c = s.colour;
	    ^~~~~~
	    color
   This rich location has a single range (range 0) covering "colour",
   and a single "replace" fix-it hint, covering the same range,
   added via
     richloc.add_fixit_replace ("color");

   Example J: fix-it hint: line insertion
   **************************************

     3 | #include <stddef.h>
     + |+#include <stdio.h>
     4 | int the_next_line;

   This rich location has a single range at line 4 column 1, marked
   with SHOW_LINES_WITHOUT_RANGE (to avoid printing a meaningless caret
   on the "i" of int).  It has a insertion fix-it hint of the string
   "#include <stdio.h>\n".

   Adding a fix-it hint can fail: for example, attempts to insert content
   at the transition between two line maps may fail due to there being no
   location_t value to express the new location.

   Attempts to add a fix-it hint within a macro expansion will fail.

   There is only limited support for newline characters in fix-it hints:
   only hints with newlines which insert an entire new line are permitted,
   inserting at the start of a line, and finishing with a newline
   (with no interior newline characters).  Other attempts to add
   fix-it hints containing newline characters will fail.
   Similarly, attempts to delete or replace a range *affecting* multiple
   lines will fail.

   The rich_location API handles these failures gracefully, so that
   diagnostics can attempt to add fix-it hints without each needing
   extensive checking.

   Fix-it hints within a rich_location are "atomic": if any hints can't
   be applied, none of them will be (tracked by the m_seen_impossible_fixit
   flag), and no fix-its hints will be displayed for that rich_location.
   This implies that diagnostic messages need to be worded in such a way
   that they make sense whether or not the fix-it hints are displayed,
   or that richloc.seen_impossible_fixit_p () should be checked before
   issuing the diagnostics.  */

   been spelled in the source.   This can follow through all the macro
   expansions that led to the token.

   * If LRK is set to LRK_MACRO_DEFINITION_LOCATION
   --------------------------------------

   The virtual location is resolved to the locus of the token in the
   context of the macro definition.

   If LOC is the locus of a token that is an argument of a
   function-like macro [replacing a parameter in the replacement list
   of the macro] the virtual location is resolved to the locus of the
   parameter that is replaced, in the context of the definition of the
   macro.

   If LOC is the locus of a token that is not an argument of a
   function-like macro, then the function behaves as if LRK was set to
   LRK_SPELLING_LOCATION.

   If LOC_MAP is not NULL, *LOC_MAP is set to the map encoding the
   returned location.  Note that if the returned location wasn't originally
   encoded by a map, the *MAP is set to NULL.  This can happen if LOC
   resolves to a location reserved for the client code, like
   UNKNOWN_LOCATION or BUILTINS_LOCATION in GCC.  */

   location inside a macro expansion M', then this function returns
   the point where M' was expanded.  LOC_MAP is an output parameter.

   is not reserved and is not in a system header is reached.  In other
   words, this unwinds the reserved location until a location that is
   in real source code is reached.

   Otherwise, if the spelling location for LOC is not reserved or if
   LOC doesn't come from the expansion of a macro, the function
   returns LOC as is and *MAP is not touched.
