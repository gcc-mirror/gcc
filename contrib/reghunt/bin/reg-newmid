# The build failed for and identifier in the range bwetween LOW and HIGH.
# Find a new patch id to try within that range.
#
# It's meant to be easy to modify the heuristics used to select the
# next patch to try by adding to or rearranging the patches listed in
# MIDLIST.  Known failures are recorded in ${REG_FAILLIST}.
#
# A nifty improvement would be to record known ranges of failure as
# ranges, and then pick revisions just before and just after the range.
