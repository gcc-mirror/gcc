# Date:    2005/09/08
#
# For each of a list of patches, invoke separate tools to update
# sources, do a build, and run one or more tests. 
#
# Define these in a file whose name is the argument to this script:
#   REG_IDLIST: List of patch identifiers.
#   REG_UPDATE: Pathname of script to update the source tree.
#   REG_BUILD:  Pathname of script to build enough of the product to run
#               the test.
#   REG_TEST:   Pathname of script to run one or more tests.
# Optional:
#   VERBOSITY:  Default is 0, to print only errors and final message.
#   DATE_IN_MSG If set to anything but 0, include the time and date in
#               messages
#   REG_STOP    Pathname of a file whose existence says to quit; default
#               is STOP in the current directory.
