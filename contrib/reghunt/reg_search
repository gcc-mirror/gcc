# File:    reg_search
# Author:  Janis Johnson <janis187@us.ibm.com>
# Date:    2002/12/15
#
# Search for a small time interval within a range of dates in which
# results for a test changed, using a binary search.  The functionality
# for getting sources, building the component to test, and running the
# test are in other scripts that are run from here.  Before the search
# begins, we verify that we get the expected behavior for the first and
# last dates.
#
# Define these in a file whose name is the argument to this script:
#   LOW_DATE:   Date string recognized by the date command (local time).
#   HIGH_DATE:  Date string recognized by the date command (local time).
#   REG_UPDATE: Pathname of script to update your source tree; returns
#               zero for success, nonzero for failure.
#   REG_BUILD:  Pathname of script to build enough of the product to run
#               the test; returns zero for success, nonzero for failure.
#   REG_TEST:   Pathname of script to run the test; returns 1 if we
#               should search later dates, 0 if we should search earlier
#               dates.
# Optional:
#   DELTA:      Search to an interval within this many seconds; default
#               is one hour (although 300 works well).
#   REG_FINISH  Pathname of script to call at the end with the two final
#               dates as arguments.
#   SKIP_LOW    If 1, skip verifying the low date of the range;
#               define this only if you're restarting and have already
#               tested the low date.
#   SKIP_HIGH   If 1, skip verifying the high date of the range;
#               define this only if you're restarting and have already
#               tested the high date.
#   FIRST_MID   Use this as the first midpoint, to avoid a midpoint that
#               is known not to build.
#   HAS_CHANGES Pathname of script to report whether the current date has
#               no differences from one of the ends of the current range
#               to skip unnecessary build and testing; default is "true".
#   VERBOSITY   Default is 0, to print only errors and final message.
#   DATE_IN_MSG If set to anything but 0, include the time and date in
#               messages.
