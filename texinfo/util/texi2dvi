# In the interest of general portability, some common bourne shell
# constructs were avoided because they weren't guaranteed to be available
# in some earlier implementations.  I've tried to make this program as
# portable as possible.  Welcome to unix, where the lowest common
# denominator is rapidly diminishing.
#
# Among the more interesting lossages I noticed among Bourne shells:
#     * No shell functions.
#     * No `unset' builtin.
#     * `shift' cannot take a numeric argument, and signals an error if
#       there are no arguments to shift.
#
# Code:

# Name by which this script was invoked.
progname=`echo "$0" | sed -e 's/[^\/]*\///g'`

# This string is expanded by rcs automatically when this file is checked out.
rcs_revision='$Revision: 1.1.1.3 $'
version=`set - $rcs_revision; echo $2`

# To prevent hairy quoting and escaping later.

eq="'"

usage="Usage: $0 [OPTION]... FILE...
Run a Texinfo document through TeX.

Options:
-b, --batch          No interaction (\nonstopmode in TeX).
-c, --clean          Remove all auxiliary files.
-D, --debug          Turn on shell debugging ($bq${bq}set -x$eq$eq).
-t, --texinfo CMD    Insert CMD after @setfilename before running TeX.
--verbose            Report on what is done.
-h, --help           Display this help and exit.
-v, --version        Display version information and exit.

The values of the TEX, TEXINDEX, and MAKEINFO environment variables are
used to run those commands, if they are set.

Email bug reports to bug-texinfo@gnu.org."
