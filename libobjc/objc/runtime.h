  This file declares the "modern" GNU Objective-C Runtime API.
  Include this file to use it.

  This API is replacing the "traditional" GNU Objective-C Runtime API
  (declared in objc/objc-api.h) which is the one supported by older
  versions of the GNU Objective-C Runtime.  The "modern" API is very
  similar to the API used by the modern Apple/NeXT runtime.

  Because the two APIs have some conflicting definitions (in
  particular, Method and Category are defined differently) you should
  include either objc/objc-api.h (to use the traditional GNU
  Objective-C Runtime API) or objc/runtime.h (to use the modern GNU
  Objective-C Runtime API), but not both.
