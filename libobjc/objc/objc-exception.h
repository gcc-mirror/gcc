/* 'objc_exception_throw' throws the exception 'exception', which is
   an exception object.

   Calls to 'objc_exception_throw' are automatically generated by the
   compiler: an Objective-C "@throw exception;" statement gets
   compiled into the equivalent of "objc_exception_throw
   (exception);".

   'objc_exception_throw' searches for a @catch() that can catch the
   exception.  By default, @catch (MyClass object) will catch all
   exception objects that are of class MyClass or of a subclass of
   MyClass; if the exception object is 'nil', then the exception can
   only be caught with a catch-all exception handler where no
   exception class is specified (such as @catch(id object)).  This
   behaviour can be customized by setting an 'objc_exception_matcher'
   function (using objc_set_exception_matcher(), see below); if one is
   set, it is used instead of the default one.

   If the exception is uncaught (there is no @catch() to catch it),
   the program aborts.  It is possible to customize this behaviour by
   setting an 'objc_uncaught_exception_handler' function (using
   objc_set_uncaught_exception_handler(), see below); if one is set,
   it is executed before abort() is called.  An uncaught exception
   handler is expected to never return.  */
objc_EXPORT void objc_exception_throw (id exception);

/* Compatibility note: the Apple/NeXT runtime seems to also have
   objc_exception_rethrow(), objc_begin_catch() and objc_end_catch().
   Currently the GNU runtime does not use them.  */

/* The following functions allow customizing to a certain extent the
   exception handling.  They are not thread safe and should be called
   during the program initialization before threads are started.  They
   are mostly reserved for "Foundation" libraries; in the case of
   GNUstep, GNUstep Base may be using these functions to improve the
   standard exception handling.  You probably shouldn't use these
   functions unless you are writing your own Foundation library.  */

/* Compatibility note: objc_set_exception_preprocessor() (available on
   the Apple/NeXT runtime) is not available on the GNU runtime.  */

/* An 'objc_exception_matcher' function is used to match an exception
   to a @catch clause.  'catch_class' is the class of objects caught
   by the @catch clause (for example, in "@catch (Object *o)", the
   catch_class is Object).  It should return 1 if the exception should
   be caught by a @catch with a catch_class argument, and 0 if
   not.  */
