/* Coverage information is held in two files.  A basic block graph
   file, which is generated by the compiler, and a counter file, which
   is generated by the program under test.  Both files use a similar
   structure.  We do not attempt to make these files backwards
   compatible with previous versions, as you only need coverage
   information when developing a program.  We do hold version
   information, so that mismatches can be detected, and we use a
   format that allows tools to skip information they do not understand
   or are not interested in.

   Numbers are recorded in big endian unsigned binary form.  Either in
   32 or 64 bits.  Strings are stored with a length count and NUL
   terminator, and 0 to 3 bytes of zero padding up to the next 4 byte
   boundary.  Zero length and NULL strings are simply stored as a
   length of zero (they have no trailing NUL or padding).

   	int32:  byte3 byte2 byte1 byte0
	int64:  byte7 byte6 byte5 byte4 byte3 byte2 byte1 byte0
	string: int32:0 | int32:length char* char:0 padding
	padding: | char:0 | char:0 char:0 | char:0 char:0 char:0
	item: int32 | int64 | string

   The basic format of the files is

   	file : int32:magic int32:version record*

   The magic ident is different for the bbg and the counter files.
   The version is the same for both files and is derived from gcc's
   version number.  Although the ident and version are formally 32 bit
   numbers, they are derived from 4 character ASCII strings.  The
   version number consists of the single character major version
   number, a two character minor version number (leading zero for
   versions less than 10), and a single character indicating the
   status of the release.  That will be 'e' experimental, 'p'
   prerelease and 'r' for release.  Because, by good fortune, these are
   in alphabetical order, string collating can be used to compare
   version strings, and because numbers are stored big endian, numeric
   comparison can be used when it is read as a 32 bit value.  Be aware
   that the 'e' designation will (naturally) be unstable and might be
   incompatible with itself.  For gcc 3.4 experimental, it would be
   '304e' (0x33303465).  When the major version reaches 10, the letters
   A-Z will be used.  Assuming minor increments releases every 6
   months, we have to make a major increment every 50 years.  Assuming
   major increments releases every 5 years, we're ok for the next 155
   years -- good enough for me.

   A record has a tag, length and variable amount of data.

   	record: header data
	header: int32:tag int32:length
	data: item*

   Records are not nested, but there is a record hierarchy.  Tag
   numbers reflect this hierarchy.  Tags are unique across bbg and da
   files.  Some record types have a varying amount of data.  The LENGTH
   is usually used to determine how much data.  The tag value is split
   into 4 8-bit fields, one for each of four possible levels.  The
   most significant is allocated first.  Unused levels are zero.
   Active levels are odd-valued, so that the LSB of the level is one.
   A sub-level incorporates the values of its superlevels.  This
   formatting allows you to determine the tag heirarchy, without
   understanding the tags themselves, and is similar to the standard
   section numbering used in technical documents.  Level values
   [1..3f] are used for common tags, values [41..9f] for the graph
   file and [a1..ff] for the counter file.

   The basic block graph file contains the following records
   	bbg:  function-graph*
	function-graph: announce_function basic_blocks {arcs | lines}*
	announce_function: header string:name int32:checksum
		string:source int32:lineno
	basic_block: header int32:flags*
	arcs: header int32:block_no arc*
	arc:  int32:dest_block int32:flags
        lines: header int32:block_no line*
               int32:0 string:NULL
	line:  int32:line_no | int32:0 string:filename

   The BASIC_BLOCK record holds per-bb flags.  The number of blocks
   can be inferred from its data length.  There is one ARCS record per
   basic block.  The number of arcs from a bb is implicit from the
   data length.  It enumerates the destination bb and per-arc flags.
   There is one LINES record per basic block, it enumerates the source
   lines which belong to that basic block.  Source file names are
   introduced by a line number of 0, following lines are from the new
   source file.  The initial source file for the function is NULL, but
   the current source file should be remembered from one LINES record
   to the next.  The end of a block is indicated by an empty filename
   - this does not reset the current source file.  Note there is no
   ordering of the ARCS and LINES records: they may be in any order,
   interleaved in any manner.  The current filename follows the order
   the LINES records are stored in the file, *not* the ordering of the
   blocks they are for.

   The data file contains the following records.
        da:   {function-data* summary:object summary:program*}*
        function-data:	announce_function arc_counts
	announce_function: header string:name int32:checksum
	arc_counts: header int64:count*
	summary: in32:checksum int32:runs int32:arcs int64:sum int64:max \
		int64:sum_max

   The ANNOUNCE_FUNCTION record is the same as that in the BBG file,
   but without the source location.
   The ARC_COUNTS gives the counter values for those arcs that are
   instrumented.  The SUMMARY records give information about the whole
   object file and about the whole program.  The checksum is used for
   whole program summaries, and disambiguates different programs which
   include the same instrumented object file.  There may be several
   program summaries, each with a unique checksum.  The object
   summary's checkum is zero.  Note that the da file might contain
   information from several runs concatenated, or the data might be
   merged.

   This file is included by both the compiler, gcov tools and the
   runtime support library libgcov. IN_LIBGCOV and IN_GCOV are used to
   distinguish which case is which.  If IN_LIBGCOV is non-zero,
   libgcov is being built. If IN_GCOV is non-zero, the gcov tools are
   being built. Otherwise the compiler is being built. IN_GCOV may be
   positive or negative. If positive, we are compiling a tool that
   requires additional functions (see the code for knowledge of what
   those functions are).  */
