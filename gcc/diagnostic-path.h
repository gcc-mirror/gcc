/* A diagnostic_path is an optional additional piece of metadata associated
   with a diagnostic (via its rich_location).

   It describes a sequence of events predicted by the compiler that
   lead to the problem occurring, with their locations in the user's source,
   and text descriptions.

   For example, the following error has a 3-event path:

     test.c: In function 'demo':
     test.c:29:5: error: passing NULL as argument 1 to 'PyList_Append' which
       requires a non-NULL parameter
        29 |     PyList_Append(list, item);
           |     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       'demo': events 1-3
        25 |   list = PyList_New(0);
           |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
           |          |
           |          (1) when 'PyList_New' fails, returning NULL
        26 |
        27 |   for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
           |   ~~~
           |   |
           |   (2) when 'i < count'
        28 |     item = PyLong_FromLong(random());
        29 |     PyList_Append(list, item);
           |     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           |     |
           |     (3) when calling 'PyList_Append', passing NULL from (1) as argument 1

    The diagnostic-printing code has consolidated the path into a single
    run of events, since all the events are near each other and within the same
    function; more complicated examples (such as interprocedural paths)
    might be printed as multiple runs of events.  */
