/* Generate basic block profile instrumentation and auxiliary files.
   Profile generation is optimized, so that not all arcs in the basic
   block graph need instrumenting. First, the BB graph is closed with
   one entry (function start), and one exit (function exit).  Any
   ABNORMAL_EDGE cannot be instrumented (because there is no control
   path to place the code). We close the graph by inserting fake
   EDGE_FAKE edges to the EXIT_BLOCK, from the sources of abnormal
   edges that do not go to the exit_block. We ignore such abnormal
   edges.  Naturally these fake edges are never directly traversed,
   and so *cannot* be directly instrumented.  Some other graph
   massaging is done. To optimize the instrumentation we generate the
   BB minimal span tree, only edges that are not on the span tree
   (plus the entry point) need instrumenting. From that information
   all other edge counts can be deduced.  By construction all fake
   edges must be on the spanning tree. We also attempt to place
   EDGE_CRITICAL edges on the spanning tree.

   The auxiliary files generated are <dumpbase>.gcno (at compile time)
   and <dumpbase>.gcda (at run time).  The format is
   described in full in gcov-io.h.  */

/* ??? Register allocation should use basic block execution counts to
   give preference to the most commonly executed blocks.  */

/* ??? Should calculate branch probabilities before instrumenting code, since
   then we can use arc counts to help decide which arcs to instrument.  */
