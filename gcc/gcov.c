   There are a bajillion algorithms that do this.  Boost's function is named

   "Enumerating Circuits and Loops in Graphs with Self-Arcs and Multiple-Arcs"
   (url at <http://complexity.massey.ac.nz/cstn/013/cstn-013.pdf>).

   The basic algorithm is simple: effectively, we're finding all simple paths
   in a subgraph (that shrinks every iteration).  Duplicates are filtered by
   "blocking" a path when a node is added to the path (this also prevents non-
   simple paths)--the node is unblocked only when it participates in a cycle.
