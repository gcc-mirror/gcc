/* An implementation of diagnostic_path which has a trivial ctor
   and lazily creates another diagnostic_path the first time the path
   is queried, deferring to this inner path for all queries.

   Use this to avoid expensive path creation logic when creating
   rich_location instances, so that expense can be deferred until the path
   is actually used by a diagnostic, and thus avoided for warnings that
   are disabled.  */
