Objects
=======

.. class:: gccjit::object

Almost every entity in the API (with the exception of
:class:`gccjit::context` and :c:type:`gcc_jit_result *`) is a
"contextual" object, a :class:`gccjit::object`.

A JIT object:

  * is associated with a :class:`gccjit::context`.

  * is automatically cleaned up for you when its context is released so
    you don't need to manually track and cleanup all objects, just the
    contexts.

The C++ class hierarchy within the ``gccjit`` namespace looks like this::

  +- object
      +- location
      +- type
         +- struct
      +- field
      +- function
      +- block
      +- rvalue
          +- lvalue
             +- param
      +- case_

The :class:`gccjit::object` base class has the following operations:

.. function:: gccjit::context gccjit::object::get_context () const

  Which context is the obj within?

.. function:: std::string gccjit::object::get_debug_string () const

  Generate a human-readable description for the given object.

  For example,

  .. code-block:: c++

     printf ("obj: %s\n", obj.get_debug_string ().c_str ());

  might give this text on stdout:

  .. code-block:: bash

     obj: 4.0 * (float)i
