libgccjit
=========

This document describes `libgccjit <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/JIT>`_, an API
for embedding GCC inside programs and libraries.

There are actually two APIs for the library:

* a pure C API: ``libgccjit.h``

* a C++ wrapper API: ``libgccjit++.h``.  This is a collection of "thin"
  wrapper classes around the C API, to save typing.
