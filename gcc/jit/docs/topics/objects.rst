Objects
=======

.. type:: gcc_jit_object

Almost every entity in the API (with the exception of
:c:type:`gcc_jit_context *` and :c:type:`gcc_jit_result *`) is a
"contextual" object, a :c:type:`gcc_jit_object *`

A JIT object:

  * is associated with a :c:type:`gcc_jit_context *`.

  * is automatically cleaned up for you when its context is released so
    you don't need to manually track and cleanup all objects, just the
    contexts.

Although the API is C-based, there is a form of class hierarchy, which
looks like this::

  +- gcc_jit_object
      +- gcc_jit_location
      +- gcc_jit_type
         +- gcc_jit_struct
      +- gcc_jit_field
      +- gcc_jit_function
      +- gcc_jit_block
      +- gcc_jit_rvalue
          +- gcc_jit_lvalue
             +- gcc_jit_param
      +- gcc_jit_case

There are casting methods for upcasting from subclasses to parent classes.
For example, :c:func:`gcc_jit_type_as_object`:

.. code-block:: c

   gcc_jit_object *obj = gcc_jit_type_as_object (int_type);

The object "base class" has the following operations:

.. function:: gcc_jit_context *gcc_jit_object_get_context (gcc_jit_object *obj)

  Which context is "obj" within?


.. function:: const char *gcc_jit_object_get_debug_string (gcc_jit_object *obj)

  Generate a human-readable description for the given object.

  For example,

  .. code-block:: c

     printf ("obj: %s\n", gcc_jit_object_get_debug_string (obj));

  might give this text on stdout:

  .. code-block:: bash

     obj: 4.0 * (float)i

  .. note::

     If you call this on an object, the `const char *` buffer is allocated
     and generated on the first call for that object, and the buffer will
     have the same lifetime as the object  i.e. it will exist until the
     object's context is released.
