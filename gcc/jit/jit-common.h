/* This comment is included by the docs.

   In order to allow jit objects to be usable outside of a compile
   whilst working with the existing structure of GCC's code the
   C API is implemented in terms of a gcc::jit::recording::context,
   which records the calls made to it.

   When a gcc_jit_context is compiled, the recording context creates a
   playback context.  The playback context invokes the bulk of the GCC
   code, and within the "frontend" parsing hook, plays back the recorded
   API calls, creating GCC tree objects.

   So there are two parallel families of classes: those relating to
   recording, and those relating to playback:

   * Visibility: recording objects are exposed back to client code,
     whereas playback objects are internal to the library.

   * Lifetime: recording objects have a lifetime equal to that of the
     recording context that created them, whereas playback objects only
     exist within the frontend hook.

   * Memory allocation: recording objects are allocated by the recording
     context, and automatically freed by it when the context is released,
     whereas playback objects are allocated within the GC heap, and
     garbage-collected; they can own GC-references.

   * Integration with rest of GCC: recording objects are unrelated to the
     rest of GCC, whereas playback objects are wrappers around "tree"
     instances.  Hence you can't ask a recording rvalue or lvalue what its
     type is, whereas you can for a playback rvalue of lvalue (since it
     can work with the underlying GCC tree nodes).

   * Instancing: There can be multiple recording contexts "alive" at once
     (albeit it only one compiling at once), whereas there can only be one
     playback context alive at one time (since it interacts with the GC).

   Ultimately if GCC could support multiple GC heaps and contexts, and
   finer-grained initialization, then this recording vs playback
   distinction could be eliminated.

   During a playback, we associate objects from the recording with
   their counterparts during this playback.  For simplicity, we store this
   within the recording objects, as ``void *m_playback_obj``, casting it to
   the appropriate playback object subclass.  For these casts to make
   sense, the two class hierarchies need to have the same structure.

   Note that the playback objects that ``m_playback_obj`` points to are
   GC-allocated, but the recording objects don't own references:
   these associations only exist within a part of the code where
   the GC doesn't collect, and are set back to NULL before the GC can
   run.
