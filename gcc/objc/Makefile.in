#  The Makefile built from this file lives in the objc language subdirectory.
#  Its purpose is to provide support for:
#
#  1. recursion where necessary, and only then (building .o's), and
#  2. building and debugging cc1objc from the language subdirectory.
#
#  The parent Makefile handles all other chores, with help from the language
#  Makefile fragment.
#
#  The targets for external use are `all' and `mostlyclean'.
