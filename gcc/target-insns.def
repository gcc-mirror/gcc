/* This file has one entry for each public pattern name that the target
   can provide.  It is only used if no distinction between operand modes
   is necessary.  If separate patterns are needed for different modes
   (so as to distinguish addition of QImode values from addition of
   HImode values, for example) then an optab should be used instead.

   Each entry has the form:

     DEF_TARGET_INSN (name, prototype)

   where NAME is the name of the pattern and PROTOTYPE is its C prototype.
   The prototype should use parameter names of the form "x0", "x1", etc.
   Patterns that take no operands should have a prototype "(void)".

   Instructions should be documented in md.texi rather than here.  */
