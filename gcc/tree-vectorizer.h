/* In general, we can divide the vector statements in a vectorized loop
   into related groups ("rgroups") and say that for each rgroup there is
   some nS such that the rgroup operates on nS values from one scalar
   iteration followed by nS values from the next.  That is, if VF is the
   vectorization factor of the loop, the rgroup operates on a sequence:

     (1,1) (1,2) ... (1,nS) (2,1) ... (2,nS) ... (VF,1) ... (VF,nS)

   where (i,j) represents a scalar value with index j in a scalar
   iteration with index i.

   [ We use the term "rgroup" to emphasise that this grouping isn't
     necessarily the same as the grouping of statements used elsewhere.
     For example, if we implement a group of scalar loads using gather
     loads, we'll use a separate gather load for each scalar load, and
     thus each gather load will belong to its own rgroup. ]

   In general this sequence will occupy nV vectors concatenated
   together.  If these vectors have nL lanes each, the total number
   of scalar values N is given by:

       N = nS * VF = nV * nL

   None of nS, VF, nV and nL are required to be a power of 2.  nS and nV
   are compile-time constants but VF and nL can be variable (if the target
   supports variable-length vectors).

   In classical vectorization, each iteration of the vector loop would
   handle exactly VF iterations of the original scalar loop.  However,
   in vector loops that are able to operate on partial vectors, a
   particular iteration of the vector loop might handle fewer than VF
   iterations of the scalar loop.  The vector lanes that correspond to
   iterations of the scalar loop are said to be "active" and the other
   lanes are said to be "inactive".

   In such vector loops, many rgroups need to be controlled to ensure
   that they have no effect for the inactive lanes.  Conceptually, each
   such rgroup needs a sequence of booleans in the same order as above,
   but with each (i,j) replaced by a boolean that indicates whether
   iteration i is active.  This sequence occupies nV vector controls
   that again have nL lanes each.  Thus the control sequence as a whole
   consists of VF independent booleans that are each repeated nS times.

   Taking mask-based approach as a partially-populated vectors example.
   We make the simplifying assumption that if a sequence of nV masks is
   suitable for one (nS,nL) pair, we can reuse it for (nS/2,nL/2) by
   VIEW_CONVERTing it.  This holds for all current targets that support
   fully-masked loops.  For example, suppose the scalar loop is:

     float *f;
     double *d;
     for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
       {
	 f[i * 2 + 0] += 1.0f;
	 f[i * 2 + 1] += 2.0f;
	 d[i] += 3.0;
       }

   and suppose that vectors have 256 bits.  The vectorized f accesses
   will belong to one rgroup and the vectorized d access to another:

     f rgroup: nS = 2, nV = 1, nL = 8
     d rgroup: nS = 1, nV = 1, nL = 4
	       VF = 4

     [ In this simple example the rgroups do correspond to the normal
       SLP grouping scheme. ]

   If only the first three lanes are active, the masks we need are:

     f rgroup: 1 1 | 1 1 | 1 1 | 0 0
     d rgroup:  1  |  1  |  1  |  0

   Here we can use a mask calculated for f's rgroup for d's, but not
   vice versa.

   Thus for each value of nV, it is enough to provide nV masks, with the
   mask being calculated based on the highest nL (or, equivalently, based
   on the highest nS) required by any rgroup with that nV.  We therefore
   represent the entire collection of masks as a two-level table, with the
   first level being indexed by nV - 1 (since nV == 0 doesn't exist) and
   the second being indexed by the mask index 0 <= i < nV.  */
