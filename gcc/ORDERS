Free Software Redistributors Donate
***********************************

In adddition to their conference donation, Red Hat Software has agreed to
donate $1.00 to the FSF for every copy of Red Hat Archives sold.  They have
also added a GNU logo to the back of that CD with the words "Supports the
Free Software Foundation".

The SNOW 2.1 CD producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to the FSF"
to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how much of the
price is for the FSF & how much is for the redistributor.

The Sun Users Group Deutschland has made it even clearer: their CD says,
"Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the FSF." We thank them for their
contribution to our efforts.

Kyoto Micro Computer of Japan regularly gives us 10% of their GNU-related
sales.

Mr. Hiroshi, Mr. Kojima, and the other authors of the `Linux Primer' in Japan
have donated money from the sales of their book.

Infomagic has continued to make sizeable donations to the FSF.

At the request of author Arnold Robbins, Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc.
continues to donate 3% of their profits from selling `Effective AWK
Programming'.  We would also like to acknowledge the many SSC authors who
have donated their royalties and fees to the FSF.

In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity to
raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These redistributors
have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to waste.

You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves or by
donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect this
of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how much they give
to free software development.  Then you can show distributors they must
compete to be the one who gives the most.

To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such as,
"We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold." A vague
commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated," doesn't give you a
basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this
disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated
business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts
as profit.

Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
<contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else
would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU
compiler or Mach contribute more; major new features & programs contribute
the most.

By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the proper
thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can assure a
steady flow of resources for making more free software.

 

Help from Free Software Companies
*********************************

When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing money
to free software development or by writing free software improvements
themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially on this
factor, you can help encourage those who profit from free software to
contribute to its growth.

Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) regularly donates a part of its
income to the FSF to support the development of new GNU programs.  Listing
them here is our way of thanking them.  Wingnut has made a pledge to donate
10% of their income to the FSF, and has purchased several Deluxe Distribution
packages in Japan.  Also see *Note Cygnus Matches Donations!::.

Major Changes in GNU Software and Documentation
***********************************************

   * Hurd Progress   (Also *note What Is the Hurd::.)

     We have made two test releases of the Hurd, and we will make another
     (version 0.2) in this month.  Stability is improving, and we have begun
     modifying various user-level utilities to understand new Hurd filesystem
     features (fileutils, shellutils, tar, etc.).

     One way for people to help out is to compile and run as much third-party
     free software as they can; in this way we can find bugs and deficiencies
     with some rapidity.  Volunteers with a PC are therefore eagerly sought
     to get the new 0.2 release and compile their favorite Unix programs and
     games.

   * GNU System Progress

     Version 0.2 of the GNU system will be released in this month, to coincide
     with the 0.2 release of the Hurd.  This complete GNU system is available
     by FTP.  We are working with Ian Murdock to develop an excellent package
     management system for GNU.  This will make administering and upgrading
     the system much easier.  Because of features only the Hurd has, the GNU
     package management system will be simpler and more featureful than
     similar package systems for various GNU/Linux distributions.

   * New Source Code CD!   (See *Note January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs::)

     We are releasing the January 1997 (Edition 9) Source Code CD-ROM this
     month.  Once again, it is a two disk set.  It includes several new
     programs: `gforth', `gpc', <Meta-HTML>, `stow', `units', VRweb, `wget',
     `windows32api', and `xinfo'.  On the CD-ROMs are full distributions of
     X11R6.3, MIT Scheme, Emacs, GCC, and current versions of all other GNU
     Software.  *Note GNU Software::, for more about these packages.

   * New Compiler Tools CD-ROM  

     We are releasing the January 1997 (Edition 4) Compiler Tools Binaries
     CD.  Support is included for several new operating systems.

     The Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM contains executables of the GNU
     compiler tools for some systems that don't normally come with a
     compiler.  This allows users of those systems to compile their own
     software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.

     We hope to include more systems with each update of this CD-ROM.  If you
     can help build binaries for new systems or have one to suggest, please
     contact us at either address on the top menu.  For more information, see
     *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * New/Updated Manuals since Last Bulletin   (See *Note Documentation::)

     Since the last bulletin, we have published new editions of: `Debugging
     with GDB', for version 4.16 with a new color cover; `Texinfo' Manual,
     edition 2.24; & the `GNU Emacs Manual', for version 19.33 with a new
     color cover.  `Using and Porting GNU CC' has been re-printed in a
     lay-flat bound edition with a new color cover.  A new Bison Manual with
     a new color cover is planned.

   * Give to GNU the United Way!

     As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, the FSF is eligible to receive
     United Way funds.  When donating to United Way, one can specify that all
     or part of the donation be directed to the FSF.  On the donor form,
     check the "Specific Requests" box and include the sentence, "Send my
     gift to the Free Software Foundation, 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
     Boston, MA 02111." We especially appreciate the donations from Microsoft
     matching the United Way donations of their employees.  Also see *Note
     Donations Translate Into Free Software:: and *Note Cygnus Matches
     Donations!::.

   * GNU Software Works on MS-DOS   (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS for
     i386/i486/Pentium machines.  We ship binaries & sources on the *Note
     Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * MULE Merge Almost Complete

     MULE is the Multi-Lingual Emacs developed by Ken'ichi Handa at the
     Electro-Technical Lab in Tsukuba, Japan.  Handa has readied the code for
     merging into Emacs and we expect to complete the merge soon.

   * GCC   (For current status on GCC and GNAT, *note GNU Software::.)

     New front ends for GCC are being done for Pascal & Chill.  Pascal,
     `gpc', stagnated for some years, but should be released by the time you
     read this.  See `http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~gnu-pascal'.

   * GUILE

     GUILE is currently available as a test release.  GNU's Ubiquitous
     Intelligent Language for Extension is an SCM-based library that can make
     any ordinary C program extensible.  (For SCM info, see "JACAL" in *Note
     GNU Software::.)

     Also being developed are SCSH-compatible system call & Tk interfaces, a
     module system, dynamic linking support, & a byte-code interpreter.
     Support for Emacs Lisp & a more C-like language is coming.

   * Texinfo   (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     Texinfo now provides macro facilities and supports multicolumn tables.
     It comes with an `install-info' program that packages can use to update
     the `dir' file automatically when they install their Info files.

   * GNU Common Lisp   (For current status, *note GNU Software::.)

     Version 2.2.1 of GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was released in December '96.  It
     now includes a graphical interface to the Tk widget system.  All
     documentation is now Texinfo-based, with built-in regexp matching used
     to access the documentation.  A first pass at the Common Lisp condition
     system is also included.  Version 2.2.1 contains mainly updates to allow
     GCL 2.2 to work correctly with current operating system levels, and to
     fix bugs.  Volunteers to help with the move to the ANSI standard are
     most welcome; please contact `schelter@math.utexas.edu'.

   * Experimental Electronic Cash

     `http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/NCash' is an experimental
     implementation of anonymous electronic cash which is to be released as
     free software.

   * HTML Professional and GPL

     The recent development and release of HTML Professional was made under
     the terms of the GNU GPL.  In order to facilitate distribution, the GPL
     text was re-encoded into this more recent version of HTML, and is now
     distributed with HTML Pro.  An online copy can be retrieved at
     `http://www.arbornet.org/~silmaril/dtds/html/gnugpl.html'.

     HTML Pro is an unofficial version of the HTML DTD.  HTML Pro is
     distributed for discussion by the `www-html' mailing list.  It
     composites all other known versions, and allows World Wide Web designers
     to use recent experimental additions in a rational and structured manner.
     It comes with a `.ced' file for GNU Emacs/psgml-mode and can be gotten at
     `ftp://www.ucc.ie/pub/html/htmlpro.{zip|tar.gz|zip.hqx}'.
     Documentation is at
     `http://www.arbornet.org/~silmaril/dtds/html/htmlpro.html'.

   * Meta-HTML 5.01 Source Release

     Version 5.01 of Universal Access Inc.'s <Meta-HTML> is now available.

     <Meta-HTML> is a programming language specifically designed to work
     within the environment of the World Wide Web.  Although it is a genuine
     programming language, suitable for large-scale symbolic manipulation,
     <Meta-HTML> also provides the most commonly wanted Web functionality as
     built-in primitives, so you don't have to write them.  You can find out
     more about the theory of implementation in this white paper
     `http://www.metahtml.com/meta-html/manifesto.html'.

     Web pages are authored using HTML and <Meta-HTML> statements freely
     intermixed.  When a page is requested by a browser, the page is passed
     through the <Meta-HTML> engine, which dynamically processes any
     <Meta-HTML> statements to produce a final HTML page which is delivered
     to the browser.

     The source distribution provides several different interpreter options:
     a CGI engine which can be run by any Unix Web server; a full-featured
     Web server (mhttpd) with the interpreter built in; a standalone
     processor, much like Perl or Tcl; and an interactive debugger, with a
     feel similar to GDB (mdb).

     There is a user mailing list: `metahtml-users@metahtml.com'.  You can
     subscribe on the Web at `http://www.metahtml.com/E-Mail/', or by sending
     mail to `metahtml-users-request@metahtml.com'.

     Pre-compiled distribution sets for some systems are available via the
     <Meta-HTML> Web site at `http://www.metahtml.com'.

   * VRweb Browser

     VRweb, a browser for 3D models on the Web written in the Virtual Reality
     Modeling Language (VRML), is now available under the GPL.  VRweb works
     in conjunction with Web browsers on Unix & Windows platforms.

     VRweb is a joint project of IICM (home of Hyper-G), NCSA (home of
     Mosaic), & the University of Minnesota (home of Gopher).  The software
     is freely available in binary & source.  VRweb 1.2 for Unix has just
     been released, VRweb 1.2 for Windows will follow in due course.  You can
     download VRweb from `ftp://iicm.tu-graz.ac.at/pub/Hyper-G/VRweb/UNIX'
     and numerous mirror sites.  Further information on VRweb can be found at
     `http://hyperg.iicm.tu-graz.ac.at/vrweb'.

     VRML is a non-proprietary, platform-independent file format for 3D
     graphics on the Internet.  Also see `http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/',  the
     VRML Repository.



The Deluxe Distribution
***********************

The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code and
includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, & reference cards.

The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds of
different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C++ Compiler, the GNU Debugger,
the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating systems.  We
may be able to send someone to your office to do the compilation, if we can't
find a suitable machine here.  However, we can only compile the programs that
already support your chosen machine/system - porting is a separate matter.
(To commission a port, see the GNU Service Directory; details in *Note Free
Software Support::.) Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe
Distribution for an unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for
a common machine.  Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with "Rock
Ridge" extensions), or on one of these tapes in Unix `tar' format: 1600 or
6250bpi 1/2in reel, Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge - QIC24, IBM RS/6000 1/4in
c.t. - QIC 150, Exabyte 8mm c.t., or DAT 4mm c.t.  If your computer cannot
read any of these, please contact us to see if we can handle your format.

The manuals included are one each of `Bison', `Calc', `GAWK', `GCC', `GNU C
Library', `GDB', `Flex', `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference', `Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction', `Make', `Texinfo', & `Termcap' manuals; six copies of
the `GNU Emacs' manual; and ten reference cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc,
Flex, & GDB.

Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of our
CD-ROMs that have sources of our software & compiler tool binaries for some
systems.  The CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more free
software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution" section on the
*note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.  and send it to:

GNU Documentation
*****************

GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online & printed
documentation.  GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts,
describe how to use all the features of each program, & give examples of
command use.  GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which
yield both typeset hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online
hypertext display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals
comes with our software; here are the manuals that we publish as printed
books.  See the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::., to order them.

Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with "lay-flat" bindings.
This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without creasing the
binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer cardboard cover that
will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback will.  Currently, the
`Using and Porting GNU CC', `GDB', `Emacs', `Emacs Lisp Reference',
`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction', `GNU Awk User's Guide', `Make',
& `Bison' manuals have this binding.  Our other manuals also lie flat when
opened, using a GBC binding.  Our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in
by 11in `Calc' manual.

The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was published.

`Debugging with GDB' (for Version 4.16) tells how to run your program under
GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a program's flow of
control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

The `GNU Emacs Manual' (12th Edition for Version 19.33) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and regular
expression search; how to use special programming modes to write languages
like C++ and TeX; how to use the `tags' utility; how to compile and correct
code; how to make your own keybindings; and other elementary customizations.

`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction' (October 1995 Edition 1.04) is
for people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do want
to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you read it in Emacs
under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

`The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) and
`The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition' (Japanese Draft Revision
1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) cover this programming
language in depth, including data types, control structures, functions,
macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes, windows, keymaps, byte
compilation, and the operating system interface.

`The GNU Awk User's Guide' (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0) tells how to use
`gawk'.  It is written for those who have never used `awk' and describes
features of this powerful string and record manipulation language.  It
clearly delineates those features which are part of POSIX `awk' from `gawk'
extensions, providing a comprehensive guide to `awk' program portability.

`GNU Make' (Edition 0.50 for Version 3.75 Beta) describes GNU `make', a
program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual tells how to
write "makefiles", which specify how a program is to be compiled and how its
files depend on each other.  Included are an introductory chapter for novice
users and a section about automatically generated dependencies.

The `Flex' manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to write a
lexical scanner definition for the `flex' program to create a C++ or C-coded
scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need no prior knowledge of
scanners.

`The Bison Manual' (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches you how
to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert into
C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

`Using and Porting GNU CC' (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2) tells
how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It lists
new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar with C
will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It also
covers G++.

The `Texinfo' manual (Edition 2.24 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation & typeset hardcopies.
It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes, accented & special
characters, indexes, cross references, & how to catch mistakes.

`The Termcap Manual' (3rd Edition for Version 1.3), often described as "twice
as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details the format of the
termcap database, the definitions of terminal capabilities, and the process
of interrogating a terminal description.  This manual is primarily for
programmers.

The `C Library Reference Manual' (Edition 0.08 for Version 2.0) describes the
library's facilities, including both what Unix calls "library functions" &
"system calls."  We are doing small copier runs of this manual until it
becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to `bug-glibc-manual@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

The `Emacs Calc Manual' (for Version 2.02) is both a tutorial and a reference
manual.  It tells how to do ordinary arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra,
calculus, and other forms of mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

 

GNU Software
************

All our software is available via FTP; see *Note How to Get GNU Software::.
We also offer *Note CD-ROMs::, and printed *Note Documentation::, which
includes manuals and reference cards.  In the articles describing the
contents of each medium, the version number listed after each program name
was current when we published this Bulletin.  When you order a newer CD-ROM,
some of the programs may be newer and therefore the version number higher.
See the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::., for ordering
information.

Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We have
software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to patent troubles
with `compress', we use another compression program, `gzip'.  (Such
prohibitions on software development are fought by the League for Programming
Freedom; *note What Is the LPF::., for details.)

You may need to build GNU `make' before you build our other software.  Some
vendors supply no `make' utility at all and some native `make' programs lack
the `VPATH' feature essential for using the GNU configure system to its full
extent.  The GNU `make' sources have a shell script to build `make' itself on
such systems.

We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (*note Free Software Support::.).

 

Configuring GNU Software
------------------------

We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages
in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below, in this
article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same alternatives
for naming machine and system types.

Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system all
at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package separately.

You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.  Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated
configure scripts.

 

GNU Software Now Available

Key to cross reference:

        BinCD        January 1997 Binaries CD-ROM
        SrcCD        January 1997 Source CD-ROMs

[FSFman] shows that we sell a manual for that package.  [FSFrc] shows we sell
a reference card for that package.  To order them, see the *note Free
Software Foundation Order Form::.  *Note Documentation::, for more
information on the manuals.  Source code for each manual or reference card is
included with each package.

   * `acm'   (SrcCD)

     `acm' is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that runs
     under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat against
     one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.  We are working on
     a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight characteristics.

   * Apache   *Also see* `http://www.apache.org/'   (SrcCD)

     Apache is an HTTP server designed as a successor to the NCSA family of
     web servers.  It adds a significant amount of new functionality, has an
     extensive API for modular enhancements, is extremely flexible without
     compromising speed, and has an active development group and user
     community.

   * Autoconf   (SrcCD)

     Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
     packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
     systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for
     a package from a template file which lists the operating system features
     which the package can use, in the form of `m4' macro calls.  Autoconf
     requires GNU `m4' to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
     generates do not.

   * Automake   (SrcCD)

     Automake is a tool for generating `Makefile.in's for use with Autoconf.
     The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile standards.

   * BASH   (SrcCD)

     GNU's shell, BASH (Bourne Again SHell), is compatible with the Unix `sh'
     and offers many extensions found in `csh' and `ksh'.  BASH has job
     control, `csh'-style command history, command-line editing (with Emacs
     and `vi' modes built-in), and the ability to rebind keys via the
     `readline' library.  BASH conforms to the POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

   * `bc'   (SrcCD)

     `bc' is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
     numbers.  GNU `bc' follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard with several
     extensions, including multi-character variable names, an `else'
     statement, and full Boolean expressions.  The RPN calculator `dc' is now
     distributed as part of the same package, but GNU `bc' is not implemented
     as a `dc' preprocessor.

   * BFD   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The Binary File Descriptor library allows a program which operates on
     object files (e.g., `ld' or GDB) to support many different formats in a
     clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so that only BFD needs to
     know the details of a particular format.  One result is that all
     programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF, and ELF.
     BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet published on paper).

     At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
     packages that use it.

   * Binutils   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     Binutils includes these programs: `ar', `c++filt', `demangle', `gas',
     `gprof', `ld', `nlmconv', `nm', `objcopy', `objdump', `ranlib', `size',
     `strings', & `strip'.

     Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, `gas',
     supports the a29k, Alpha, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k, m88k,
     MIPS, NS32K, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and attempts to be
     compatible with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It
     can produce mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility
     similar to that in some other assemblers.  GNU's linker, `ld', emits
     source-line numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and
     undefined references, and interprets a superset of AT&T's Linker Command
     Language, which gives control over where segments are placed in memory.
     `nlmconv' converts object files into Novell NetWare Loadable Modules.
     `objdump' can disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and
     can display other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file
     format read by BFD.

   * Bison   *See *Note Documentation::* (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
     `yacc'.  Texinfo source for the `Bison Manual' and reference card are
     included.

   * C Library   *See *Note Forthcoming GNUs::*   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
     1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the underlying
     system permits), & most of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is
     nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2 specification which guarantees
     upward compatibility with 4.4BSD & many System V functions.

     When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
     Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast `malloc'
     which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.

     GNU `stdio' lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a few
     C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help writing
     internationalized programs & the user can adopt the environment the
     program runs in to conform with local conventions.  Extended `getopt'
     functions are already used to parse options, including long options, in
     many GNU utilities.  The name lookup functions now are modularized which
     makes it easier to select the service which is needed for the specific
     database & the document interface makes it easy to add new services.
     Texinfo source for the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' is included
     (*note Documentation::.).

     Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of systems.
     The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not been updated
     since development on version 2.0 started, so today it runs out of the
     box only on GNU/Hurd (all platforms GNU/Hurd also runs on) & GNU/Linux
     (ix86, Alpha, m68k, work is in progress for MIPS & Sparc).  Other
     architectures will become available again as soon as somebody does the
     port.

   * C++ Library   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The GNU C++ library (libg++) contains an extensive collection of
     container and utility classes, including Obstacks, multiple-precision
     Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers, BitSets, and BitStrings.

     The distribution also includes the libstdc++ library.  This implements
     library facilities defined by the forthcoming ANSI/ISO C++ standard,
     including strings, the iostream library, and a port of the Standard
     Template Library.

   * Calc   (SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
     desk calculator & mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
     can use Calc as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many more
     features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
     logarithmic, trigonometric, & financial functions; arbitrary precision;
     complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
     algebraic simplification; & differentiation & integration.  It outputs to
     `gnuplot', & comes with source for a manual & reference card (*note
     Documentation::.).

   * `cfengine'   (SrcCD)

     `cfengine' is used to maintain site-wide configuration of a
     heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
     appearance is similar to `rdist', but allows many more operations to be
     performed automatically.  See Mark Burgess, "A Site Configuration
     Engine", `Computing Systems', Vol. 8, No. 3 (ask `office@usenix.org' how
     to get a copy).

   * Chess   (SrcCD)

     GNU Chess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess.  It has
     a plain terminal interface, a curses interface, & the unique X Windows
     interface `xboard'.  Best results are obtained using GNU C to compile
     GNU Chess.

     Recent improvements include "configure"-capability, correct thinking on
     opponent's time, makefile for Windows NT, full Windows 95/NT
     compatibility, parallel Unix & Windows 95/NT versions, major crash bug
     fix & various other minor improvements & bug fixes.

     Stuart Cracraft founded GNU Chess & is the project lead for the 10+ year
     history of GNU Chess.  Acknowledgements for this past year's work
     include Chua Kong Sian, National Supercomputing Research Center,
     Singapore; & Conor McCarthy, Biomolecular/Biomed Science at Griffith
     University, Australia.

   * CLISP   (SrcCD)

     CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible & Michael Stoll.
     It mostly supports the Lisp described by `Common LISP: The Language (2nd
     edition)' & the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
     interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS & a foreign language
     interface.  The user interface language (English, German, French) can be
     chosen at run time.  An X11 API is available through CLX & Garnet.
     CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory & runs on many microcomputers (including
     MS-DOS systems, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga 500-4000, & Acorn
     RISC PC) & all kinds of Unix systems.

   * Common Lisp   *Also *note GNUs Flashes::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
     & interpreter for Common Lisp.  GCL is very portable & extremely
     efficient on a wide class of applications, & compares favorably in
     performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem-prover &
     symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
     moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.

     GCL compiles to C & then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
     GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args & one value turns into a C
     function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
     maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
     gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in registers.
     It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code & displays
     source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler (based on the C profiling
     tools) counts function calls & the time spent in each function.

     There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs in a
     separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp computations or
     interact with running computations via a windowing interface.

     There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
     does PCL (see "PCL" later in this article).

     GCL version 2.2.1 is released under the GNU Library General Public
     License.

   * CLX   (SrcCD)

     CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.  This is separate from the
     built-in TK interface.

   * `cpio'   (SrcCD)

     `cpio' is an archive program with all the features of SVR4 `cpio',
     including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard.  `mt', a
     program to position magnetic tapes, is included with `cpio'.

   * CVS   (SrcCD)

     CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows you to
     keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who,
     when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles multiple developers,
     multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations,
     and can work over a wide area network.  It does not handle build
     management or bug-tracking; these are handled by `make' and GNATS,
     respectively.

   * DejaGnu   (SrcCD)

     DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all
     tests.  DejaGnu's flexibility & consistency makes it easy to write tests.
     DejaGnu will also work with remote hosts and embedded systems.

     DejaGnu comes with `expect', which runs scripts to conduct dialogs with
     programs.

   * Diffutils   (SrcCD)

     GNU `diff' compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
     flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
     Diffutils package has `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', & `cmp'.  Future plans
     include support for internationalization (e.g., error messages in
     Chinese) & some non-Unix PC environments, & a library interface that can
     be used by other free software.

   * DJGPP   *Also see "GCC" in this article*   (BinCD)

     DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G++ to i386s running DOS.  DJGPP has a 32-bit
     i386 DOS extender with a symbolic debugger, development libraries, &
     ports of Bison, `flex', & Binutils.  Full source code is provided.  It
     needs at least 5MB of hard disk space to install & 512K of RAM to use.
     It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768), XMS & VDISK memory allocation,
     `himem.sys', VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, & 386MAX), & DPMI (e.g.,
     Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, & QDPMI).  Version 2 was released in Feb. 1996,
     & needs a DPMI environment; a free DPMI server is included.

     FTP from `ftp.simtel.net' in `/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/' (or a SimTel
     mirror site).

     Ask `listserv@delorie.com', to join a DJGPP users mailing list.

   * `dld'   (SrcCD)

     `dld' is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your program
     with the `dld' library allows you to dynamically load object files into
     the running binary.  `dld' supports a.out object types on the following
     platforms: Convex C-Series (BSD), i386/i486/Pentium (GNU/Linux), Sequent
     Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3), Sun-3 (SunOS 3 & 4), Sun-4 (SunOS 4), & VAX
     (Ultrix).

   * `doschk'   (SrcCD)

     This program is a utility to help software developers ensure that their
     source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms with
     14-character filenames and on MS-DOS systems with 8+3 character
     filenames.

   * `ed'   (SrcCD)

     `ed' is the standard text editor.  It is line-oriented and can be used
     interactively or in scripts.

   * Elib   (SrcCD)

     Elib is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
     using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

   * Elisp archive   (SrcCD)

     This is a snapshot of Ohio State's GNU Emacs Lisp FTP Archive.  FTP it
     from `archive.cis.ohio-state.edu' in `/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive'.

   * Emacs   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
     customizable real-time display editor & computing environment.  GNU Emacs
     is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated
     into the editor--for writing extensions & provides an interface to the X
     Window System.  It runs on Unix, MS-DOS, & Windows NT or 95.  In
     addition to its powerful native command set, Emacs can emulate the
     editors vi & EDT (DEC's VMS editor).  Emacs has many other features which
     make it a full computing support environment.  Source for the `GNU Emacs
     Manual' & a reference card comes with the software.  Sources for the
     `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual', & `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
     Introduction' are distributed in separate packages.  *Note
     Documentation::.

   * Emacs 19   (SrcCD)   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     Emacs 19 works with character-only terminals & with the X Window System
     (with or without an X toolkit).  Features new to Emacs 19 include:
     multiple X windows ("frames" to Emacs), with a separate X window for the
     minibuffer or a minibuffer attached to each X window; use of the X
     toolkit; interfacing with the X resource manager; property lists
     associated with regions of text in a buffer; multiple fonts & colors
     defined by those properties; simplified/improved processing of function
     keys, mouse movement & clicks; X selection processing, including
     clipboard selections; hooks to be run if the point or mouse moves
     outside a certain range; menu bars & popup menus defined by keymaps;
     scrollbars; before- & after-change hooks; a source-level debugger for
     Emacs Lisp programs; floating point numbers; improved buffer allocation,
     including returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed; many
     updated libraries; Autoconf-based configuration; support for version
     control systems (CVS, RCS, & SCCS); & European character sets.

     Features added recently to Emacs 19 include the ability to open frames
     on more than one X display from a single Emacs job, operation under
     MS-DOS, MS Windows, and Windows NT, displaying multiple views of an
     outline at the same time, Lisp-level timers for real time and idle time,
     version control support for CVS and for multiple branches, text
     properties for formatting text, commands to edit text properties and
     save them in files, and GNU-standard long-named command line options.

   * Emacs 18   (SrcCD)   [FSFrc]

     Emacs 18 is several years old.  We no longer maintain it, but still
     distribute it for those using platforms which Emacs 19 does not support:
     Alliant FX/80, Altos 3068, Amdahl (UTS), AT&T (3Bs & 7300 PC), CCI 5/32
     & 6/32, Celerity, DEC (VAX VMS), Dual, Encore (APC, DPC, & XPC), HLH
     Orion (original & 1/05), ISI (Optimum V, 80386), Masscomp, NCR Tower 32

     Triton 88, Ustation E30 (SS5E), Whitechapel (MG1), & Wicat.

   * `es'   (SrcCD)

     `es' is an extensible shell (based on `rc') with first-class functions,
     lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e., functions can
     return values other than just numbers).  `es''s extensibility comes from
     the ability to modify and extend the shell's built-in services, such as
     path searching and redirection.  Like `rc', it is great for both
     interactive use and scripting, particularly since its quoting rules are
     much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

   * `enscript'   (SrcCD)

     `enscript' is an upwardly-compatible replacement for the Adobe
     `enscript' program.  It formats ASCII files (outputting in Postscript)
     and stores generated output to a file or sends it directly to the
     printer.

   * Exim   (SrcCD)

     Exim is a new Internet mail transfer agent, similar in style to Smail 3.
     It can handle relatively high volume mail systems, header rewriting,
     control over which hosts/nets may use it as a relay, blocking of
     unwanted mail from specified hosts/nets/senders, and multiple local
     domains on one mail host ("virtual domains") with several options for
     the way these are handled.

   * `f2c'   *Also see "Fortran" below & in *Note Forthcoming GNUs::*  
     (SrcCD)

     `f2c' converts Fortran-77 source into C or C++, which can be compiled
     with GCC or G++.  Get bug fixes by FTP from site `netlib.bell-labs.com'
     or by email from `netlib@netlib.bell-labs.com'.  For a summary, see the
     file `/netlib/f2c/readme.Z'.

   * `ffcall'   (SrcCD)

     `ffcall' is a C library for implementing foreign function calls in
     embedded interpreters by Bill Triggs and Bruno Haible.  It allows C
     functions with arbitrary argument lists and return types to be called or
     emulated (callbacks).

   * Fileutils   (SrcCD)

     The Fileutils are: `chgrp', `chmod', `chown', `cp', `dd', `df', `dir',
     `dircolors', `du', `install', `ln', `ls', `mkdir', `mkfifo', `mknod',
     `mv', `rm', `rmdir', `sync', `touch', & `vdir'.

   * Findutils   (SrcCD)

     `find' is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
     find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations
     on them.  Also included are `locate', which scans a database for file
     names that match a pattern, and `xargs', which applies a command to a
     list of files.

   * Finger   (SrcCD)

     GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
     many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger "server" host
     and other hosts at that site configured as finger "clients".  The server
     host collects information about who is logged in on the clients.  To
     finger a user at a GNU Finger site, a query to any of its client hosts
     gets useful information.  GNU Finger supports many customization
     features, including user output filters and site-programmable output for
     special target names.

   * `flex'   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     `flex' is a replacement for the `lex' scanner generator.  `flex' was
     written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and generates
     far more efficient scanners than `lex' does.  Sources for the `Flex
     Manual' and reference card are included (*note Documentation::.).

   * Fortran (`g77')   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU Fortran (`g77'), developed by Craig Burley, is available for public
     beta testing on the Internet.  For now, `g77' produces code that is
     mostly object-compatible with `f2c' & uses the same run-time library
     (`libf2c').

   * Fontutils   (SrcCD)

     The Fontutils convert between font formats, create fonts for use with
     Ghostscript or TeX (starting with a scanned type image & converting the
     bitmaps to outlines), etc.  It includes: `bpltobzr', `bzrto',
     `charspace', `fontconvert', `gsrenderfont', `imageto', `imgrotate',
     `limn', & `xbfe'.

   * GAWK   (SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     GAWK is upwardly compatible with the latest POSIX specification of
     `awk'.  It also provides several useful extensions not found in other
     `awk' implementations.  Texinfo source for the `The GNU Awk User's
     Guide' comes with the software (*note Documentation::.).

   * `gcal'   (SrcCD)

     `gcal' is a program for printing calendars.  It displays different
     styled calendar sheets, eternal holiday lists, and fixed date warning
     lists.

   * GCC   *Also *note GNUs Flashes::.*   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C++, and
     Objective-C; the source file name suffix or a compiler option selects
     the language.  (Also see "GNAT" later in this article for Ada language
     supports.) Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support
     needed to run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this
     does not include any Objective-C classes aside from `object', but see
     "GNUstep" in *Note Forthcoming GNUs::).  As much as possible, G++ is
     kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard, but not with
     `cfront' (AT&T's compiler), which has been diverging from ANSI.

     GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs many
     optimizations.  They include: automatic register allocation, common
     sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain amount of CSE
     between basic blocks - though not all the supported machine descriptions
     provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion from
     loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
     propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
     elimination, integration of inline functions & frame pointer elimination,
     instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf
     function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, the
     ability to assign attributes to instructions, & many local optimizations
     automatically deduced from the machine description.

     GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type `long long
     int').  It supports extended floating point (type `long double') on the
     68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional
     C, & GNU C extensions (including: nested functions support, nonlocal
     gotos, & taking the address of a label).

     GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, & OSF-Rose files when used with a
     suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
     formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, & DWARF.

     GCC generates code for many CPUs, including the a29k, Alpha, ARM, AT&T,
     DSP1610, Clipper, Convex cN, Elxsi, Fujitsu Gmicro, i370, i860, i960,
     MIL-STD-1750a, MIPS, ns32k, PDP-11, Pyramid, ROMP, RS/6000, SH, SPUR,
     Tahoe, VAX, & we32k.

     Position-independent code is generated for the Clipper, Hitachi H8/300,
     HP-PA (1.0 & 1.1), i386/i486/Pentium, m68k, m88k, SPARC, & SPARClite.

     Operating systems supported include: GNU/Hurd, GNU/Linux, ACIS, AIX, AOS,
     BSD, Clix, Concentrix, Ctix, DG/UX, Dynix, FreeBSD, Genix, HP-UX, Irix,
     ISC, Luna, LynxOS, Minix, NetBSD, NewsOS, NeXTStep, OS/2, OSF, OSF-Rose,
     RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2, SunOS 4, System/370, SysV, Ultrix, Unos, VMS, &
     Windows/NT.

     Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
     easy as building a native compiler.

     Version 1 of GCC, G++, & libg++ are no longer maintained.

     Texinfo source for the `Using and Porting GNU CC' manual is included
     with GCC (*note Documentation::.).

   * GDB   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     GDB, the GNU DeBugger, is a source-level debugger for C, C++, & Fortran.
     It provides partial support for  Modula-2 & Chill.

     GDB can debug both C & C++, & will work with executables made by many
     different compilers; but, C++ debugging will have some limitations if
     you do not use GCC.

     GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
     interface.  Two X interfaces (not distributed or maintained by the FSF)
     are: `gdbtk' (FTP it from `ftp.cygnus.com' in directory `/pub/gdb'); and
     `xxgdb' (FTP it from `ftp.x.org' in directory `/contrib/utilities').

     Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
     allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
     formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
     language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
     (breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

     GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which (so
     far) has simulators for the ARM, Hitachi H8/300, Hitachi H8/500, Hitachi
     Super-H, PowerPC, WDC 65816, & Zilog Z8001/2.

     GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB "targets" a platform
     means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB
     can "host" a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
     necessarily debug native programs.

     GDB can:

        * "target" & "host": Amiga 3000 (Amix, NetBSD), DEC Alpha (OSF/1),
          DECstation 3100 & 5000 (Ultrix), HP 9000/300 (BSD, HP-UX), HP

        * "host", but not "target": IBM RT/PC (AIX), HP/Apollo 68k (BSD), &
          m68k Apple Macintosh (MacOS).  Sources for the manual,
     `Debugging with GDB', and a reference card are included (*note
     Documentation::.).

   * `gdbm'   (SrcCD)

     `gdbm' is the GNU replacement for the traditional `dbm' and `ndbm'
     libraries.  It implements a database using quick lookup by hashing.
     `gdbm' does not ordinarily make sparse files (unlike its Unix and BSD
     counterparts).

   * `gettext'    *Also *note Help the GNU Translation Project::.*   (SrcCD)

     The GNU `gettext' tool set has everything maintainers need to
     internationalize a package's user messages.  Once a package has been
     internationalized, `gettext''s many tools help translators localize
     messages to their native language and automate handling the translation
     files.

   * Generic NQS   (SrcCD)

     Generic NQS is a network queuing system for spreading batch jobs across a
     network of machines.  It is designed to be simple to install on a
     heterogeneous network of machines, and has optimizations for running on
     the high end, symmetric multiprocessing servers that are currently on the
     market.  It is available for many more UNIX variants than any other
     comparable product, and inter-operates with other NQS systems, including
     Cray's NQE.

   * `geomview'   *See* `http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/geomview'   (SrcCD)

     `geomview' is an interactive geometry viewing program, for UNIX systems
     with Motif, using X, GL, or OpenGL graphics.  It allows multiple
     independently controllable objects and cameras.  `geomview' provides
     interactive control for motion, appearances (including lighting,
     shading, and materials), picking on an object, edge or vertex level, and
     snapshots in PPM or SGI image files, Postscript, and Renderman RIB
     format.  `geomview' can be controlled through direct mouse manipulation,
     control panels, and keyboard shortcuts.  External programs can also
     drive desired aspects of the viewer (such as continually loading
     changing geometry or controlling the motion of certain objects) while
     allowing interactive control of everything else.

   * `gforth'   (SrcCD)

     `gforth' is a fast, portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.

   * Ghostscript   (SrcCD)

     Ghostscript is an interpreter for the Postscript and PDF graphics
     languages.

     The current version of GNU Ghostscript, 3.33, includes nearly a full
     Postscript Level 2 interpreter and a PDF 1.0 interpreter.  Significant
     new features include: support for anti-aliased characters; the ability
     to scan a directory and register all the fonts in it; support for Type 0
     (Japanese / Chinese / Korean) fonts; and the ability to compile all the
     external initialization files into the executable.  This version can
     also run as a 32-bit MS Windows application.

     Thanks to the generosity of URW++ (Hamburg, Germany), the low-quality
     bitmap-derived fonts distributed with older versions have been replaced
     with commercial-quality, hinted outline fonts.

     Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language by writing
     directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to files for
     printing later or manipulating with other graphics programs.

     Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
     that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
     i386/i486/Pentiums running DOS with EGA, VGA or SuperVGA graphics (but
     please do *not* ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not
     use DOS).

   * Ghostview   (SrcCD)

     Tim Theisen, `ghostview@cs.wisc.edu', created Ghostview, a previewer for
     multi-page files with an X Window interface.  Ghostview & Ghostscript
     work together; Ghostview creates a viewing window & Ghostscript draws in
     it.

   * GIT   (SrcCD)

     The GNU Interactive Tools package includes: an extensible file system
     browser, an ASCII/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer, & other
     related utilities & shell scripts.  It can be used to increase the speed
     & efficiency of many daily tasks, such as copying & moving files &
     directories, invoking editors, compressing/uncompressing files, creating
     & expanding archives, compiling programs, sending mail, etc.  It looks
     nice, has colors (if the standard ANSI color sequences are supported), &
     is user-friendly.

   * `gmp'   (SrcCD)

     GNU `mp' is a library for arithmetic on arbitrary precision integers,
     rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.  It has a rich set of
     functions with a regular interface.

     previous versions, it is much faster, contains lots of new functions, &
     has support for arbitrary precision floating-point numbers.

   * Gnans    (SrcCD)

     Gnans is a program (and language) for the numerical study of
     deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems.  The dynamical systems
     may evolve in continuous or discrete time.  Gnans has graphical &
     command line interfaces.

   * GNAT: The GNU Ada Translator   (SrcCD)

     GNAT, a front end for the entire Ada 95 language, including all special
     needs annexes, is available via anonymous FTP from `cs.nyu.edu' and
     various mirror sites in `/pub/gnat'.  SGI, DEC, and Siemens Nixdorf have
     chosen GNU Ada 95 as the Ada compiler for their systems.  GNAT is
     maintained by Ada Core Technologies.  For more information, see
     `http://www.gnat.com'.

   * GNATS   (SrcCD)

     GNATS, GNats: A Tracking System, is a bug-tracking system.  It is based
     upon the paradigm of a central site or organization which receives
     problem reports and negotiates their resolution by electronic mail.
     Although it has been used primarily as a software bug-tracking system so
     far, it is sufficiently generalized that it could be used for handling
     system administration issues, project management, or any number of other
     applications.

   * GNUMATH (`gnussl')   (SrcCD)

     GNUMATH is a library (`gnussl') that simplifies scientific programming
     in C & C++.  Its focus is on problems that can be solved by a
     straight-forward application of numerical linear algebra.  It also
     handles plotting.  It is in beta release; it is expected to grow more
     versatile & offer a wider scope in time.

   * `gnuplot'   (SrcCD)

     `gnuplot' is an interactive program for plotting mathematical
     expressions and data.  It plots both curves (2 dimensions) & surfaces (3
     dimensions).  It was neither written nor named for the GNU Project; the
     name is a coincidence.  Various GNU programs use `gnuplot'.

   * `gnuserv'   (SrcCD)

     `gnuserv' is an enhanced version of Emacs' `emacsclient' program.  It
     lets the user direct a running Emacs to edit files or evaluate arbitrary
     Emacs Lisp constructs from another process.

     `gperf' generates perfect hash tables.  The C version is in package
     cperf.  The C++ version is in libg++.  Both produce hash functions in
     either C or C++.

   * Graphics   (SrcCD)

     GNU Graphics produces x-y plots from ASCII or binary data.  It outputs
     in Postscript, Tektronix 4010 compatible, and Unix device-independent
     "plot" formats.  It has a previewer for the X Window System.  Features
     include a `spline' interpolation program; examples of shell scripts
     using `graph' and `plot'; a statistics toolkit; and output in TekniCAD
     TDA and ln03 file formats.  Email bugs or queries to Rich Murphey,
     `Rich@lamprey.utmb.edu'.

     version of `troff', & includes: `eqn', `nroff', `pic', `refer', `tbl',
     `troff'; the `man', `ms', & `mm' macros; & drivers for Postscript, TeX
     `dvi' format, the LaserJet 4 series of printers, and typewriter-like
     devices.  Groff's `mm' macro package is almost compatible with the DWB
     `mm' macros with several extensions.  Also included is a modified
     version of the Berkeley `me' macros and an enhanced version of the X11
     `xditview' previewer.  Written in C++, these programs can be compiled
     with GNU C++ Version 2.7.2 or later.

     Groff users are encouraged to contribute enhancements.  Most needed are
     complete Texinfo documentation, a `grap' emulation (a `pic' preprocessor
     for typesetting graphs), a page-makeup postprocessor similar to `pm'
     (see `Computing Systems', Vol. 2, No. 2; ask `office@usenix.org' how to
     get a copy), and an ASCII output class for `pic' to integrate `pic' with
     Texinfo.  Questions and bug reports from users who have read the
     documentation provided with Groff can be sent to
     `bug-groff@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   * `gzip'   (SrcCD)

     `gzip' can expand LZW-compressed files but uses another, unpatented
     algorithm for compression which generally produces better results.  It
     also expands files compressed with System V's `pack' program.

   * `hello'   (SrcCD)

     The GNU `hello' program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
     allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
     otherwise be unavailable to them.  Because it is protected by the GNU
     General Public License, users are free to share and change it.  `hello'
     is also a good example of a program that meets the GNU coding standards.
     Like any truly useful program, `hello' contains a built-in mail reader.

   * `hp2xx'   (SrcCD)

     GNU `hp2xx' reads HP-GL files, decomposes all drawing commands into
     elementary vectors, and converts them into a variety of vector and raster
     output formats.  It is also an HP-GL previewer.  Currently supported
     vector formats include encapsulated Postscript, Uniplex RGIP, Metafont,
     various special TeX-related formats, and simplified HP-GL (line drawing
     only) for imports.  Raster formats supported include IMG, PBM, PCX, &
     HP-PCL (including Deskjet & DJ5xxC support).  Previewers work under X11

     <Meta-HTML> is a programming language specifically designed for working
     within the World Wide Web environment.  Although it is a genuine
     programming language, suitable for large-scale symbolic manipulation, it
     provides the most commonly wanted Web functionality as built-in
     primitives, so you don't have to write them.

   * Midnight Commander (`mc')   (SrcCD)

     The Midnight Commander is a user friendly & colorful Unix file manager &
     shell, useful to novice & guru alike.  It has a built-in virtual file

     external Unix programs.

   * Miscellaneous Files Distribution   (SrcCD)

     The GNU Miscellaneous Files are non-crucial files that are common on
     various systems, including word lists, airport codes, ZIP codes etc.

   * `mkisofs'   (SrcCD)

     `mkisofs' is a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO 9660 file system.
     It takes a snapshot of a directory tree, and makes a binary image which
     corresponds to an ISO 9660 file system when written to a block device.

     It can also generate the System Use Sharing Protocol records of the Rock
     Ridge Interchange Protocol (used to further describe the files in an ISO
     9660 file system to a Unix host; it provides information such as longer
     filenames, uid/gid, permissions, and device nodes).

     The `mkisofs' program is often used with `cdwrite'.  The `cdwrite'
     program works by taking the image that `mkisofs' generates and driving a
     cdwriter drive to actually burn the disk.  `cdwrite' works under
     GNU/Linux, and supports popular cdwriter drives.  Older versions of
     `cdwrite' were included with older versions of `mkisofs';
     `sunsite.unc.edu' has the latest version:
     `/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/cdwrite-2.0.tar.gz'.

   * `mtools'   (SrcCD)

     for all of them.  MULE is being merged into GNU Emacs.  *Note GNU &
     Other Free Software in Japan::, for more information about MULE.

   * `ncurses'   (SrcCD)

     `ncurses' implements the Unix `curses' API for developing screen-based
     programs that are terminal independent.  It is not merely an emulation
     of old (BSD) curses/termcap, but is fully compatible with SVR4
     curses/terminfo.  It includes color, multiple-highlight, & xterm

     It handles multiple input files at once, has TeX compatible output, &
     outputs readable "KWIC" (KeyWords In Context) indexes without using
     `nroff'.

     It does not yet handle input files that do not fit in memory all at once.

   * `rc'   (SrcCD)

     `rc' is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than `csh')
     and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.  It's
     intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
     scripts.  It inspired the shell `es'.

     RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &
     management of software projects.  Used with GNU `diff', RCS can handle
     binary files (8-bit data, executables, object files, etc).  RCS now
     conforms to GNU configuration standards & to POSIX 1003.1b-1993.  Also
     see the CVS item above.

   * `recode'    *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
     exact transliterations are not possible, it may delete the offending
     characters or fall back on approximations.  This program recognizes or
     outputs nearly 150 different character sets and is able to transliterate
     files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character sets are
     supported.

   * `regex'   (SrcCD)

     The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
     internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU programs which
     do regular expression matching & is available separately.  An alternate
     regular expression package, `rx', is faster than `regex' in many cases;
     we were planning to replace `regex' with `rx', but it is not certain
     this will happen.

   * Roxen   (SrcCD)

     Roxen is a modularized, object-oriented, non-forking World Wide Web

     We now distribute MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the "Revised^4
     Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme" (MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for
     which TeX source is included.  It is written partly in C, but is
     presently hard to bootstrap.  Binaries to bootstrap it exist for: HP9000
     series 300, 400, 700, & 800 (running HP-UX 9.0), NeXT (NeXT OS 2 or 3.2),
     DEC Alpha (OSF/1), IBM RS/6000 (AIX), Sun-3 or Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1),
     DECstation 3100/5100 (Ultrix 4.0), Sony NeWS-3250 (NEWS OS 5.01), &
     Intel i386 (MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or NT).  If your system isn't on this
     list & you don't enjoy the bootstrap challenge, see "JACAL" earlier in
     this article.

     X3.64) functions, including color.  Arbitrary keyboard input translation
     is also supported.  `screen' sessions can be detached and resumed later
     on a different terminal type.  Output in detached sessions is saved for
     later viewing.

   * `sed'   (SrcCD)

     `sed' is a stream-oriented version of `ed'.  It comes with the `rx'
     library.

     GNU Shogi is a variant of GNU Chess; it implements the same features &
     similar heuristics.  As a new feature, sequences of partial board
     patterns can be introduced to help the program play toward specific
     opening patterns.  It has both character and X display interfaces.

     It is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

   * SIPP    (SrcCD)

     SIPP is a library for photorealisticly rendering 3D scenes.  Scenes can

CD-ROMs
*******

We offer these CD-ROMs:

   * Several editions of our *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::.

   * January 1997 *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * December 1995 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the *note Free
     Software Foundation Order Form::.

   * December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the *note Free
     Software Foundation Order Form::.

   * December 1993 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM, see the *note Free
     Software Foundation Order Form::.

Our CDs are in ISO 9660 format & can be mounted as a read-only file system on
most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each CD with "Rock
Ridge" extensions & it will look like a regular Unix file system, rather than
one full of truncated & otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO 9660.

You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

 

Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs
--------------------------

If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the January 1997 Source CD
set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out of
your own pocket.  The January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs $220
for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

 

What Do the Different Prices Mean?
..................................

The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company or
other organization buys the January 1997 Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.
When an individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.  This
distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In either
case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you wish and
there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price distinction is
entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.

You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an individual.
But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the disk is really
for the company; so please pay the company price and get reimbursed for it.
We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor system--so please cooperate.

Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
150 Source CDs at that price support an FSF programmer or tech writer for a
year.

 

Why Is There an Individual Price?
.................................

In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.  The CD
at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a much lower
price than they would previously have paid for six different tapes.  To lower
the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very badly and decrease the
software development we can do.

However, for individuals, $240 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the lower
price of $60.

 

Is There a Maximum Price?
.........................

Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept as
high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation (tax-deductible in
the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt public charity.

 

January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM
-------------------------------------------

The fourth edition of our CD-ROM that has binaries and complete sources for
GNU compiler tools for some systems which lack a compiler, will be available
at the end of January 1997.  This enables the people who use these systems to
compile GNU and other free software without having to buy a proprietary
compiler.  You can also use these GNU tools to compile your own
C/C++/Objective-C programs.  Older editions of this CD are available while
supplies last at a reduced price; see the *note Free Software Foundation
Order Form::.

We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can help
build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with a C
compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses on the
top menu.

These packages:

        * DJGPP
        * GCC/G++/Objective-C
        * GNU C Library
        * GDB
        * Binutils
        * Bison
        * Emacs (MS-DOS only)
        * Flex
        * Make
        * libg++

On these platforms:

        * `i386-msdos'
        * `hppa1.1-hp-hpux9'
        * `hppa1.1-hp-hpux10'
        * `powerpc-ibm-aix4.2'
        * `sparc-sun-solaris2.4'
        * `sparc-sun-solaris2.5'
        * `sparc-sun-sunos4.1'

 

Source Code CD-ROMs
-------------------

We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:

   * *Note January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs::, the newest release, has
     programs, bug fixes, & improvements not on the other CDs.

   * *Note July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMs::.

   * December 1995 Source Code CD-ROMs, see the *note Free Software
     Foundation Order Form::.

   * June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software Foundation
     Order Form::.

   * May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software Foundation
     Order Form::.

   * November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software Foundation
     Order Form::.

   * May 1993 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software Foundation
     Order Form::.

   * October 1992 Source Code CD-ROM, see the *note Free Software Foundation
     Order Form::.

The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced price
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in *Note
Documentation::.

MIT Scheme & much of X11 is *not* on the older Source CDs.

There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

 

January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs
................................

The 9th edition of our Source Code CD will be available at the end of January
1997 with two CD-ROM disks.  It has programs, bug fixes, & improvements not
on the older Source CDs.  It has these packages, & some manuals that are not
part of packages.  The version number of each package listed might be higher
on the 9th edition CD due to new releases being made between now and then.

CD-ROM Subscription Service
***************************

Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source CD-ROMs (plus
shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new versions of the *Note
Source Code CD-ROMs::.  The CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued (currently
twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent).  We do not yet know if
we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools Binaries CD.

A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the X
Window System.  Each edition of the *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::, has updated
sources for the X Window System.

Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping required
for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're in Alaska,
Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you
must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping
Costs" on the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.

 

FSF T-shirt
***********

The front of our T-shirt has the GNU Emacs Lisp code `(USE 'GNU)' with "`()'"
being the dancing parentheses from the cover of our `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual' (drawn by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne Suvasa).  The shirt's back has
the Preamble to the GNU General Public License.

These shirts come in black, purple, red, pink, burgundy, blue, and natural
(off-white).  When you order, please give 3 choices.  Black and purple are
printed in white; the other colors are printed in black.  All shirts are
thick 100% cotton, and come in sizes S, M, L, XL, and XXL (but they run small
so you may want a larger size than usual).

GNU T-shirts often create spontaneous friendships at conferences & on
university campuses.  They also make great gifts for friends & family,
including children!
