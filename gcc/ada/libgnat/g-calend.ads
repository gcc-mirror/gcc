--  This package extends Ada.Calendar to handle Hour, Minute, Second,
--  Second_Duration and Day_Of_Week and Day_In_Year from Calendar.Time.
--  Second_Duration precision depends on the target clock precision.
--
--  GNAT.Calendar provides the same kind of abstraction found in Ada.Calendar.
--  It provides Split and Time_Of to build and split a Time data. And it
--  provides accessor functions to get only one of Hour, Minute, Second,
--  Second_Duration. Other functions are to access more advanced values like
--  Day_Of_Week, Day_In_Year and Week_In_Year.
