   --  This function scans the string starting at Str (Ptr.all) for a valid
   --  real literal according to the syntax described in (RM 3.5(43)). The
   --  substring scanned extends no further than Str (Max). There are three
   --  cases for the return:
   --
   --  If a valid real is found after scanning past any initial spaces, then
   --  Ptr.all is updated past the last character of the real (but trailing
   --  spaces are not scanned out).
   --
   --  If no valid real is found, then Ptr.all points either to an initial
   --  non-blank character, or to Max + 1 if the field is all spaces and the
   --  exception Constraint_Error is raised.
   --
   --  If a syntactically valid real is scanned, but the value is out of
   --  range, or, in the based case, the base value is out of range or there
   --  is an out of range digit, then Ptr.all points past the real literal,
   --  and Constraint_Error is raised.
   --
   --  Note: these rules correspond to the requirements for leaving the
   --  pointer positioned in Text_Io.Get
   --
   --  Note: if Str is null, i.e. if Max is less than Ptr, then this is a
   --  special case of an all-blank string, and Ptr is unchanged, and hence
   --  is greater than Max as required in this case.
   --
   --  Note: this routine should not be called with Str'Last = Positive'Last.
   --  If this occurs Program_Error is raised with a message noting that this
   --  case is not supported. Most such cases are eliminated by the caller.

   function Value_Real (Str : String) return Num;
   --  Used in computing X'Value (Str) where X is a floating-point type or an
   --  ordinary fixed-point type. Str is the string argument of the attribute.
   --  Constraint_Error is raised if the string is malformed, or if the value
   --  out of range of Num.
