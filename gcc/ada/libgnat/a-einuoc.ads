--  This is a GNAT-specific child function of Ada.Exceptions. It provides
--  clearly missing functionality for its parent package, and most reasonably
--  would simply be an added function to that package, but this change cannot
--  be made in a conforming manner.

function Ada.Exceptions.Is_Null_Occurrence
  (X : Exception_Occurrence) return Boolean;
pragma Preelaborate (Ada.Exceptions.Is_Null_Occurrence);
--  This function yields True if X is Null_Occurrence, and False otherwise
