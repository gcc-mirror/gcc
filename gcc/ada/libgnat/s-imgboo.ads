--  Boolean'Image

--  This package provides support for ``Image`` attribute on ``Boolean``. The
--  compiler performs direct calls to this unit to implement the attribute.

is
   procedure Image_Boolean
     (V : Boolean;
      S : in out String;
      P : out Natural);
   --  Computes Boolean'Image (``V``) and stores the result in
   --  ``S`` (1 .. ``P``) setting the resulting value of ``P``. The caller
   --  guarantees that ``S`` is long enough to hold the result, and that
   --  ``S``'First is 1.
