   --  ``S`` (1 .. ``P``) setting the resulting value of ``P``. The caller
   --  guarantees that ``S`` is long enough to hold the result, and that
   --  ``S``'First is 1.
   --
   --  If ``V`` is not negative, the subprogram writes the leading blank in
   --  ``S``. It then calls *Set_Image_Long_Long_Integer*.

   --  Stores the image of ``V`` in ``S`` starting at ``S`` (``P`` + 1),
   --  ``P`` is updated to point to the last character stored. The value
   --  stored is identical to the value of Long_Long_Integer'Image (``V``)
   --  except that no leading space is stored when ``V`` is non-negative. The
   --  caller guarantees that ``S`` is long enough to hold the result. ``S``
   --  need not have a lower bound of 1.
   --
   --  If ``V`` is negative, the subprogram writes the leading '-' character,
   --  otherwise work with -``V`` (always work with negative value to avoid
   --  overflow: the largest negative number is not a special case).
   --
   --  This subprogram then uses recursion: if the value is equal or less than
   --  -10, recurse with the value divided by 10. Then add the digit for the
   --  remainder.
