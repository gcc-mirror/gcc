--  This package contains the routines for supporting the Image attribute for
--  signed integer types larger than Integer, and also for conversion
--  operations required in Text_IO.Integer_IO for such types.

--  Preconditions in this unit are meant for analysis only, not for run-time
--  checking, so that the expected exceptions are raised. This is enforced by
--  setting the corresponding assertion policy to Ignore. Postconditions and
--  contract cases should not be executed at runtime as well, in order not to
--  slow down the execution of these functions.
