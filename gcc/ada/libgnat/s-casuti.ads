--  Simple casing functions

--  This package provides simple casing functions that do not require the
--  overhead of the full casing tables found in Ada.Characters.Handling.

--  Note that all the routines in this package are available to the user
--  via GNAT.Case_Util, which imports all the entities from this package.

package System.Case_Util is

   --  Note: all the following functions handle the full Latin-1 set

   function To_Upper (A : Character) return Character;
   --  Converts A to upper case if it is a lower case letter, otherwise
   --  returns the input argument unchanged.

   procedure To_Upper (A : in out String);
   function To_Upper (A : String) return String;
   --  Folds all characters of string A to upper case

   function To_Lower (A : Character) return Character;
   --  Converts A to lower case if it is an upper case letter, otherwise
   --  returns the input argument unchanged.

   --  converted to upper case.
