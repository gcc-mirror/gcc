--  Hash table searching routines

--  This package contains two separate packages. The Simple_HTable package
--  provides a very simple abstraction that associates one element to one key
--  value and takes care of all allocations automatically using the heap. The
--  Static_HTable package provides a more complex interface that allows full
--  control over allocation.

--  This package provides a facility similar to that of GNAT.HTable, except
--  that this package declares types that can be used to define dynamic
--  instances of hash tables, while instantiations in GNAT.HTable creates a
--  single instance of the hash table.

--  Note that this interface should remain synchronized with those in
--  GNAT.HTable to keep as much coherency as possible between these two
--  related units.

   --  can be retrieved by Get_Key. Furthermore, Element provides a link that
   --  can be used by the HTable for linking elements with same hash codes:
