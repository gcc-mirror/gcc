   --  setting the resulting value of P. The caller guarantees that S
   --  is long enough to hold the result, and that S'First is 1.

      P : in out Natural);
   --  Stores the image of V in S starting at S (P + 1), P is updated to point
   --  to the last character stored. The value stored is identical to the value
   --  of Int'Image (V) except that no leading space is stored when V is
   --  non-negative. The caller guarantees that S is long enough to hold the
   --  result. S need not have a lower bound of 1.
