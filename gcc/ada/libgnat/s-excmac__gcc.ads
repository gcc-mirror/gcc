   --  doubleword aligned, and the libGCC implementation actually makes it
   --  maximally aligned (see unwind.h). See additional comments on the
   --  alignment below.

   --  There is a subtle issue with the common header alignment, since the C
   --  version is aligned on BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT, the Ada version is aligned on
   --  Standard'Maximum_Alignment, and those two values don't quite represent
   --  the same concepts and so may be decoupled someday. One typical reason
   --  is that BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT may be larger than what the underlying system
   --  allocator guarantees, and there are extra costs involved in allocating
   --  objects aligned to such factors.

   --  To deal with the potential alignment differences between the C and Ada
   --  representations, the Ada part of the whole structure is only accessed
   --  by the personality routine through accessors. Ada specific fields are
   --  thus always accessed through consistent layout, and we expect the
   --  actual alignment to always be large enough to avoid traps from the C
   --  accesses to the common header. Besides, accessors alleviate the need
   --  for a C struct whole counterpart, both painful and error-prone to
   --  maintain anyway.
