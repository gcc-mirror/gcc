--  Warning: declarations in this package are ambiguous with respect to the
--  extra declarations that can be introduced into System using Extend_System.
--  It is a good idea to avoid use clauses for this package.

package System.Storage_Elements is
   pragma Pure;
   --  Note that we take advantage of the implementation permission to make
   --  this unit Pure instead of Preelaborable; see RM 13.7.1(15). In Ada 2005,
   --  this is Pure in any case (AI-362).

   pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Always_Return, Storage_Elements);

   --  We also add the pragma Pure_Function to the operations in this package,
   --  because otherwise functions with parameters derived from Address are
   --  treated as non-pure by the back-end (see exp_ch6.adb). This is because
   --  in many cases such a parameter is used to hide read/out access to
   --  objects, and it would be unsafe to treat such functions as pure.

   type Storage_Offset is range
     -(2 ** (Integer'(Standard'Address_Size) - 1)) ..
     +(2 ** (Integer'(Standard'Address_Size) - 1)) - Long_Long_Integer'(1);
   --  Note: the reason for the Long_Long_Integer qualification here is to
   --  avoid a bogus ambiguity when this unit is analyzed in an rtsfind
   --  context.

   subtype Storage_Count is Storage_Offset range 0 .. Storage_Offset'Last;

   type Storage_Element is mod 2 ** Storage_Unit;
   for Storage_Element'Size use Storage_Unit;
