--  SPITBOL tables with vstring (unbounded string) values

--  This package provides a predefined instantiation of the table abstraction
--  for type VString (Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String). This package
--  is based on Macro-SPITBOL created by Robert Dewar.

package GNAT.Spitbol.Table_VString is new
  GNAT.Spitbol.Table (VString, Nul, To_String);
pragma Preelaborate (Table_VString);
