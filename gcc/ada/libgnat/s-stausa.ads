   --  task T is
   --     pragma Storage_Size (A_Storage_Size);
   --  end T;

   --     --  Bottom_Of_Stack'Address will be used as an approximation of
   --     --  the bottom of stack. A good practice is to avoid allocating
   --     --  other local variables on this stack, as it would degrade
   --     --  the quality of this approximation.

   --  begin
   --     Initialize_Analyzer (A,
   --                          "Task t",
   --                          A_Storage_Size,

   --                          A_Storage_Size - A_Guard,
   --                          To_Stack_Address (Bottom_Of_Stack'Address));
   --     Fill_Stack (A);

   --     Compute_Result (A);
   --     Report_Result (A);
   --  end T;

   --  Errors:
   --
   --  We are instrumenting the code to measure the stack used by the user
   --  code. This method has a number of systematic errors, but several methods
   --  can be used to evaluate or reduce those errors. Here are those errors
   --  and the strategy that we use to deal with them:

   --  Bottom offset:

   --     Description: The procedure used to fill the stack with a given
   --       pattern will itself have a stack frame. The value of the stack
   --       pointer in this procedure is, therefore, different from the value
   --       before the call to the instrumentation procedure.

   --     Strategy: The user of this package should measure the bottom of stack
   --       before the call to Fill_Stack and pass it in parameter. The impact
   --       is very minor unless the stack used is very small, but in this case
   --       you aren't very interested by the figure.

   --  Instrumentation threshold at writing:

   --     Description: The procedure used to fill the stack with a given
   --       pattern will itself have a stack frame.  Therefore, it will
   --       fill the stack after this stack frame. This part of the stack will
   --       appear as used in the final measure.

   --     Strategy: As the user passes the value of the bottom of stack to
   --       the instrumentation to deal with the bottom offset error, and as
   --       the instrumentation procedure knows where the pattern filling start
   --       on the stack, the difference between the two values is the minimum
   --       stack usage that the method can measure. If, when the results are
   --       computed, the pattern zone has been left untouched, we conclude
   --       that the stack usage is inferior to this minimum stack usage.

   --  Instrumentation threshold at reading:

   --    Description: The procedure used to read the stack at the end of the
   --      execution clobbers the stack by allocating its stack frame. If this
   --      stack frame is bigger than the total stack used by the user code at
   --      this point, it will increase the measured stack size.

   --    Strategy: We could augment this stack frame and see if it changes the
   --      measure. However, this error should be negligible.

   --   Pattern zone overflow:

   --     Description: The stack grows outer than the topmost bound of the
   --       pattern zone. In that case, the topmost region modified in the
   --       pattern is not the maximum value of the stack pointer during the
   --       execution.

   --     Strategy: At the end of the execution, the difference between the
   --       topmost memory region modified in the pattern zone and the
   --       topmost bound of the pattern zone can be understood as the
   --       biggest allocation that the method could have detect, provided
   --       that there is no "Untouched allocated zone" error and no "Pattern
   --       usage in user code" error. If no object in the user code is likely
   --       to have this size, this is not likely to happen.

   --   Pattern usage in user code:

   --     Description: The pattern can be found in the object of the user code.
   --       Therefore, the address space where this object has been allocated
   --       will appear as untouched.

   --     Strategy: Choose a pattern that is uncommon. 16#0000_0000# is the
   --       worst choice; 16#DEAD_BEEF# can be a good one. A good choice is an
   --       address which is not a multiple of 2, and which is not in the
   --       target address space. You can also change the pattern to see if it
   --       changes the measure. Note that this error *very* rarely influence
   --       the measure of the total stack usage: to have some influence, the
   --       pattern has to be used in the object that has been allocated on the
   --       topmost address of the used stack.

   --   Stack overflow:

   --     Description: The pattern zone does not fit on the stack. This may
   --       lead to an erroneous execution.

   --     Strategy: Specify a storage size that is bigger than the size of the
   --       pattern. 2 times bigger should be enough.

   --   Augmentation of the user stack frames:

   --     Description: The use of instrumentation object or procedure may
   --       augment the stack frame of the caller.

   --     Strategy: Do *not* inline the instrumentation procedures. Do *not*
   --       allocate the Stack_Analyzer object on the stack.

   --   Untouched allocated zone:

   --     Description: The user code may allocate objects that it will never
   --       touch. In that case, the pattern will not be changed.

   --     Strategy: There are no way to detect this error. Fortunately, this
   --       error is really rare, and it is most probably a bug in the user
   --       code, e.g. some uninitialized variable. It is (most of the time)
   --       harmless: it influences the measure only if the untouched allocated
   --       zone happens to be located at the topmost value of the stack
   --       pointer for the whole execution.
