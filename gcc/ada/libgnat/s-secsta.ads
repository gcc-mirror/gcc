   -- Introduction --
   ------------------

   --  The secondary stack is a runtime data structure managed in a stack-like
   --  fashion. It is part of the runtime support for functions that return
   --  results of caller-unknown size.
   --
   --  The secondary stack is utilized as follows:
   --
   --    * The compiler pushes the caller-unknown size result on the secondary
   --      stack as part of return statement or build-in-place semantics.
   --
   --    * The caller receives a reference to the result.
   --
   --    * Using the reference, the caller may "offload" the result into its
   --      primary stack, or use it in-place while still on the secondary
   --      stack.
   --
   --    * Once the caller has utilized the result, the compiler reclaims the
   --      memory occupied by the result by popping the secondary stack up to
   --      a safe limit.

   ------------
   -- Design --
   ------------

   --  1) Chunk
   --
   --  The secondary stack is a linked structure which consist of "chunks".
   --  A chunk is both a memory storage and a linked-list node. Addresses of
   --  allocated objects refer to addresses within the memory storage of a
   --  chunk. Chunks come in two variants - static and dynamic.
   --
   --  1.1) Static chunk
   --
   --  The secondary stack has exactly one static chunk that is created on the
   --  primary stack. The static chunk allows secondary-stack usage on targets
   --  where dynamic allocation is not available or desirable. The static chunk
   --  is always the "first" chunk and precedes all dynamic chunks.
   --
   --  1.2) Dynamic chunk
   --
   --  The secondary stack may have zero or more dynamic chunks, created on the
   --  heap. Dynamic chunks allow the secondary stack to grow beyond the limits
   --  of the initial static chunk. They provide a finer-grained management of
   --  the memory by means of reuse and deallocation.
   --
   --  2) Mark
   --
   --  The secondary stack captures its state in a "mark". The mark is used by
   --  the compiler to indicate how far the stack can be safely popped after a
   --  sequence of pushes has taken place.
   --
   --  3) Secondary stack
   --
   --  The secondary stack maintains a singly-linked list of chunks, starting
   --  with the static chunk, along with a stack pointer.
   --
   --  4) Allocation
   --
   --  The process of allocation equates to "pushing" on the secondary stack.
   --  Depending on whether dynamic allocation is allowed or not, there are
   --  two variants of allocation - static and dynamic.
   --
   --  4.1) Static allocation
   --
   --  In this case the secondary stack has only the static chunk to work with.
   --  The requested size is reserved on the static chunk and the stack pointer
   --  is advanced. If the requested size will overflow the static chunk, then
   --  Storage_Error is raised.
   --
   --  4.2) Dynamic allocation
   --
   --  In this case the secondary stack may carry out several actions depending
   --  on how much free memory is available in the chunk indicated by the stack
   --  pointer.
   --
   --    * If the indicated chunk is big enough, allocation is carried out on
   --      it.
   --
   --    * If the indicated chunk is too small, subsequent chunks (if any) are
   --      examined. If a subsequent chunk is big enough, allocation is carried
   --      out on it, otherwise the subsequent chunk is deallocated.
   --
   --    * If none of the chunks following and including the indicated chunk
   --      are big enough, a new chunk is created and the allocation is carried
   --      out on it.
   --
   --  This model of operation has several desirable effects:
   --
   --    * Leftover chunks from prior allocations, followed by at least one pop
   --      are either reused or deallocated. This compacts the memory footprint
   --      of the secondary stack.
   --
   --    * When a new chunk is created, its size is exactly the requested size.
   --      This keeps the memory usage of the secondary stack tight.
   --
   --    * Allocation is in general an expensive operation. Compaction is thus
   --      added to this cost, rather than penalizing mark and pop operations.
   --
   --  5) Marking
   --
   --  The process of marking involves capturing the secondary-stack pointer
   --  in a mark for later restore.
   --
   --  6) Releasing
   --
   --  The process of releasing equates to "popping" the secondary stack. It
   --  moves the stack pointer to a previously captured mark, causing chunks
   --  to become reusable or deallocatable during the allocation process.
