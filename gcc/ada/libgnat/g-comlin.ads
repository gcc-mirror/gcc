--  High level package for command line parsing and manipulation

----------------------------------------
-- Simple Parsing of the Command Line --
----------------------------------------

--  This package provides an interface for parsing command line arguments,
--  when they are either read from Ada.Command_Line or read from a string list.
--  As shown in the example below, one should first retrieve the switches
--  (special command line arguments starting with '-' by default) and their
--  parameters, and then the rest of the command line arguments.
--
--  While it may appear easy to parse the command line arguments with
--  Ada.Command_Line, there are in fact lots of special cases to handle in some
--  applications. Those are fully managed by GNAT.Command_Line. Among these are
--  switches with optional parameters, grouping switches (for instance "-ab"
--  might mean the same as "-a -b"), various characters to separate a switch
--  and its parameter (or none: "-a 1" and "-a1" are generally the same, which
--  can introduce confusion with grouped switches),...
--
--  begin
--     loop
--        case Getopt ("a b: ad") is  -- Accepts '-a', '-ad', or '-b argument'
--           when ASCII.NUL => exit;

--           when 'a' =>
--                 if Full_Switch = "a" then
--                    Put_Line ("Got a");
--                 else
--                    Put_Line ("Got ad");
--                 end if;

--           when 'b' => Put_Line ("Got b + " & Parameter);

--           when others =>
--              raise Program_Error; -- cannot occur
--        end case;
--     end loop;

--     loop
--        declare
--           S : constant String := Get_Argument (Do_Expansion => True);
--        begin
--           exit when S'Length = 0;
--           Put_Line ("Got " & S);
--        end;
--     end loop;

--  exception
--     when Invalid_Switch    => Put_Line ("Invalid Switch " & Full_Switch);
--     when Invalid_Parameter => Put_Line ("No parameter for " & Full_Switch);
--  end;

--------------
-- Sections --
--------------

--  A more complicated example would involve the use of sections for the
--  switches, as for instance in gnatmake. The same command line is used to
--  provide switches for several tools. Each tool recognizes its switches by
--  separating them with special switches that act as section separators.
--  Each section acts as a command line of its own.

--  begin
--     Initialize_Option_Scan ('-', False, "largs bargs cargs");
--     loop
--        --  Same loop as above to get switches and arguments
--     end loop;

--     Goto_Section ("bargs");
--     loop
--        --  Same loop as above to get switches and arguments
--        --  The supported switches in Getopt might be different
--     end loop;

--     Goto_Section ("cargs");
--     loop
--        --  Same loop as above to get switches and arguments
--        --  The supported switches in Getopt might be different
--     end loop;
--  end;

-------------------------------
-- Parsing a List of Strings --
-------------------------------

--  The examples above show how to parse the command line when the arguments
--  are read directly from Ada.Command_Line. However, these arguments can also
--  be read from a list of strings. This can be useful in several contexts,
--  either because your system does not support Ada.Command_Line, or because
--  you are manipulating other tools and creating their command lines by hand,
--  or for any other reason.

--  To create the list of strings, it is recommended to use
--  GNAT.OS_Lib.Argument_String_To_List.

--  The example below shows how to get the parameters from such a list. Note
--  also the use of '*' to get all the switches, and not report errors when an
--  unexpected switch was used by the user

--  declare
--     Parser : Opt_Parser;
--     Args : constant Argument_List_Access :=
--        GNAT.OS_Lib.Argument_String_To_List ("-g -O1 -Ipath");
--  begin
--     Initialize_Option_Scan (Parser, Args);
--     while Getopt ("* g O! I=", Parser) /= ASCII.NUL loop
--        Put_Line ("Switch " & Full_Switch (Parser)
--                  & " param=" & Parameter (Parser));
--     end loop;
--     Free (Parser);
--  end;

-------------------------------------------
-- High-Level Command Line Configuration --
-------------------------------------------

--  As shown above, the code is still relatively low-level. For instance, there
--  is no way to indicate which switches are related (thus if "-l" and "--long"
--  should have the same effect, your code will need to test for both cases).
--  Likewise, it is difficult to handle more advanced constructs, like:

--    * Specifying -gnatwa is the same as specifying -gnatwu -gnatwv, but
--      shorter and more readable

--    * All switches starting with -gnatw can be grouped, for instance one
--      can write -gnatwcd instead of -gnatwc -gnatwd.
--      Of course, this can be combined with the above and -gnatwacd is the
--      same as -gnatwc -gnatwd -gnatwu -gnatwv

--    * The switch -T is the same as -gnatwAB (same as -gnatwA -gnatwB)

--  With the above form of Getopt, you would receive "-gnatwa", "-T" or
--  "-gnatwcd" in the examples above, and thus you require additional manual
--  parsing of the switch.

--  Instead, this package provides the type Command_Line_Configuration, which
--  stores all the knowledge above. For instance:

--     Config : Command_Line_Configuration;
--     Define_Alias  (Config, "-gnatwa", "-gnatwu -gnatwv");
--     Define_Prefix (Config, "-gnatw");
--     Define_Alias  (Config, "-T",      "-gnatwAB");

--  You then need to specify all possible switches in your application by
--  calling Define_Switch, for instance:

--     Define_Switch (Config, "-gnatwu", Help => "warn on unused entities");
--     Define_Switch (Config, "-gnatwv", Help => "warn on unassigned var");
--     ...

--  Specifying the help message is optional, but makes it easy to then call
--  the function:

--     Display_Help (Config);

--  that will display a properly formatted help message for your application,
--  listing all possible switches. That way you have a single place in which
--  to maintain the list of switches and their meaning, rather than maintaining
--  both the string to pass to Getopt and a subprogram to display the help.
--  Both will properly stay synchronized.

--  Once you have this Config, you just have to call:

--     Getopt (Config, Callback'Access);

--  to parse the command line. The Callback will be called for each switch
--  found on the command line (in the case of our example, that is "-gnatwu"
--  and then "-gnatwv", not "-gnatwa" itself). This simplifies command line
--  parsing a lot.

--  In fact, this can be further automated for the most command case where the
--  parameter passed to a switch is stored in a variable in the application.
--  When a switch is defined, you only have to indicate where to store the
--  value, and let Getopt do the rest. For instance:

--     Optimization : aliased Integer;
--     Verbose      : aliased Boolean;

--     Define_Switch (Config, Verbose'Access,
--                    "-v", Long_Switch => "--verbose",
--                    Help => "Output extra verbose information");
--     Define_Switch (Config, Optimization'Access,
--                    "-O?", Help => "Optimization level");

--     Getopt (Config);  --  No callback

--  Since all switches are handled automatically, we don't even need to pass
--  a callback to Getopt. Once getopt has been called, the two variables
--  Optimization and Verbose have been properly initialized, either to the
--  default value or to the value found on the command line.

------------------------------------------------
-- Creating and Manipulating the Command Line --
------------------------------------------------

--  This package provides mechanisms to create and modify command lines by
--  adding or removing arguments from them. The resulting command line is kept
--  as short as possible by coalescing arguments whenever possible.

--  Complex command lines can thus be constructed, for example from a GUI
--  (although this package does not by itself depend upon any specific GUI
--  toolkit).

--  Using the configuration defined earlier, one can then construct a command
--  line for the tool with:

--     Cmd : Command_Line;
--     Set_Configuration (Cmd, Config);   --  Config created earlier
--     Add_Switch (Cmd, "-bar");
--     Add_Switch (Cmd, "-gnatwu");
--     Add_Switch (Cmd, "-gnatwv");  --  will be grouped with the above
--     Add_Switch (Cmd, "-T");

--  The resulting command line can be iterated over to get all its switches,
--  There are two modes for this iteration: either you want to get the
--  shortest possible command line, which would be:

--      -bar -gnatwaAB

--  or on the other hand you want each individual switch (so that your own
--  tool does not have to do further complex processing), which would be:

--      -bar -gnatwu -gnatwv -gnatwA -gnatwB

--  Of course, we can assume that the tool you want to spawn would understand
--  both of these, since they are both compatible with the description we gave
--  above. However, the first result is useful if you want to show the user
--  what you are spawning (since that keeps the output shorter), and the second
--  output is more useful for a tool that would check whether -gnatwu was
--  passed (which isn't obvious in the first output). Likewise, the second
--  output is more useful if you have a graphical interface since each switch
--  can be associated with a widget, and you immediately know whether -gnatwu
--  was selected.
--
--  Some command line arguments can have parameters, which on a command line
--  appear as a separate argument that must immediately follow the switch.
--  Since the subprograms in this package will reorganize the switches to group
--  them, you need to indicate what is a command line parameter, and what is a
--  switch argument.

--  This is done by passing an extra argument to Add_Switch, as in:

--     Add_Switch (Cmd, "-foo", Parameter => "arg1");

--  This ensures that "arg1" will always be treated as the argument to -foo,
--  and will not be grouped with other parts of the command line.

   -- Parsing --
   -------------

   type Opt_Parser is private;
   Command_Line_Parser : constant Opt_Parser;
   --  This object is responsible for parsing a list of arguments, which by
   --  default are the standard command line arguments from Ada.Command_Line.
   --  This is really a pointer to actual data, which must therefore be
   --  initialized through a call to Initialize_Option_Scan, and must be freed
   --  with a call to Free.
   --
   --  As a special case, Command_Line_Parser does not need to be either
   --  initialized or free-ed.

   procedure Initialize_Option_Scan
     (Switch_Char              : Character := '-';
      Stop_At_First_Non_Switch : Boolean := False;
      Section_Delimiters       : String := "");
   procedure Initialize_Option_Scan
     (Parser                   : out Opt_Parser;
      Command_Line             : GNAT.OS_Lib.Argument_List_Access;
      Switch_Char              : Character := '-';
      Stop_At_First_Non_Switch : Boolean := False;
      Section_Delimiters       : String := "");
   --  The first procedure resets the internal state of the package to prepare
   --  to rescan the parameters. It does not need to be called before the
   --  first use of Getopt (but it could be), but it must be called if you
   --  want to start rescanning the command line parameters from the start.
   --  The optional parameter Switch_Char can be used to reset the switch
   --  character, e.g. to '/' for use in DOS-like systems.
   --
   --  The second subprogram initializes a parser that takes its arguments
   --  from an array of strings rather than directly from the command line. In
   --  this case, the parser is responsible for freeing the strings stored in
   --  Command_Line. If you pass null to Command_Line, this will in fact create
   --  a second parser for Ada.Command_Line, which doesn't share any data with
   --  the default parser. This parser must be free'ed.
   --
   --  The optional parameter Stop_At_First_Non_Switch indicates if Getopt is
   --  to look for switches on the whole command line, or if it has to stop as
   --  soon as a non-switch argument is found.
   --
   --  Example:
   --
   --      Arguments: my_application file1 -c
   --
   --      If Stop_At_First_Non_Switch is False, then -c will be considered
   --      as a switch (returned by getopt), otherwise it will be considered
   --      as a normal argument (returned by Get_Argument).
   --
   --  If Section_Delimiters is set, then every following subprogram
   --  (Getopt and Get_Argument) will only operate within a section, which
   --  is delimited by any of these delimiters or the end of the command line.
   --
   --  Example:
   --      Initialize_Option_Scan (Section_Delimiters => "largs bargs cargs");
   --
   --      Arguments on command line : my_application -c -bargs -d -e -largs -f
   --      This line contains three sections, the first one is the default one
   --      and includes only the '-c' switch, the second one is between -bargs
   --      and -largs and includes '-d -e' and the last one includes '-f'.

   procedure Free (Parser : in out Opt_Parser);
   --  Free the memory used by the parser. Calling this is not mandatory for
   --  the Command_Line_Parser

   procedure Goto_Section
     (Name   : String := "";
      Parser : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser);
   --  Change the current section. The next Getopt or Get_Argument will start
   --  looking at the beginning of the section. An empty name ("") refers to
   --  the first section between the program name and the first section
   --  delimiter. If the section does not exist in Section_Delimiters, then
   --  Invalid_Section is raised. If the section does not appear on the command
   --  line, then it is treated as an empty section.

   function Full_Switch
     (Parser : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser) return String;
   --  Returns the full name of the last switch found (Getopt only returns the
   --  first character). Does not include the Switch_Char ('-' by default),
   --  unless the "*" option of Getopt is used (see below).

   function Current_Section
     (Parser : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser) return String;
   --  Return the name of the current section.
   --  The list of valid sections is defined through Initialize_Option_Scan

   function Getopt
     (Switches    : String;
      Concatenate : Boolean := True;
      Parser      : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser) return Character;
   --  This function moves to the next switch on the command line (defined as
   --  switch character followed by a character within Switches, casing being
   --  significant). The result returned is the first character of the switch
   --  that is located. If there are no more switches in the current section,
   --  returns ASCII.NUL. If Concatenate is True (the default), the switches do
   --  not need to be separated by spaces (they can be concatenated if they do
   --  not require an argument, e.g. -ab is the same as two separate arguments
   --  -a -b).
   --
   --  Switches is a string of all the possible switches, separated by
   --  spaces. A switch can be followed by one of the following characters:
   --
   --   ':'  The switch requires a parameter. There can optionally be a space
   --        on the command line between the switch and its parameter.
   --
   --   '='  The switch requires a parameter. There can either be a '=' or a
   --        space on the command line between the switch and its parameter.
   --
   --   '!'  The switch requires a parameter, but there can be no space on the
   --        command line between the switch and its parameter.
   --
   --   '?'  The switch may have an optional parameter. There can be no space
   --        between the switch and its argument.
   --
   --        e.g. if Switches has the following value : "a? b",
   --        The command line can be:
   --
   --             -afoo    :  -a switch with 'foo' parameter
   --             -a foo   :  -a switch and another element on the
   --                           command line 'foo', returned by Get_Argument
   --
   --     Example: if Switches is "-a: -aO:", you can have the following
   --              command lines:
   --
   --                -aarg    :  'a' switch with 'arg' parameter
   --                -a arg   :  'a' switch with 'arg' parameter
   --                -aOarg   :  'aO' switch with 'arg' parameter
   --                -aO arg  :  'aO' switch with 'arg' parameter
   --
   --    Example:
   --
   --       Getopt ("a b: ac ad?")
   --
   --         accept either 'a' or 'ac' with no argument,
   --         accept 'b' with a required argument
   --         accept 'ad' with an optional argument
   --
   --  If the first item in switches is '*', then Getopt will catch
   --  every element on the command line that was not caught by any other
   --  switch. The character returned by GetOpt is '*', but Full_Switch
   --  contains the full command line argument, including leading '-' if there
   --  is one. If this character was not returned, there would be no way of
   --  knowing whether it is there or not.
   --
   --    Example
   --       Getopt ("* a b")
   --       If the command line is '-a -c toto.o -b', Getopt will return
   --       successively 'a', '*', '*' and 'b', with Full_Switch returning
   --       "a", "-c", "toto.o", and "b".
   --
   --  When Getopt encounters an invalid switch, it raises the exception
   --  Invalid_Switch and sets Full_Switch to return the invalid switch.
   --  When Getopt cannot find the parameter associated with a switch, it
   --  raises Invalid_Parameter, and sets Full_Switch to return the invalid
   --  switch.
   --
   --  Note: in case of ambiguity, e.g. switches a ab abc, then the longest
   --  matching switch is returned.
   --
   --  Arbitrary characters are allowed for switches, although it is
   --  strongly recommended to use only letters and digits for portability
   --  reasons.
   --
   --  When Concatenate is False, individual switches need to be separated by
   --  spaces.
   --
   --    Example
   --      Getopt ("a b", Concatenate => False)
   --      If the command line is '-ab', exception Invalid_Switch will be
   --      raised and Full_Switch will return "ab".

   function Get_Argument
     (Do_Expansion : Boolean := False;
      Parser       : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser) return String;
   --  Returns the next element on the command line that is not a switch.  This
   --  function should not be called before Getopt has returned ASCII.NUL.
   --
   --  If Do_Expansion is True, then the parameter on the command line will
   --  be considered as a filename with wild cards, and will be expanded. The
   --  matching file names will be returned one at a time. This is useful in
   --  non-Unix systems for obtaining normal expansion of wild card references.
   --  When there are no more arguments on the command line, this function
   --  returns an empty string.

   function Parameter
     (Parser : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser) return String;
   --  Returns parameter associated with the last switch returned by Getopt.
   --  If no parameter was associated with the last switch, or no previous call
   --  has been made to Get_Argument, raises Invalid_Parameter. If the last
   --  switch was associated with an optional argument and this argument was
   --  not found on the command line, Parameter returns an empty string.

   function Separator
     (Parser : Opt_Parser := Command_Line_Parser) return Character;
   --  The separator that was between the switch and its parameter. This is
   --  useful if you want to know exactly what was on the command line. This
   --  is in general a single character, set to ASCII.NUL if the switch and
   --  the parameter were concatenated. A space is returned if the switch and
   --  its argument were in two separate arguments.

   Invalid_Section : exception;
   --  Raised when an invalid section is selected by Goto_Section

   Invalid_Switch : exception;
   --  Raised when an invalid switch is detected in the command line

   Invalid_Parameter : exception;
   --  Raised when a parameter is missing, or an attempt is made to obtain a
   --  parameter for a switch that does not allow a parameter.

   -- Expansion of command line arguments --

   --  The list of valid switches are the ones from the configuration. The
   --  switches that were declared through Define_Switch with an Output
   --  parameter are never returned (and result in a modification of the Output
   --  variable). This function will in fact never call [Callback] if all
   --  switches were handled automatically and there is nothing left to do.
   --
   --  The option Concatenate is identical to the one of the standard Getopt
   --  function.
   --
   --  This procedure automatically adds -h and --help to the valid switches,
   --  to display the help message and raises Exit_From_Command_Line.
   --  If an invalid switch is specified on the command line, this procedure
   --  will display an error message and raises Invalid_Switch again.
   --
   --  This function automatically expands switches:
   --
   --    If Define_Prefix was called (for instance "-gnaty") and the user
   --    specifies "-gnatycb" on the command line, then Getopt returns
   --    "-gnatyc" and "-gnatyb" separately.
   --
   --    If Define_Alias was called (for instance "-gnatya = -gnatycb") then
   --    the latter is returned (in this case it also expands -gnaty as per
   --    the above.
   --
   --  The goal is to make handling as easy as possible by leaving as much
   --  work as possible to this package.
   --
   --  As opposed to the standard Getopt, this one will analyze all sections
   --  as defined by Define_Section, and automatically jump from one section to
   --  the next.

   -- Generating command lines --
   ------------------------------

   --  Once the command line configuration has been created, you can build your
   --  own command line. This will be done in general because you need to spawn
   --  external tools from your application.

   --  Although it could be done by concatenating strings, the following
   --  subprograms will properly take care of grouping switches when possible,
   --  so as to keep the command line as short as possible. They also provide a
   --  way to remove a switch from an existing command line.

   --  For instance:

   --      declare
   --         Config : Command_Line_Configuration;
   --         Line : Command_Line;
   --         Args : Argument_List_Access;

   --         Define_Prefix (Config, "-gnaty");

   --         Add_Switch (Line, "-O2");
   --         Add_Switch (Line, "-gnatyc");
   --         Add_Switch (Line, "-gnatyd");
   --
   --         Build (Line, Args);
   --         --   Args is now  ["-O2", "-gnatycd"]
   --      end;

   type Command_Line is private;

   procedure Set_Configuration

      Config : Command_Line_Configuration);
   function Get_Configuration
     (Cmd : Command_Line) return Command_Line_Configuration;
   --  Set or retrieve the configuration used for that command line. The Config
   --  must have been initialized first, by calling one of the Define_Switches
   --  subprograms.

      Switches           : String;

      Switch_Char        : Character := '-');
   --  Set the new content of the command line, by replacing the current
   --  version with Switches.
   --
   --  The parsing of Switches is done through calls to Getopt, by passing
   --  Getopt_Description as an argument. (A "*" is automatically prepended so
   --  that all switches and command line arguments are accepted). If a config
   --  was defined via Set_Configuration, the Getopt_Description parameter will
   --  be ignored.
   --
   --  To properly handle switches that take parameters, you should document
   --  them in Getopt_Description. Otherwise, the switch and its parameter will
   --  be recorded as two separate command line arguments as returned by a
   --  Command_Line_Iterator (which might be fine depending on your
   --  application).
   --
   --  If the command line has sections (such as -bargs -cargs), then they
   --  should be listed in the Sections parameter (as "-bargs -cargs").
   --
   --  This function can be used to reset Cmd by passing an empty string
   --
   --  If an invalid switch is found on the command line (i.e. wasn't defined
   --  in the configuration via Define_Switch), and the configuration wasn't
   --  set to accept all switches (by defining "*" as a valid switch), then an
   --  exception Invalid_Switch is raised. The exception message indicates the
   --  invalid switch.

   --  Add a new switch to the command line, and combine/group it with existing
   --  switches if possible. Nothing is done if the switch already exists with
   --  the same parameter.
   --
   --  If the Switch takes a parameter, the latter should be specified
   --  separately, so that the association between the two is always correctly
   --  recognized even if the order of switches on the command line changes.
   --  For instance, you should pass "--check=full" as ("--check", "full") so
   --  that Remove_Switch below can simply take "--check" in parameter. That
   --  will automatically remove "full" as well. The value of the parameter is
   --  never modified by this package.
   --
   --  On the other hand, you could decide to simply pass "--check=full" as
   --  the Switch above, and then pass no parameter. This means that you need
   --  to pass "--check=full" to Remove_Switch as well.
   --
   --  A Switch with a parameter will never be grouped with another switch to
   --  avoid ambiguities as to what the parameter applies to.
   --
   --  If the switch is part of a section, then it should be specified so that
   --  the switch is correctly placed in the command line, and the section
   --  added if not already present. For example, to add the -g switch into the
   --  -cargs section, you need to call (Cmd, "-g", Section => "-cargs").
   --
   --  [Separator], if specified, overrides the separator that was defined
   --  through Define_Switch. For instance, if the switch was defined as
   --  "-from:", the separator defaults to a space. But if your application
   --  uses unusual separators not supported by GNAT.Command_Line (for instance
   --  it requires ":"), you can specify this separator here.
   --
   --  For instance,
   --     Add_Switch(Cmd, "-from", "bar", ':')
   --
   --  results in
   --     -from:bar
   --
   --  rather than the default
   --     -from bar
   --
   --  Note however that Getopt doesn't know how to handle ":" as a separator.
   --  So the recommendation is to declare the switch as "-from!" (i.e. no
   --  space between the switch and its parameter). Then Getopt will return
   --  ":bar" as the parameter, and you can trim the ":" in your application.
   --
   --  Invalid_Section is raised if Section was not defined in the
   --  configuration of the command line.
   --
   --  Add_Before allows insertion of the switch at the beginning of the
   --  command line.
