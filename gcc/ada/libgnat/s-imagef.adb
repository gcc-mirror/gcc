   --  The following section describes a specific implementation choice for
   --  performing base conversions needed for output of values of a fixed
   --  point type T with small T'Small. The goal is to be able to output
   --  all values of fixed point types with a precision of 64 bits and a
   --  small in the range 2.0**(-63) .. 2.0**63. The reasoning can easily
   --  be adapted to fixed point types with a precision of 32 or 128 bits.

   --  The chosen algorithm uses fixed precision integer arithmetic for
   --  reasons of simplicity and efficiency. It is important to understand
   --  in what ways the most simple and accurate approach to fixed point I/O
   --  is limiting, before considering more complicated schemes.

   --  Without loss of generality assume T has a range (-2.0**63) * T'Small
   --  .. (2.0**63 - 1) * T'Small, and is output with Aft digits after the
   --  decimal point and T'Fore - 1 before. If T'Small is integer, or
   --  1.0 / T'Small is integer, let S = T'Small.

   --  The idea is to convert a value X * S of type T to a 64-bit integer value
   --  Q equal to 10.0**D * (X * S) rounded to the nearest integer, using only
   --  a scaled integer divide of the form

   --     Q = (X * Y) / Z,

   --  where the variables X, Y, Z are 64-bit integers, and both multiplication
   --  and division are done using full intermediate precision. Then the final
   --  decimal value to be output is

   --     Q * 10**(-D)

   --  This value can be written to the output file or to the result string
   --  according to the format described in RM A.3.10. The details of this
   --  operation are omitted here.

   --  A 64-bit value can represent all integers with 18 decimal digits, but
   --  not all with 19 decimal digits. If the total number of requested output
   --  digits (Fore - 1) + Aft is greater than 18 then, for purposes of the
   --  conversion, Aft is adjusted to 18 - (Fore - 1). In that case, trailing
   --  zeros can complete the output after writing the first 18 significant
   --  digits, or the technique described in the next section can be used.
   --  In addition, D cannot be smaller than -18, in order for 10.0**(-D) to
   --  fit in a 64-bit integer.

   --  The final expression for D is

   --     D = Integer'Max (-18, Integer'Min (Aft, 18 - (Fore - 1)));

   --  For Y and Z the following expressions can be derived:

   --     Q = X * S * (10.0**D) = (X * Y) / Z

   --  If S is an integer greater than or equal to one, then Fore must be at
   --  least 20 in order to print T'First, which is at most -2.0**63. This
   --  means that D < 0, so use

   --    (1)   Y = -S and Z = -10**(-D)

   --  If 1.0 / S is an integer greater than one, use

   --    (2)   Y = -10**D and Z = -(1.0 / S), for D >= 0

   --  or

   --    (3)   Y = -1 and Z = -(1.0 / S) * 10**(-D), for D < 0

   --  Negative values are used for nominator Y and denominator Z, so that S
   --  can have a maximum value of 2.0**63 and a minimum of 2.0**(-63). For
   --  -(1.0 / S) in -1 .. -9, Fore will still be 20, and D will be negative,
   --  as (-2.0**63) / -9 is greater than 10**18. In these cases there is room
   --  in the denominator for the extra decimal scaling required, so case (3)
   --  will not overflow.

   --  In fact this reasoning can be generalized to most S which are the ratio
   --  of two integers with bounded magnitude. Let S = Num / Den and rewrite
   --  case (1) above where Den = 1 into

   --    (1b)   Y = -Num and Z = -Den * 10**(-D)

   --  Suppose that Num corresponds to the maximum value of -D, i.e. 18 and
   --  10**(-D) = 10**18. If you change Den into 10, then S becomes 10 times
   --  smaller and, therefore, Fore is decremented by 1, which means that -D
   --  is as well, provided that Fore was initially not larger than 37, so the
   --  multiplication for Z still does not overflow. But you need to reach 10
   --  to trigger this effect, which means that a leeway of 10 is required, so
   --  let's restrict this to a Num for which 10**(-D) <= 10**17. To summarize
   --  this case, if S is the ratio of two integers with

   --    Den < Num <= B1

   --  where B1 is a fixed limit, then case (1b) does not overflow. B1 can be
   --  taken as the largest integer Small such that D = -17, i.e. Fore = 36,
   --  which means that B1 * 2.0**63 must be smaller than 10**35.

   --  Let's continue and rewrite case (2) above when Num = 1 into

   --    (2b)   Y = -Num * 10**D and Z = -Den, for D >= 0

   --  Note that D <= 18 - (Fore - 1) and Fore >= 2 so D <= 17, thus you can
   --  safely change Num into 10 in the product, but then S becomes 10 times
   --  larger and, therefore, Fore is incremented by 1, which means that D is
   --  decremented by 1 so you again have a product lesser or equal to 10**17.
   --  To sum up, if S is the ratio of two integers with

   --    Num <= Den * S0

   --  where S0 is the largest Small such that D >= 0, then case (2b) does not
   --  overflow.

   --  Let's conclude and rewrite case (3) above when Num = 1 into

   --    (3b)   Y = -Num and Z = -Den * 10**(-D), for D < 0

   --  As explained above, this occurs only if both S0 < S < 1 and D = -1 and
   --  is preserved if you scale up Num and Den simultaneously, what you can
   --  do until Den * 10 tops the upper bound. To sum up, if S is the ratio of
   --  two integers with

   --    Den * S0 < Num < Den <= B2

   --  where B2 is a fixed limit, then case (3b) does not overflow. B2 can be
   --  taken as the largest integer such that B2 * 10 is smaller than 2.0**63.

   --  The conclusion is that the algorithm works if the small is the ratio of
   --  two integers in the range 1 .. 2**63 if either is equal to 1, or of two
   --  integers in the range 1 .. B1 if the small is larger than 1, or of two
   --  integers in the range 1 .. B2 if the small is smaller than 1.

   --  Using a scaled divide which truncates and returns a remainder R,
   --  another K trailing digits can be calculated by computing the value
   --  (R * (10.0**K)) / Z using another scaled divide. This procedure
   --  can be repeated to compute an arbitrary number of digits in linear
   --  time and storage. The last scaled divide should be rounded, with
   --  a possible carry propagating to the more significant digits, to
   --  ensure correct rounding of the unit in the last place.
