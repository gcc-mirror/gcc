--  Operating system interface facilities

--  This package contains types and procedures for interfacing to the
--  underlying OS. It is used by the GNAT compiler and by tools associated
--  with the GNAT compiler, and therefore works for the various operating
--  systems to which GNAT has been ported. This package will undoubtedly grow
--  as new services are needed by various tools.

--  This package tends to use fairly low-level Ada in order to not bring in
--  large portions of the RTL. For example, functions return access to string
--  as part of avoiding functions returning unconstrained types.

--  Except where specifically noted, these routines are portable across all
--  GNAT implementations on all supported operating systems.

--  Note: this package is in the System hierarchy so that it can be directly
--  be used by other predefined packages. User access to this package is via
--  a renaming of this package in GNAT.OS_Lib (file g-os_lib.ads).

   --  the normalized name of the file, containing no "." or ".." components,
   --  and no duplicated directory separators. For most cases, if two file
   --  names designate the same file through different paths,
   --  Normalize_Pathname will return the same canonical name in both cases.
   --  However, there are cases when this is not true; for example, this is
   --  not true in Unix for two hard links designating the same file.
   --
   --  On Windows, the returned path will start with a drive letter. If

   --  absolute path without drive letter, the letter of the current drive
   --  will start the returned path. If Case_Sensitive is True (the default),
   --  then this drive letter will be forced to upper case ("C:\...").
   --
   --  If Resolve_Links is set to True, then the symbolic links, on systems
   --  that support them, will be fully converted to the name of the file or
   --  directory pointed to. This is slightly less efficient, since it
   --  requires system calls.
   --
   --  If Name is empty or the path contains symbolic links that can't be
   --  resolved (for example there is a symbolic link circularity,
   --  e.g. A is a symbolic link for B, and B is a symbolic link for A), then
   --  Normalize_Pathname returns an empty string.
   --
   --  For case-sensitive file systems, the value of Case_Sensitive parameter
   --  is ignored. For file systems that are not case-sensitive, such as
   --  Windows, if this parameter is set to False, then the file and directory

   --  are the same by applying this function to their names and comparing the

   -- NOTE: Spawn in Tasking Programs --
   -------------------------------------

   --  Spawning processes in tasking programs using the above Spawn and
   --  Non_Blocking_Spawn subprograms is not recommended, because there are
   --  subtle interactions between creating a process and signals/locks that
   --  can cause trouble. These issues are not specific to Ada; they depend
   --  primarily on the operating system.

   --  If you need to spawn processes in a tasking program, you will need to
   --  understand the semantics of your operating system, and you are likely to
   --  write non-portable code, because operating systems differ in this area.

   --  The Spawn and Non_Blocking_Spawn subprograms call the following
   --  operating system functions:

   --     On Windows: spawnvp (blocking) or CreateProcess (non-blocking)

   --     On Solaris: fork1, followed in the child process by execv

   --     On other Unix-like systems: fork, followed in the child
   --     process by execv.

   --     On vxworks, spawning of processes is not supported

   --  For details, look at the functions __gnat_portable_spawn and
   --  __gnat_portable_no_block_spawn in adaint.c.

   --  You should read the operating-system-specific documentation for the
   --  above functions, paying special attention to subtle interactions with
   --  threading, signals, locks, and file descriptors. Most of the issues are
   --  related to the fact that on Unix, there is a window of time between fork
   --  and execv; Windows does not have this problem, because spawning is done
   --  in a single operation.

   --  On Posix-compliant systems, such as Linux, fork duplicates just the
   --  calling thread. (On Solaris, fork1 is the Posix-compliant version of
   --  fork.)

   --  You should avoid using signals while spawning. This includes signals
   --  used internally by the Ada run-time system, such as timer signals used
   --  to implement delay statements.

   --  It is best to spawn any subprocesses very early, before the parent
   --  process creates tasks, locks, or installs signal handlers. Certainly
   --  avoid doing simultaneous spawns from multiple threads of the same
   --  process.

   --  There is no problem spawning a subprocess that uses tasking: the
   --  problems are caused only by tasking in the parent.

   --  If the parent is using tasking, and needs to spawn subprocesses at
   --  arbitrary times, one technique is for the parent to spawn (very early)
   --  a particular spawn-manager subprocess whose job is to spawn other
   --  processes. The spawn-manager must avoid tasking. The parent sends
   --  messages to the spawn-manager requesting it to spawn processes, using
   --  whatever inter-process communication mechanism you like, such as
   --  sockets.

   --  In short, mixing spawning of subprocesses with tasking is a tricky
   --  business, and should be avoided if possible, but if it is necessary,
   --  the above guidelines should be followed, and you should beware of
   --  portability problems.
