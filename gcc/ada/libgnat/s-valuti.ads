--  This package provides some common utilities used by the s-valxxx files

package System.Val_Util
  with SPARK_Mode, Pure
is
   procedure Bad_Value (S : String) with No_Return;
   --  Raises constraint error with message: bad input for 'Value: "xxx"

   procedure Normalize_String
     (S             : in out String;
      F, L          : out Integer;
      To_Upper_Case : Boolean);
   --  This procedure scans the string S setting F to be the index of the first
   --  non-blank character of S and L to be the index of the last non-blank
   --  character of S. If To_Upper_Case is True and S does not represent a
   --  character literal, then any lower case characters in S are changed to
   --  their upper case counterparts. If S consists of only blank characters
   --  (including when S = "") then we return with F > L.

   procedure Scan_Sign
     (Str   : String;
      Ptr   : not null access Integer;
      Max   : Integer;
      Minus : out Boolean;
      Start : out Positive);
   --  The Str, Ptr, Max parameters are as for the scan routines (Str is the
   --  string to be scanned starting at Ptr.all, and Max is the index of the
   --  last character in the string). Scan_Sign first scans out any initial
   --  blanks, raising Constraint_Error if the field is all blank. It then
   --  checks for and skips an initial plus or minus (Constraint_Error is
   --  raised if plus or minus appears at the end of the string). Minus is set
   --  True if a minus sign was skipped, and False otherwise. On exit Ptr.all
   --  points to the character after the sign, or to the first non-blank
   --  character if no sign is present. Start is set to the point to the first
   --  non-blank character.
   --
   --  Note: if Str is null, i.e. if Max is less than Ptr, then this is a
   --  special case of an all-blank string, and Ptr is unchanged, and hence
   --  is greater than Max as required in this case. Constraint_Error is also
   --  raised in this case.
   --
   --  This routine must not be called with Str'Last = Positive'Last. There is
   --  no check for this case, the caller must ensure this condition is met.

   procedure Scan_Plus_Sign
     (Str   : String;
      Ptr   : not null access Integer;
      Max   : Integer;
      Start : out Positive);
   --  Same as Scan_Sign, but allows only plus, not minus. This is used for
   --  modular types.

   procedure Scan_Exponent
     (Str  : String;
      Ptr  : not null access Integer;
      Max  : Integer;
      Exp  : out Integer;
      Real : Boolean := False);
   --  Called to scan a possible exponent. Str, Ptr, Max are as described above
   --  for Scan_Sign. If Ptr.all < Max and Str (Ptr.all) = 'E' or 'e', then an
   --  exponent is scanned out, with the exponent value returned in Exp, and
   --  Ptr.all updated to point past the exponent. If the exponent field is
   --  incorrectly formed or not present, then Ptr.all is unchanged, and the
   --  returned exponent value is zero. Real indicates whether a minus sign
   --  is permitted (True = permitted). Very large exponents are handled by
   --  returning a suitable large value. If the base is zero, then any value
   --  is allowed, and otherwise the large value will either cause underflow
   --  or overflow during the scaling process which is fine.
   --
   --  This routine must not be called with Str'Last = Positive'Last. There is
   --  no check for this case, the caller must ensure this condition is met.

   procedure Scan_Trailing_Blanks (Str : String; P : Positive);
   --  Checks that the remainder of the field Str (P .. Str'Last) is all
   --  blanks. Raises Constraint_Error if a non-blank character is found.

   procedure Scan_Underscore
     (Str : String;
      P   : in out Natural;
      Ptr : not null access Integer;
      Max : Integer;
      Ext : Boolean);
   --  Called if an underscore is encountered while scanning digits. Str (P)
   --  contains the underscore. Ptr is the pointer to be returned to the
   --  ultimate caller of the scan routine, Max is the maximum subscript in
   --  Str, and Ext indicates if extended digits are allowed. In the case
   --  where the underscore is invalid, Constraint_Error is raised with Ptr
   --  set appropriately, otherwise control returns with P incremented past
   --  the underscore.
   --
   --  This routine must not be called with Str'Last = Positive'Last. There is
   --  no check for this case, the caller must ensure this condition is met.
