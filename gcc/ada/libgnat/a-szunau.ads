--  This child package of Ada.Strings.Wide_Wide_Unbounded provides some
--  specialized access functions which are intended to allow more efficient
--  use of the facilities of Ada.Strings.Wide_Wide_Unbounded, particularly by
--  other layered utilities.

package Ada.Strings.Wide_Wide_Unbounded.Aux is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   subtype Big_Wide_Wide_String is Wide_Wide_String (Positive);
   type Big_Wide_Wide_String_Access is access all Big_Wide_Wide_String;

   procedure Get_Wide_Wide_String
     (U : Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String;
      S : out Big_Wide_Wide_String_Access;
      L : out Natural);
   pragma Inline (Get_Wide_Wide_String);
   --  This procedure returns the internal string pointer used in the
   --  representation of an unbounded string as well as the actual current
   --  length (which may be less than S.all'Length because in general there
   --  can be extra space assigned). The characters of this string may be
   --  not be modified via the returned pointer,  and are valid only as
   --  long as the original unbounded string is not accessed or modified.
   --
   --  This procedure is more efficient than the use of To_Wide_Wide_String
   --  since it avoids the need to copy the string. The lower bound of the
   --  referenced string returned by this call is always one, so the actual
   --  string data is always accessible as S (1 .. L).

   procedure Set_Wide_Wide_String
     (UP : out Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String;
      S  : Wide_Wide_String)
      renames Set_Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String;
   --  This function sets the string contents of the referenced unbounded
   --  string to the given string value. It is significantly more efficient
   --  than the use of To_Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String with an assignment, since
   --  it avoids the necessity of messing with finalization chains. The lower
   --  bound of the string S is not required to be one.

   procedure Set_Wide_Wide_String
     (UP : in out Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String;
      S  : Wide_Wide_String_Access);
   pragma Inline (Set_Wide_Wide_String);
   --  This version of Set_Wide_Wide_String takes a string access value, rather
   --  than string. The lower bound of the string value is required to be one,
   --  and this requirement is not checked.

   procedure Set_Wide_Wide_String
     (U      : out Unbounded_Wide_Wide_String;
      Length : Positive;
      Set    : not null access procedure (S : out Wide_Wide_String));
   pragma Inline (Set_Wide_Wide_String);
   --  Create an unbounded string U with the given Length, using Set to fill
   --  the contents of U.
