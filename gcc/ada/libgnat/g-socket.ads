--  This package provides an interface to the sockets communication facility
--  provided on many operating systems. This is implemented on the following
--  platforms:

--     All native ports, with restrictions as follows

--       Multicast is available only on systems which provide support for this
--       feature, so it is not available if Multicast is not supported, or not
--       installed.

--     VxWorks cross ports fully implement this package

--     This package is not yet implemented on LynxOS or other cross ports

package GNAT.Sockets is

   --  Sockets are designed to provide a consistent communication facility
   --  between applications. This package provides an Ada binding to the
   --  de-facto standard BSD sockets API. The documentation below covers
   --  only the specific binding provided by this package. It assumes that
   --  the reader is already familiar with general network programming and
   --  sockets usage. A useful reference on this matter is W. Richard Stevens'
   --  "UNIX Network Programming: The Sockets Networking API"
   --  (ISBN: 0131411551).

   --  GNAT.Sockets has been designed with several ideas in mind

   --  This is a system independent interface. Therefore, we try as much as
   --  possible to mask system incompatibilities. Some functionalities are not
   --  available because there are not fully supported on some systems.

   --  This is a thick binding. For instance, a major effort has been done to
   --  avoid using memory addresses or untyped ints. We preferred to define
   --  streams and enumeration types. Errors are not returned as returned
   --  values but as exceptions.

   --  This package provides a POSIX-compliant interface (between two
   --  different implementations of the same routine, we adopt the one closest
   --  to the POSIX specification). For instance, using select(), the
   --  notification of an asynchronous connect failure is delivered in the
   --  write socket set (POSIX) instead of the exception socket set (NT).

   --  The example below demonstrates various features of GNAT.Sockets:

   --  with Ada.Exceptions; use Ada.Exceptions;

   --        Address.Port := 5876;

   --        --  The first step is to create a socket. Once created, this

   --        --  server (Pong here) needs to bind an address explicitly. Most
   --        --  of the time clients can skip this step because the socket

   --  The select(2) system call waits for events to occur on any of a set of
   --  file descriptors. Usually, three independent sets of descriptors are
   --  watched (read, write  and exception). A timeout gives an upper bound
   --  on the amount of time elapsed before select returns. This function
   --  blocks until an event occurs. On some platforms, the select(2) system
   --  can block the full process (not just the calling thread).
   --
   --  Check_Selector provides the very same behavior. The only difference is
   --  that it does not watch for exception events. Note that on some platforms
   --  it is kept process blocking on purpose. The timeout parameter allows the
   --  user to have the behavior he wants. Abort_Selector allows the safe
   --  abort of a blocked Check_Selector call. A special socket is opened by
   --  Create_Selector and included in each call to Check_Selector.
   --
   --  Abort_Selector causes an event to occur on this descriptor in order to
   --  unblock Check_Selector. Note that each call to Abort_Selector will cause
   --  exactly one call to Check_Selector to return with Aborted status. The
   --  special socket created by Create_Selector is closed when Close_Selector
   --  is called.
   --
   --  A typical case where it is useful to abort a Check_Selector operation is
   --  the situation where a change to the monitored sockets set must be made.

   --  one Socket in W_Socket_Set is ready to transmit some data. In these
   --  cases Status is set to Completed and sockets that are ready are set in
   --  R_Socket_Set or W_Socket_Set. Status is set to Expired if no socket was
   --  ready after a Timeout expiration. Status is set to Aborted if an abort
   --  signal has been received while checking socket status.
   --
   --  Note that two different Socket_Set_Type objects must be passed as
   --  R_Socket_Set and W_Socket_Set (even if they denote the same set of
   --  Sockets), or some event may be lost. Also keep in mind that this
   --  procedure modifies the passed socket sets to indicate which sockets
   --  actually had events upon return. The socket set therefore has to
   --  be reset by the caller for further calls.
   --
   --  Socket_Error is raised when the select(2) system call returns an error
   --  condition, or when a read error occurs on the signalling socket used for
   --  the implementation of Abort_Selector.
