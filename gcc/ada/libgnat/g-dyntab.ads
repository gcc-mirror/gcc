--  Resizable one dimensional array support

--  This package provides an implementation of dynamically resizable one
--  dimensional arrays. The idea is to mimic the normal Ada semantics for
--  arrays as closely as possible with the one additional capability of
--  dynamically modifying the value of the Last attribute.

--  This package provides a facility similar to that of Ada.Containers.Vectors.

--  Note that these three interfaces should remain synchronized to keep as much
--  coherency as possible among these related units:
--
--     GNAT.Dynamic_Tables
--     GNAT.Table
--     Table (the compiler unit)

--  Note: this unit is used during bootstrap, see ADA_GENERATED_FILES in
--  gcc-interface/Make-lang.in for details on the constraints.

package GNAT.Dynamic_Tables is

   --  Table_Component_Type and Table_Index_Type specify the type of the array,
   --  Table_Low_Bound is the lower bound. The effect is roughly to declare:

   --    Table : array (Table_Low_Bound .. <>) of Table_Component_Type;

   --  The lower bound of Table_Index_Type is ignored.

   --  Table_Component_Type must not be a type with controlled parts.

   --  The Table_Initial value controls the allocation of the table when it is
   --  first allocated.

   --  The Table_Increment value controls the amount of increase, if the table
   --  has to be increased in size. The value given is a percentage value (e.g.
   --  100 = increase table size by 100%, i.e. double it).

   --  The Last and Set_Last subprograms provide control over the current
   --  logical allocation. They are quite efficient, so they can be used
   --  freely (expensive reallocation occurs only at major granularity
   --  chunks controlled by the allocation parameters).

   --  WARNING: On HPPA, the virtual addressing approach used in this unit is
   --  incompatible with the indexing instructions on the HPPA. So when using
   --  this unit, compile your application with -mdisable-indexing.

   --  WARNING: If the table is reallocated, then the address of all its
   --  components will change. So do not capture the address of an element
   --  and then use the address later after the table may be reallocated. One
   --  tricky case of this is passing an element of the table to a subprogram
   --  by reference where the table gets reallocated during the execution of
   --  the subprogram. The best rule to follow is never to pass a table element
   --  as a parameter except for the case of IN mode parameters with scalar
   --  values.

   --  Note: For backward compatibility we do not make the table components

   --  pointer, which is more efficient. Since subscript checks in any case
   --  must be on the logical, rather than physical bounds, safety is not
   --  compromised by this approach.

   --  To get subscript checking, rename a slice of the Table, like this:

   --     Table : Table_Type renames T.Table (First .. Last (T));
