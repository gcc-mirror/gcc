--  External files may be classified as directories, special files, or ordinary
--  files. A directory is an external file that is a container for files on
--  the target system. A special file is an external file that cannot be
--  created or read by a predefined Ada Input-Output package. External files
--  that are not special files or directories are called ordinary files.

--  A file name is a string identifying an external file. Similarly, a
--  directory name is a string identifying a directory. The interpretation of
--  file names and directory names is implementation-defined.

--  The full name of an external file is a full specification of the name of
--  the file. If the external environment allows alternative specifications of
--  the name (for example, abbreviations), the full name should not use such
--  alternatives. A full name typically will include the names of all of
--  directories that contain the item. The simple name of an external file is
--  the name of the item, not including any containing directory names. Unless
--  otherwise specified, a file name or directory name parameter to a
--  predefined Ada input-output subprogram can be a full name, a simple name,
--  or any other form of name supported by the implementation.

--  The default directory is the directory that is used if a directory or
--  file name is not a full name (that is, when the name does not fully
--  identify all of the containing directories).

--  A directory entry is a single item in a directory, identifying a single
--  external file (including directories and special files).

--  For each function that returns a string, the lower bound of the returned
--  value is 1.

   procedure Set_Directory (Directory : String);
   --  Sets the current default directory. The exception Name_Error is
   --  propagated if the string given as Directory does not identify an

   --  identification of a directory. The exception Use_Error is propagated if
   --  the external environment does not support the creation of a directory
   --  with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error) and form.
   --
   --  The Form parameter is ignored

   procedure Delete_Directory (Directory : String);
   --  Deletes an existing empty directory with name Directory. The exception
   --  Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Directory does not

   --  if the external environment does not support the deletion of the
   --  directory (or some portion of its contents) with the given name (in the

      Form          : String := "");
   --  Creates zero or more directories with name New_Directory. Each
   --  non-existent directory named by New_Directory is created. For example,
   --  on a typical Unix system, Create_Path ("/usr/me/my"); would create
   --  directory "me" in directory "usr", then create directory "my"
   --  in directory "me". The Form can be used to give system-dependent
   --  characteristics of the directory; the interpretation of the Form
   --  parameter is implementation-defined. A null string for Form specifies
   --  the use of the default options of the implementation of the new

   --  support the creation of any directories with the given name (in the
   --  absence of Name_Error) and form.

   --  all of its contents (possibly including other directories) are deleted.
   --  The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Directory
   --  does not identify an existing directory. The exception Use_Error is
   --  propagated if the external environment does not support the deletion
   --  of the directory or some portion of its contents with the given name
   --  (in the absence of Name_Error). If Use_Error is propagated, it is
   --  unspecified if a portion of the contents of the directory are deleted.

   procedure Delete_File (Name : String);
   --  Deletes an existing ordinary or special file with Name. The exception
   --  Name_Error is propagated if the string given as Name does not identify

   --  to New_Name. The exception Name_Error is propagated if the string given
   --  as Old_Name does not identify an existing external file. The exception
   --  Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not support the
   --  renaming of the file with the given name (in the absence of Name_Error).
   --  In particular, Use_Error is propagated if a file or directory already
   --  exists with New_Name.

   procedure Copy_File
     (Source_Name   : String;
      Target_Name   : String;

   --  Copies the contents of the existing external file with Source_Name to
   --  Target_Name. The resulting external file is a duplicate of the source
   --  external file. The Form argument can be used to give system-dependent
   --  characteristics of the resulting external file; the interpretation of
   --  the Form parameter is implementation-defined. Exception Name_Error is
   --  propagated if the string given as Source_Name does not identify an
   --  existing external ordinary or special file or if the string given as
   --  Target_Name does not allow the identification of an external file. The
   --  exception Use_Error is propagated if the external environment does not
   --  support the creating of the file with the name given by Target_Name and
   --  form given by Form, or copying of the file with the name given by
   --  Source_Name (in the absence of Name_Error).
   --
   --  Interpretation of the Form parameter:
   --
   --    The Form parameter is case-insensitive
   --
   --    Two fields are recognized in the Form parameter:
   --      preserve=<value>
   --      mode=<value>
   --
   --      <value> starts immediately after the character '=' and ends with the
   --      character immediately preceding the next comma (',') or with the
   --      last character of the parameter.
   --
   --      The allowed values for preserve= are:
   --
   --        no_attributes:  Do not try to preserve any file attributes. This
   --                        is the default if no preserve= is found in Form.
   --
   --        all_attributes: Try to preserve all file attributes (timestamps,
   --                        access rights).
   --
   --        timestamps:     Preserve the timestamp of the copied file, but not
   --                        the other file attributes.
   --
   --      The allowed values for mode= are:
   --
   --        copy:           Only copy if the destination file does not already
   --                        exist. If it already exists, Copy_File will fail.
   --
   --        overwrite:      Copy the file in all cases. Overwrite an already
   --                        existing destination file. This is the default if
   --                        no mode= is found in Form.
   --
   --        append:         Append the original file to the destination file.
   --                        If the destination file does not exist, the
   --                        destination file is a copy of the source file.
   --                        When mode=append, the field preserve=, if it
   --                        exists, is not taken into account.
   --
   --    If the Form parameter includes one or both of the fields and the value
   --    or values are incorrect, Copy_File fails with Use_Error.
   --
   --    Examples of correct Forms:
   --       Form => "preserve=no_attributes,mode=overwrite" (the default)
   --       Form => "mode=append"
   --       Form => "mode=copy,preserve=all_attributes"
   --
   --    Examples of incorrect Forms:
   --       Form => "preserve=junk"
   --       Form => "mode=internal,preserve=timestamps"

   function Name_Case_Equivalence (Name : String) return Name_Case_Kind;
