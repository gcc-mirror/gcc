   --  This package contains subprograms that are called by the generated code
   --  for the 'Put_Image attribute.
   --
   --  For a signed integer type that fits in Integer, the actual parameter is
   --  converted to Integer, and Put_Image_Integer is called. For larger types,
   --  Put_Image_Long_Long_Integer or Put_Image_Long_Long_Long_Integer is used.
   --  For a modular integer type, this is similar with Integer replaced with
   --  Unsigned. Access values are unchecked-converted to either Thin_Pointer
   --  or Fat_Pointer, and Put_Image_Thin_Pointer or Put_Image_Fat_Pointer is
   --  called. The Before/Between/After procedures are called before printing
   --  the components of a composite type, between pairs of components, and
   --  after them. See Exp_Put_Image in the compiler for details of these
   --  calls.
