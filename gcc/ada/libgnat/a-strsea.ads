--  This package contains the search functions from Ada.Strings.Fixed. They
--  are separated out because they are shared by Ada.Strings.Bounded and
--  Ada.Strings.Unbounded, and we don't want to drag in other irrelevant stuff
--  from Ada.Strings.Fixed when using the other two packages. Although user
--  programs should access these subprograms via one of the standard string
--  packages, we do not make this a private package, since ghost function
--  Match is used in the contracts of the standard string packages.

--  Preconditions in this unit are meant for analysis only, not for run-time
--  checking, so that the expected exceptions are raised. This is enforced
--  by setting the corresponding assertion policy to Ignore. Postconditions,
--  contract cases and ghost code should not be executed at runtime as well,
--  in order not to slow down the execution of these functions.
