   -- Implementation of Time --
   ----------------------------

   --  Time is represented as a signed 64 bit integer count of nanoseconds
   --  since the start of Ada time (1901-01-01 00:00:00.0 UTC). Time values
   --  produced by Time_Of are internally normalized to UTC regardless of their
   --  local time zone. This representation ensures correct handling of leap
   --  seconds as well as performing arithmetic. In Ada 95, Split and Time_Of
   --  will treat a time value as being in the local time zone, in Ada 2005,
   --  Split and Time_Of will treat a time value as being in the designated
   --  time zone by the formal parameter or in UTC by default. The size of the
   --  type is large enough to cover the Ada 2005 range of time (1901-01-01
   --  00:00:00.0 UTC - 2399-12-31-23:59:59.999999999 UTC).

   ------------------
   -- Leap Seconds --
   ------------------

   --  Due to Earth's slowdown, the astronomical time is not as precise as the
   --  International Atomic Time. To compensate for this inaccuracy, a single
   --  leap second is added after the last day of June or December. The count
   --  of seconds during those occurrences becomes:

   --    ... 58, 59, leap second 60, 0, 1, 2 ...

   --  Unlike leap days, leap seconds occur simultaneously around the world.
   --  In other words, if a leap second occurs at 23:59:60 UTC, it also occurs
   --  on 18:59:60 -5 the same day or 2:59:60 +2 on the next day.

   --  Leap seconds do not follow a formula. The International Earth Rotation
   --  and Reference System Service decides when to add one. Leap seconds are
   --  included in the representation of time in Ada 95 mode. As a result,
   --  the following two time values will differ by two seconds:

   --    1972-06-30 23:59:59.0
   --    1972-07-01 00:00:00.0

   --  When a new leap second is introduced, the following steps must be
   --  carried out:

   --     1) Increment Leap_Seconds_Count in a-calend.adb by one
   --     2) Increment LS_Count in xleaps.adb by one
   --     3) Add the new date to the aggregate of array LS_Dates in
   --        xleaps.adb
   --     4) Compile and execute xleaps
   --     5) Replace the values of Leap_Second_Times in a-calend.adb with the
   --        aggregate generated by xleaps

   --  The algorithms that build the actual leap second values and discover
   --  how many leap seconds have occurred between two dates do not need any
   --  modification.

   ------------------------------
   -- Non-leap Centennial Years --
   ------------------------------

   --  Over the range of Ada time, centennial years 2100, 2200 and 2300 are
   --  non-leap. As a consequence, seven non-leap years occur over the period
   --  of year - 4 to year + 4. Internally, routines Split and Time_Of add or
   --  subtract a "fake" February 29 to facilitate the arithmetic involved.
