--  This spec is derived from package Ada.Containers.Bounded_Hashed_Sets in the
--  Ada 2012 RM. The modifications are meant to facilitate formal proofs by
--  making it easier to express properties, and by making the specification of
--  this unit compatible with SPARK 2014. Note that the API of this unit may be
--  subject to incompatible changes as SPARK 2014 evolves.

--  The modifications are:

--    A parameter for the container is added to every function reading the
--    content of a container: Element, Next, Query_Element, Has_Element, Key,
--    Iterate, Equivalent_Elements. This change is motivated by the need to
--    have cursors which are valid on different containers (typically a
--    container C and its previous version C'Old) for expressing properties,
--    which is not possible if cursors encapsulate an access to the underlying
--    container.
