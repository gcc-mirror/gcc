--  This package contains a procedure for runtime concatenation of eight string
--  operands. It is used when we want to save space in the generated code.

package System.Concat_9 is

   procedure Str_Concat_9
     (R                                  : out String;
      S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 : String);
   --  Performs the operation R := S1 & S2 & S3 & S4 & S5 & S6 & S7 & S8 & S9.
   --  The bounds of R are known to be sufficient so no bound checks are
   --  required, and it is known that none of the input operands overlaps R. No
   --  assumptions can be made about the lower bounds of any of the operands.

end System.Concat_9;
