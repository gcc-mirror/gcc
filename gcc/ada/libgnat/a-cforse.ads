--  This spec is derived from package Ada.Containers.Bounded_Ordered_Sets in
--  the Ada 2012 RM. The modifications are meant to facilitate formal proofs by
--  making it easier to express properties, and by making the specification of
--  this unit compatible with SPARK 2014. Note that the API of this unit may be
--  subject to incompatible changes as SPARK 2014 evolves.

--  The modifications are:

--    A parameter for the container is added to every function reading the
--    content of a container: Key, Element, Next, Query_Element, Previous,
--    Has_Element, Iterate, Reverse_Iterate. This change is motivated by the
--    need to have cursors which are valid on different containers (typically
--    a container C and its previous version C'Old) for expressing properties,
--    which is not possible if cursors encapsulate an access to the underlying
--    container. The operators "<" and ">" that could not be modified that way
--    have been removed.
