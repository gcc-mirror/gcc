--  The language-defined package Strings.Fixed provides string-handling
--  subprograms for fixed-length strings; that is, for values of type
--  Standard.String. Several of these subprograms are procedures that modify
--  the contents of a String that is passed as an out or an in out parameter;
--  each has additional parameters to control the effect when the logical
--  length of the result differs from the parameter's length.
--
--  For each function that returns a String, the lower bound of the returned
--  value is 1.
--
--  The basic model embodied in the package is that a fixed-length string
--  comprises significant characters and possibly padding (with space
--  characters) on either or both ends. When a shorter string is copied to a
--  longer string, padding is inserted, and when a longer string is copied to a
--  shorter one, padding is stripped. The Move procedure in Strings.Fixed,
--  which takes a String as an out parameter, allows the programmer to control
--  these effects. Similar control is provided by the string transformation
--  procedures.

--  Preconditions in this unit are meant for analysis only, not for run-time
--  checking, so that the expected exceptions are raised. This is enforced by
--  setting the corresponding assertion policy to Ignore. Postconditions and
--  contract cases should not be executed at runtime as well, in order not to
--  slow down the execution of these functions.

     (Source  : String;
      Target  : out String;

   --  The Move procedure copies characters from Source to Target. If Source
   --  has the same length as Target, then the effect is to assign Source to
   --  Target. If Source is shorter than Target then:
   --
   --  * If Justify=Left, then Source is copied into the first Source'Length
   --    characters of Target.
   --
   --  * If Justify=Right, then Source is copied into the last Source'Length
   --    characters of Target.
   --
   --  * If Justify=Center, then Source is copied into the middle Source'Length
   --    characters of Target. In this case, if the difference in length
   --    between Target and Source is odd, then the extra Pad character is on
   --    the right.
   --
   --  * Pad is copied to each Target character not otherwise assigned.
   --
   --  If Source is longer than Target, then the effect is based on Drop.
   --
   --  * If Drop=Left, then the rightmost Target'Length characters of Source
   --    are copied into Target.
   --
   --  * If Drop=Right, then the leftmost Target'Length characters of Source
   --    are copied into Target.
   --
   --  * If Drop=Error, then the effect depends on the value of the Justify
   --    parameter and also on whether any characters in Source other than Pad
   --    would fail to be copied:
   --
   --    * If Justify=Left, and if each of the rightmost
   --      Source'Length-Target'Length characters in Source is Pad, then the
   --      leftmost Target'Length characters of Source are copied to Target.
   --
   --    * If Justify=Right, and if each of the leftmost
   --      Source'Length-Target'Length characters in Source is Pad, then the
   --      rightmost Target'Length characters of Source are copied to Target.
   --
   --    * Otherwise, Length_Error is propagated.
