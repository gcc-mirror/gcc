--  This package provides a reset routine that resets the standard files used
--  by Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO. This is useful in systems such as VxWorks where
--  Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO is elaborated at the program start, but a system
--  restart may alter the status of these files, resulting in incorrect
--  operation of Wide_Wide_Text_IO (in particular if the standard input file
--  is changed to be interactive, then Get_Line may hang looking for an extra
--  character after the end of the line.

procedure Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Reset_Standard_Files;
--  Reset standard Wide_Wide_Text_IO files as described above
