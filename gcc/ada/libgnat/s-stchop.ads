   --  optimization purposes, nothing can be assumed about the contents of the
   --  cache at any time, see Set_Stack_Info.

   --  The stack cache should contain the bounds of the current task.  But
   --  because the RTS is not aware of task switches, the stack cache may be
   --  incorrect.  So when the stack pointer is not within the bounds of the
   --  stack cache, Stack_Check first update the cache (which is a costly
   --  operation hence the need of a cache).

   procedure Invalidate_Stack_Cache (Any_Stack : Stack_Access);
   --  Invalidate cache entries for the task T that owns Any_Stack. This causes
   --  the Set_Stack_Info function to be called during the next stack check
   --  done by T. This can be used to interrupt task T asynchronously.
