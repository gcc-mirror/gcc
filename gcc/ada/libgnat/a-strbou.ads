--  The language-defined package Strings.Bounded provides a generic package
--  each of whose instances yields a private type Bounded_String and a set
--  of operations. An object of a particular Bounded_String type represents
--  a String whose low bound is 1 and whose length can vary conceptually
--  between 0 and a maximum size established at the generic instantiation. The
--  subprograms for fixed-length string handling are either overloaded directly
--  for Bounded_String, or are modified as needed to reflect the variability in
--  length. Additionally, since the Bounded_String type is private, appropriate
--  constructor and selector operations are provided.

      --  Superbounded.Super_String with the maximum length constraint. In
      --  almost all cases, the routines in Superbounded can be called with
      --  no requirement to pass the maximum length explicitly, since there
