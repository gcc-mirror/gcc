   -- Implementation Dependent Attributes --
   -----------------------------------------

   --  This section describes the implementation dependent attributes provided
   --  in GNAT, as well as constructing an array of flags indicating which
   --  attributes these are.

   Attribute_Impl_Def : constant Attribute_Set :=
     (

      ------------------
      -- Abort_Signal --
      ------------------

      Attribute_Abort_Signal => True,
      --  Standard'Abort_Signal (Standard is the only allowed prefix) provides
      --  the entity for the special exception used to signal task abort or
      --  asynchronous transfer of control. Normally this attribute should only
      --  be used in the tasking runtime (it is highly peculiar, and completely
      --  outside the normal semantics of Ada, for a user program to intercept
      --  the abort exception).

      ------------------
      -- Address_Size --
      ------------------

      Attribute_Address_Size => True,
      --  Standard'Address_Size (Standard is the only allowed prefix) is
      --  a static constant giving the number of bits in an Address. It
      --  is used primarily for constructing the definition of Memory_Size
      --  in package Standard, but may be freely used in user programs.
      --  This is a static attribute.

      ---------------
      -- Asm_Input --
      ---------------

      Attribute_Asm_Input => True,
      --  Used only in conjunction with the Asm subprograms in package
      --  Machine_Code to construct machine instructions. See documentation
      --  in package Machine_Code in file s-maccod.ads.

      ----------------
      -- Asm_Output --
      ----------------

      Attribute_Asm_Output => True,
      --  Used only in conjunction with the Asm subprograms in package
      --  Machine_Code to construct machine instructions. See documentation
      --  in package Machine_Code in file s-maccod.ads.

      ---------
      -- Bit --
      ---------

      Attribute_Bit => True,
      --  Obj'Bit, where Obj is any object, yields the bit offset within the
      --  storage unit (byte) that contains the first bit of storage allocated
      --  for the object. The attribute value is of type Universal_Integer,
      --  and is always a non-negative number not exceeding the value of
      --  System.Storage_Unit.
      --
      --  For an object that is a variable or a constant allocated in a
      --  register, the value is zero. (The use of this attribute does not
      --  force the allocation of a variable to memory).
      --
      --  For an object that is a formal parameter, this attribute applies to
      --  either the matching actual parameter or to a copy of the matching
      --  actual parameter.
      --
      --  For an access object the value is zero. Note that Obj.all'Bit is
      --  subject to an Access_Check for the designated object. Similarly
      --  for a record component X.C'Bit is subject to a discriminant check
      --  and X(I).Bit and X(I1..I2)'Bit are subject to index checks.
      --
      --  This attribute is designed to be compatible with the DEC Ada
      --  definition and implementation of the Bit attribute.

      -- Code_Address --
      ------------------

      Attribute_Code_Address => True,
      --  The reference subp'Code_Address, where subp is a subprogram entity,
      --  gives the address of the first generated instruction for the sub-
      --  program. This is often, but not always the same as the 'Address
      --  value, which is the address to be used in a call. The differences
      --  occur in the case of a nested procedure (where Address yields the
      --  address of the trampoline code used to load the static link), and on
      --  some systems which use procedure descriptors (in which case Address
      --  yields the address of the descriptor).

      -----------------------

      Attribute_Default_Bit_Order => True,
      --  Standard'Default_Bit_Order (Standard is the only permissible prefix)
      --  provides the value System.Default_Bit_Order as a Pos value (0 for
      --  High_Order_First, 1 for Low_Order_First). This is used to construct

      -- Default_Scalar_Storage_Order --
      ----------------------------------

      Attribute_Default_Scalar_Storage_Order => True,
      --  Standard'Default_Scalar_Storage_Order (Standard is the
      --  only permissible prefix) provides the current value of the
      --  default scalar storage order (as specified using pragma
      --  Default_Scalar_Storage_Order, or equal to Default_Bit_Order if
      --  unspecified) as a System.Bit_Order value. This is a static attribute.

      -----------
      -- Deref --
      -----------

      Attribute_Deref => True,
      --  typ'Deref (expr) is valid only if expr is of type System'Address.
      --  The result is an object of type typ that is obtained by treating the
      --  address as an access-to-typ value that points to the result. It is
      --  basically equivalent to (atyp!expr).all where atyp is an access type
      --  for the type.

      ---------------
      -- Elab_Body --
      ---------------

      Attribute_Elab_Body => True,
      --  This attribute can only be applied to a program unit name. It
      --  returns the entity for the corresponding elaboration procedure for
      --  elaborating the body of the referenced unit. This is used in the main
      --  generated elaboration procedure by the binder, and is not normally
      --  used in any other context, but there may be specialized situations in
      --  which it is useful to be able to call this elaboration procedure from
      --  Ada code, e.g. if it is necessary to do selective reelaboration to
      --  fix some error.

      --------------------
      -- Elab_Subp_Body --
      --------------------

      Attribute_Elab_Subp_Body => True,
      --  This attribute can only be applied to a library level subprogram
      --  name and is only relevant in CodePeer mode. It returns the entity
      --  for the corresponding elaboration procedure for elaborating the body
      --  of the referenced subprogram unit. This is used in the main generated
      --  elaboration procedure by the binder in CodePeer mode only.

      ---------------
      -- Elab_Spec --
      ---------------

      Attribute_Elab_Spec => True,
      --  This attribute can only be applied to a program unit name. It
      --  returns the entity for the corresponding elaboration procedure for
      --  elaborating the spec of the referenced unit. This is used in the main
      --  generated elaboration procedure by the binder, and is not normally
      --  used in any other context, but there may be specialized situations in
      --  which it is useful to be able to call this elaboration procedure from
      --  Ada code, e.g. if it is necessary to do selective reelaboration to
      --  fix some error.

      ----------------
      -- Elaborated --
      ----------------

      Attribute_Elaborated => True,

      --  value indicating whether or not the body of the designated library
      --  unit has been elaborated yet.

      -----------------------
      -- Finalization_Size --
      -----------------------

      Attribute_Finalization_Size => True,
      --  For every object or non-class-wide-type, Finalization_Size returns
      --  the size of the hidden header used for finalization purposes as if
      --  the object or type was allocated on the heap. The size of the header
      --  does take into account any extra padding due to alignment issues.

      -----------------
      -- Fixed_Value --
      -----------------

      Attribute_Fixed_Value => True,
      --  For every fixed-point type S, S'Fixed_Value denotes a function
      --  with the following specification:
      --
      --    function S'Fixed_Value (Arg : universal_integer) return S;
      --
      --  The value returned is the fixed-point value V such that
      --
      --    V = Arg * S'Small
      --
      --  The effect is thus equivalent to first converting the argument to
      --  the integer type used to represent S, and then doing an unchecked
      --  conversion to the fixed-point type. This attribute is primarily
      --  intended for use in implementation of the input-output functions
      --  for fixed-point values.

      -----------------------
      -- Has_Discriminants --
      -----------------------

      Attribute_Has_Discriminants => True,
      --  Gtyp'Has_Discriminants, where Gtyp is a generic formal type, yields
      --  a Boolean value indicating whether or not the actual instantiation
      --  type has discriminants.

      ---------
      -- Img --
      ---------

      Attribute_Img => True,
      --  The 'Img function is defined for any prefix, P, that denotes an
      --  object of scalar type T. P'Img is equivalent to T'Image (P). This
      --  is convenient for debugging. For example:
      --
      --     Put_Line ("X = " & X'Img);
      --
      --  has the same meaning as the more verbose:
      --
      --     Put_Line ("X = " & Temperature_Type'Image (X));
      --
      --  where Temperature_Type is the subtype of the object X.

      -------------------
      -- Integer_Value --
      -------------------

      Attribute_Integer_Value => True,
      --  For every integer type S, S'Integer_Value denotes a function
      --  with the following specification:
      --
      --    function S'Integer_Value (Arg : universal_fixed) return S;
      --
      --  The value returned is the integer value V, such that
      --
      --    Arg = V * fixed-type'Small
      --
      --  The effect is thus equivalent to first doing an unchecked convert
      --  from the fixed-point type to its corresponding implementation type,
      --  and then converting the result to the target integer type. This
      --  attribute is primarily intended for use in implementation of the
      --  standard input-output functions for fixed-point values.

      --------------------
      --  Invalid_Value --
      --------------------

      Attribute_Invalid_Value => True,
      --  For every scalar type, S'Invalid_Value designates an undefined value
      --  of the type. If possible this value is an invalid value, and in fact
      --  is identical to the value that would be set if Initialize_Scalars
      --  mode were in effect (including the behavior of its value on
      --  environment variables or binder switches). The intended use is to
      --  set a value where initialization is required (e.g. as a result of the
      --  coding standards in use), but logically no initialization is needed,
      --  and the value should never be accessed.

      ----------------
      -- Loop_Entry --
      ----------------

      Attribute_Loop_Entry => True,
      --  For every object of a non-limited type, S'Loop_Entry [(Loop_Name)]
      --  denotes the constant value of prefix S at the point of entry into the
      --  related loop. The type of the attribute is the type of the prefix.

      ------------------
      -- Machine_Size --
      ------------------

      Attribute_Machine_Size => True,
      --  This attribute is identical to the Object_Size attribute. It is
      --  provided for compatibility with the DEC attribute of this name.

      ----------
      -- Make --
      ----------

      Attribute_Make => True,

      ----------------------
      -- Max_Integer_Size --
      ----------------------

      Attribute_Max_Integer_Size => True,
      --  Standard'Max_Integer_Size (Standard is the only permissible prefix)
      --  provides values System.Min_Int and System.Max_Int, and is intended
      --  primarily for constructing these definitions in package System. This
      --  is a static attribute.

      -----------------------
      -- Maximum_Alignment --
      -----------------------

      Attribute_Maximum_Alignment => True,
      --  Standard'Maximum_Alignment (Standard is the only permissible prefix)
      --  provides the maximum useful alignment value for the target. This is a
      --  static value that can be used to specify the alignment for an object,
      --  guaranteeing that it is properly aligned in all cases. The time this
      --  is useful is when an external object is imported and its alignment
      --  requirements are unknown. This is a static attribute.

      --------------------
      -- Mechanism_Code --
      --------------------

      Attribute_Mechanism_Code => True,
      --  function'Mechanism_Code yields an integer code for the mechanism
      --  used for the result of function, and subprogram'Mechanism_Code (n)
      --  yields the mechanism used for formal parameter number n (a static
      --  integer value, 1 = first parameter). The code returned is:
      --
      --     1 = by copy (value)
      --     2 = by reference
      --     3 = by descriptor (default descriptor type)

      -- Null_Parameter --
      --------------------

      Attribute_Null_Parameter => True,
      --  A reference T'Null_Parameter denotes an (imaginary) object of type
      --  or subtype T allocated at (machine) address zero. The attribute is
      --  allowed only as the default expression of a formal parameter, or
      --  as an actual expression of a subprogram call. In either case, the
      --  subprogram must be imported.
      --
      --  The identity of the object is represented by the address zero in
      --  the argument list, independent of the passing mechanism (explicit
      --  or default).
      --
      --  The reason that this capability is needed is that for a record or
      --  other composite object passed by reference, there is no other way
      --  of specifying that a zero address should be passed.

      -------------------------
      -- Passed_By_Reference --
      -------------------------

      Attribute_Passed_By_Reference => True,
      --  T'Passed_By_Reference for any subtype T returns a boolean value that
      --  is true if the type is normally passed by reference and false if the
      --  type is normally passed by copy in calls. For scalar types, the
      --  result is always False and is static. For non-scalar types, the
      --  result is non-static (since it is computed by Gigi).

      ------------------
      -- Range_Length --
      ------------------

      Attribute_Range_Length => True,
      --  T'Range_Length for any discrete type T yields the number of values
      --  represented by the subtype (zero for a null range). The result is
      --  static for static subtypes. Note that Range_Length applied to the
      --  index subtype of a one dimensional array always gives the same result
      --  as Range applied to the array itself. The result is of type universal
      --  integer.

      ---------
      -- Ref --
      ---------

      Attribute_Ref => True,
      --  System.Address'Ref (Address is the only permissible prefix) is
      --  equivalent to System'To_Address, provided for compatibility with
      --  other compilers.

      -- Storage_Unit --
      ------------------

      Attribute_Storage_Unit => True,
      --  Standard'Storage_Unit (Standard is the only permissible prefix)
      --  provides the value System.Storage_Unit, and is intended primarily
      --  for constructing this definition in package System (see note above
      --  in Default_Bit_Order description). The is a static attribute.

      ---------------
      -- Stub_Type --
      ---------------

      Attribute_Stub_Type => True,
      --  The GNAT implementation of remote access-to-classwide types is
      --  organised as described in AARM E.4(20.t): a value of an RACW type
      --  (designating a remote object) is represented as a normal access
      --  value, pointing to a "stub" object which in turn contains the
      --  necessary information to contact the designated remote object. A
      --  call on any dispatching operation of such a stub object does the
      --  remote call, if necessary, using the information in the stub object
      --  to locate the target partition, etc.
      --
      --  For a prefix T that denotes a remote access-to-classwide type,
      --  T'Stub_Type denotes the type of the corresponding stub objects.
      --
      --  By construction, the layout of T'Stub_Type is identical to that of
      --  System.Partition_Interface.RACW_Stub_Type (see implementation notes

      -- Target_Name --
      -----------------

      Attribute_Target_Name => True,
      --  Standard'Target_Name yields the string identifying the target for the
      --  compilation, taken from Sdefault.Target_Name.

      ----------------
      -- To_Address --
      ----------------

      Attribute_To_Address => True,
      --  System'To_Address (System is the only permissible prefix) is a
      --  function that takes any integer value, and converts it into an
      --  address value. The semantics is to first convert the integer value to
      --  type Integer_Address according to normal conversion rules, and then
      --  to convert this to an address using the same semantics as the
      --  System.Storage_Elements.To_Address function. The important difference
      --  is that this is a static attribute so it can be used in
      --  initializations in preelaborate packages.

      ----------------
      -- Type_Class --
      ----------------

      Attribute_Type_Class => True,
      --  T'Type_Class for any type or subtype T yields the value of the type
      --  class for the full type of T. If T is a generic formal type, then the

      --  with the DEC Ada attribute of the same name.
      --
      --  Note: if pragma Extend_System is used to merge the definitions of
      --  Aux_DEC into System, then the type Type_Class can be referenced

      --  The static result is the string consisting of the characters of
      --  the number as defined in the original source. This allows the
      --  user program to access the actual text of named numbers without
      --  intermediate conversions and without the need to enclose the
      --  strings in quotes (which would preclude their use as numbers).

      -------------------------
      -- Unrestricted_Access --
      -------------------------

      Attribute_Unrestricted_Access => True,
      --  The Unrestricted_Access attribute is similar to Access except that
      --  all accessibility and aliased view checks are omitted. This is very
      --  much a user-beware attribute. Basically its status is very similar
      --  to Address, for which it is a desirable replacement where the value
      --  desired is an access type. In other words, its effect is identical
      --  to first taking 'Address and then doing an unchecked conversion to
      --  a desired access type. Note that in GNAT, but not necessarily in
      --  other implementations, the use of static chains for inner level
      --  subprograms means that Unrestricted_Access applied to a subprogram
      --  yields a value that can be called as long as the subprogram is in
      --  scope (normal Ada 95 accessibility rules restrict this usage).

      -- VADS_Size --
      ---------------

      Attribute_VADS_Size => True,
      --  Typ'VADS_Size yields the Size value typically yielded by some Ada 83
      --  compilers. The differences between VADS_Size and Size is that for
      --  scalar types for which no Size has been specified, VADS_Size yields
      --  the Object_Size rather than the Value_Size. For example, while
      --  Natural'Size is typically 31, the value of Natural'VADS_Size is 32.
      --  For all other types, Size and VADS_Size yield the same value.

      -- Valid_Scalars --
      -------------------

      Attribute_Valid_Scalars => True,
      --  Obj'Valid_Scalars can be applied to any object. The result depends
      --  on the type of the object:
      --
      --    For a scalar type, the result is the same as obj'Valid
      --
      --    For an array object, the result is True if the result of applying
      --    Valid_Scalars to every component is True. For an empty array the
      --    result is True.
      --
      --    For a record object, the result is True if the result of applying
      --    Valid_Scalars to every component is True. For class-wide types,
      --    only the components of the base type are checked. For variant
      --    records, only the components actually present are checked. The
      --    discriminants, if any, are also checked. If there are no components
      --    or discriminants, the result is True.
      --
      --    For any other type that has discriminants, the result is True if
      --    the result of applying Valid_Scalars to each discriminant is True.
      --
      --    For all other types, the result is always True
      --
      --  A warning is given for a trivially True result, when the attribute
      --  is applied to an object that is not of scalar, array, or record
      --  type, or in the composite case if no scalar subcomponents exist. For
      --  a variant record, the warning is given only if none of the variants
      --  have scalar subcomponents. In addition, the warning is suppressed
      --  for private types, or generic formal types in an instance.

      Attribute_Value_Size => True,
      --  Type'Value_Size is the number of bits required to represent value of
      --  the given subtype. It is the same as Type'Size, but, unlike Size, may
      --  be set for non-first subtypes. See section in Einfo ("Handling of
      --  type'Size values") for further details.

      ---------------

      Attribute_Word_Size => True,

      --  for constructing this definition in package System (see note above
      --  in Default_Bit_Order description). This is a static attribute.
