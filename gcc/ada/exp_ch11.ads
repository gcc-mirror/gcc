   procedure Expand_At_End_Handler (HSS : Node_Id; Blk_Id : Entity_Id);
   --  Given handled statement sequence HSS for which the At_End_Proc field
   --  is set, and which currently has no exception handlers, this procedure
   --  expands the special exception handler required. This procedure also
   --  create a new scope for the given block, if Blk_Id is not Empty.

   procedure Expand_Exception_Handlers (HSS : Node_Id);
   --  This procedure expands exception handlers, and is called as part
   --  of the processing for Expand_N_Handled_Sequence_Of_Statements and
   --  is also called from Expand_At_End_Handler. N is the handled sequence
   --  of statements that has the exception handler(s) to be expanded. This
   --  is also called to expand the special exception handler built for
   --  accept bodies (see Exp_Ch9.Build_Accept_Body).

   function Find_Local_Handler
     (Ename : Entity_Id;
      Nod   : Node_Id) return Node_Id;
   --  This function searches for a local exception handler that will handle
   --  the exception named by Ename. If such a local hander exists, then the
   --  corresponding N_Exception_Handler is returned. If no such handler is
   --  found then Empty is returned. In order to match and return True, the
   --  handler may not have a choice parameter specification. Nod is the raise
   --  node that references the handler.

   function Get_Local_Raise_Call_Entity return Entity_Id;
   --  This function is provided for use by the back end in conjunction with
   --  generation of Local_Raise calls when an exception raise is converted to
   --  a goto statement. If Local_Raise is defined, its entity is returned,
   --  if not, Empty is returned (in which case the call is silently skipped).

   function Get_RT_Exception_Entity (R : RT_Exception_Code) return Entity_Id;
   --  This function is provided for use by the back end in conjunction with
   --  generation of Local_Raise calls when an exception raise is converted to
   --  a goto statement. The argument is the reason code which would be used
   --  to determine which Rcheck_nn procedure to call. The returned result is
   --  the exception entity to be passed to Local_Raise.

   procedure Get_RT_Exception_Name (Code : RT_Exception_Code);
   --  This procedure is provided for use by the back end to obtain the name of
   --  the Rcheck procedure for Code. The name is appended to Namet.Name_Buffer
   --  without the __gnat_rcheck_ prefix.

   procedure Possible_Local_Raise (N : Node_Id; E : Entity_Id);
   --  This procedure is called whenever node N might cause the back end
   --  to generate a local raise for a local Constraint/Program/Storage_Error
   --  exception. It deals with generating a warning if there is no local
   --  handler (and restriction No_Exception_Propagation is set), or if there
   --  is a local handler marking that it has a local raise. E is the entity
   --  of the corresponding exception.

   procedure Warn_If_No_Local_Raise (N : Node_Id);
   --  Called for an exception handler that is not the target of a local raise.
   --  Issues warning if No_Exception_Propagation restriction is set. N is the
   --  node for the handler.
