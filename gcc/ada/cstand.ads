package CStand is

   procedure Create_Standard;
   --  This procedure creates the tree for package standard, and initializes
   --  the Standard_Entities array and Standard_Package_Node. First the
   --  syntactic representation is created (as though the parser had parsed
   --  a copy of the source of Standard) and then semantic information is
   --  added as it would be by the semantic phases of the compiler. The
   --  tree is in the standard format defined by Syntax_Info, except that
   --  all Sloc values are set to Standard_Location except for nodes that
   --  are part of package ASCII, which have Sloc = Standard_ASCII_Location.
   --  The semantics info is in the format given by Entity_Info. The global
   --  variables Last_Standard_Node_Id and Last_Standard_List_Id are also set.

   procedure Set_Float_Bounds (Id : Entity_Id);
   --  Procedure to set bounds for float type or subtype. Id is the entity
   --  whose bounds and type are to be set (a floating-point type).

end CStand;
