Specialized Needs Annexes
*************************

Ada 95, Ada 2005, Ada 2012, and Ada 2022 define a number of Specialized Needs Annexes, which are not required in all implementations.  However, as described in this chapter, GNAT implements all of these annexes:

*Systems Programming (Annex C)*
  The Systems Programming Annex is fully implemented.


*Real-Time Systems (Annex D)*
  The Real-Time Systems Annex is fully implemented.


*Distributed Systems (Annex E)*
  Stub generation is fully implemented in the GNAT compiler.  In addition,
  a complete compatible PCS is available as part of ``PolyORB``,
  a separate product. **NB!** See the note in :ref:`polyORB` regarding the lifetime of this product.


*Information Systems (Annex F)*
  The Information Systems annex is fully implemented.


*Numerics (Annex G)*
  The Numerics Annex is fully implemented.


*Safety and Security / High-Integrity Systems (Annex H)*
  The Safety and Security Annex (termed the High-Integrity Systems Annex
  in Ada 2005) is fully implemented.
