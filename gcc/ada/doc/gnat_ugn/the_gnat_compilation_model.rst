.. index:: Compilation model

This chapter describes the compilation model used by GNAT. Although
similar to that used by other languages such as C and C++, this model
is substantially different from the traditional Ada compilation models,
which are based on a centralized program library. The chapter covers
the following material:

.. _Source_Representation:

Source Representation
=====================

.. index:: Latin-1

.. index:: VT, HT, CR, LF, FF

Ada source programs are represented in standard text files, using
Latin-1 coding. Latin-1 is an 8-bit code that includes the familiar
7-bit ASCII set plus additional characters used for
representing foreign languages (see :ref:`Foreign_Language_Representation`
for support of non-USA character sets). The format effector characters
are represented using their standard ASCII encodings, as follows:

    =========== ======================= ===========
     Character          Effect           Code
    ----------- ----------------------- -----------
    :kbd:`VT`    Vertical tab            ``16#0B#``
    :kbd:`HT`    Horizontal tab          ``16#09#``
    :kbd:`CR`    Carriage return         ``16#0D#``
    :kbd:`LF`    Line feed               ``16#0A#``
    :kbd:`FF`    Form feed               ``16#0C#``
    =========== ======================= ===========

Source files are in standard text file format. In addition, GNAT
recognizes a wide variety of stream formats, in which the end of
physical lines is marked by any of the following sequences:
``LF``, ``CR``, ``CR-LF``, or ``LF-CR``. This is useful
in accommodating files imported from other operating systems.

.. index:: pair: End of source file; Source file, end

.. index:: SUB (control character)

The end of a source file is normally represented by the physical end of
file. However, the control character ``16#1A#`` (:kbd:`SUB`) is also
recognized as signalling the end of the source file. Again, this is
provided for compatibility with other, legacy, operating systems where this
code is used to represent the end of file.

.. index:: spec (definition), compilation (definition)

Each file contains a single Ada compilation unit, including any pragmas
associated with the unit. For example, this means you must place a
package declaration (a package *spec*) and the corresponding body in
separate files. An Ada *compilation* (which is a sequence of
compilation units) is represented using a sequence of files. Similarly,
you place each subunit or child unit in a separate file.

.. _Foreign_Language_Representation:

Foreign Language Representation
===============================

GNAT supports the standard character sets defined in Ada as well as
several other non-standard character sets for use in localized versions
of the compiler (:ref:`Character_Set_Control`).

.. _Latin-1:

Latin-1
-------

.. index:: Latin-1

The basic character set is Latin-1. This character set is defined by ISO
standard 8859, part 1. The lower half (character codes ``16#00#``
... ``16#7F#)`` is identical to standard ASCII coding but the upper
half is used to represent additional characters. These include extended letters
used by European languages, such as French accents, the vowels with umlauts
used in German, and the extra letter A-ring used in Swedish.

.. index:: Ada.Characters.Latin_1

For a complete list of Latin-1 codes and their encodings, see the source
file of library unit ``Ada.Characters.Latin_1`` in file
:file:`a-chlat1.ads`.
You may use any of these extended characters freely in character or
string literals. In addition, the extended characters that represent
letters can be used in identifiers.

.. _Other_8-Bit_Codes:

Other 8-Bit Codes
-----------------

GNAT also supports several other 8-bit coding schemes:


.. index:: Latin-2
.. index:: ISO 8859-2

*ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2)*
  Latin-2 letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and lowercase
  equivalence.

.. index:: Latin-3
.. index:: ISO 8859-3

*ISO 8859-3 (Latin-3)*
  Latin-3 letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and lowercase
  equivalence.


.. index:: Latin-4
.. index:: ISO 8859-4

*ISO 8859-4 (Latin-4)*
  Latin-4 letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and lowercase
  equivalence.


.. index:: ISO 8859-5
.. index:: Cyrillic

*ISO 8859-5 (Cyrillic)*
  ISO 8859-5 letters (Cyrillic) allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and
  lowercase equivalence.

.. index:: ISO 8859-15
.. index:: Latin-9

*ISO 8859-15 (Latin-9)*
  ISO 8859-15 (Latin-9) letters allowed in identifiers, with uppercase and
  lowercase equivalence.

.. index:: code page 437 (IBM PC)

*IBM PC (code page 437)*
  This code page is the normal default for PCs in the US. It corresponds
  to the original IBM PC character set. This set has some, but not all, of
  the extended Latin-1 letters, but these letters do not have the same
  encoding as Latin-1. In this mode, these letters are allowed in
  identifiers with uppercase and lowercase equivalence.

.. index:: code page 850 (IBM PC)

*IBM PC (code page 850)*
  This code page is a modification of 437 extended to include all the
  Latin-1 letters, but still not with the usual Latin-1 encoding. In this
  mode, all these letters are allowed in identifiers with uppercase and
  lowercase equivalence.


*Full Upper 8-bit*
  Any character in the range 80-FF is allowed in identifiers and all are
  considered distinct. In other words, there are no uppercase and lowercase
  equivalences in this range. This is useful in conjunction with
  certain encoding schemes used for some foreign character sets (e.g.,
  the typical method of representing Chinese characters on the PC).


*No Upper-Half*
  No upper-half characters in the range 80-FF are allowed in identifiers.
  This gives Ada 83 compatibility for identifier names.

For precise data on the encodings permitted, and the uppercase and lowercase
equivalences that are recognized, see the file :file:`csets.adb` in
the GNAT compiler sources. You will need to obtain a full source release
of GNAT to obtain this file.

.. _Wide_Character_Encodings:

Wide_Character Encodings
------------------------

GNAT allows wide character codes to appear in character and string
literals, and also optionally in identifiers, by means of the following
possible encoding schemes:

*Hex Coding*
  In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following five
  character sequence::

    ESC a b c d

  where ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d`` are the four hexadecimal
  characters (using uppercase letters) of the wide character code. For
  example, ESC A345 is used to represent the wide character with code
  ``16#A345#``.
  This scheme is compatible with use of the full Wide_Character set.

.. index:: Upper-Half Coding

*Upper-Half Coding*
  The wide character with encoding ``16#abcd#`` where the upper bit is on
  (in other words, 'a' is in the range 8-F) is represented as two bytes,
  ``16#ab#`` and ``16#cd#``. The second byte cannot be a format control
  character, but is not required to be in the upper half. This method can
  be also used for shift-JIS or EUC, where the internal coding matches the
  external coding.

.. index:: Shift JIS Coding

*Shift JIS Coding*
  A wide character is represented by a two-character sequence,
  ``16#ab#`` and
  ``16#cd#``, with the restrictions described for upper-half encoding as
  described above. The internal character code is the corresponding JIS
  character according to the standard algorithm for Shift-JIS
  conversion. You can only use characters defined in the JIS code set table
  with this encoding method.

.. index:: EUC Coding

*EUC Coding*
  A wide character is represented by a two-character sequence
  ``16#ab#`` and ``16#cd#``, with both characters being in the upper
  half. The internal character code is the corresponding JIS character
  according to the EUC encoding algorithm. You can only use characters
  defined in the JIS code set table with this encoding method.


*UTF-8 Coding*
  A wide character is represented using
  UCS Transformation Format 8 (UTF-8) as defined in Annex R of ISO
  10646-1/Am.2. Depending on the character value, the representation
  is a one, two, or three byte sequence::

    16#0000#-16#007f#: 2#0xxxxxxx#
    16#0080#-16#07ff#: 2#110xxxxx# 2#10xxxxxx#
    16#0800#-16#ffff#: 2#1110xxxx# 2#10xxxxxx# 2#10xxxxxx#

  where the ``xxx`` bits correspond to the left-padded bits of the
  16-bit character value. Note that all lower half ASCII characters
  are represented as ASCII bytes and all upper half characters and
  other wide characters are represented as sequences of upper-half
  (The full UTF-8 scheme allows for encoding 31-bit characters as
  6-byte sequences the use of these sequences is documented in the
  following section on wide wide characters.)


*Brackets Coding*
  In this encoding, a wide character is represented by the following eight
  character sequence::

    [ " a b c d " ]

  where ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d`` are the four hexadecimal characters
  (using uppercase letters) of the wide character code. For example,
  ['A345'] is used to represent the wide character with code
  ``16#A345#``. You can also (though you are not required to) use the
  Brackets coding for upper half characters. For example, you can
  represent the code ``16#A3#`` as ``['A3']``.

  This scheme is compatible with use of the full ``Wide_Character`` set,
  and is also the method used for wide character encoding in some standard
  ACATS (Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite) test suite distributions.

.. note::

  Some of these coding schemes do not permit the full use of the
  Ada character set. For example, neither Shift JIS nor EUC allow the
  use of the upper half of the Latin-1 set.

.. _Wide_Wide_Character_Encodings:

Wide_Wide_Character Encodings
-----------------------------

GNAT allows wide wide character codes to appear in character and string
literals, and also optionally in identifiers, by means of the following
possible encoding schemes:

*UTF-8 Coding*
  A wide character is represented using
  UCS Transformation Format 8 (UTF-8) as defined in Annex R of ISO
  10646-1/Am.2. Depending on the character value, the representation
  of character codes with values greater than 16#FFFF# is a
  is a four, five, or six byte sequence::

    16#01_0000#-16#10_FFFF#:     11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                 10xxxxxx
    16#0020_0000#-16#03FF_FFFF#: 111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
    16#0400_0000#-16#7FFF_FFFF#: 1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


  where the ``xxx`` bits correspond to the left-padded bits of the
  32-bit character value.

*Brackets Coding*
  In this encoding, a wide wide character is represented by the following ten or
  twelve byte character sequence::

    [ " a b c d e f " ]
    [ " a b c d e f g h " ]

  where ``a-h`` are the six or eight hexadecimal
  characters (using uppercase letters) of the wide wide character code. For
  example, ["1F4567"] is used to represent the wide wide character with code
  ``16#001F_4567#``.

  This scheme is compatible with use of the full ``Wide_Wide_Character`` set,
  and is also the method used for wide wide character encoding in some standard
  ACATS (Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite) test suite distributions.


.. _File_Naming_Topics_and_Utilities:

File Naming Topics and Utilities
================================

GNAT has a default file naming scheme, but and also provides you
with a high degree of control over how the names and extensions of your
source files correspond to the Ada compilation units that they
contain.


.. _File_Naming_Rules:

File Naming Rules
-----------------

GNAT determines the default file name by the name of the unit that the
file contains. The name is formed by taking the full expanded name of
the unit, replacing the separating dots with hyphens, and using
lowercase for all letters.

An exception occurs if the file name generated by the above rules starts
with one of the characters
``a``, ``g``, ``i``, or ``s`` and the second character is a
hyphen. In this case, the character tilde is used in place
of the hypen. This special rule avoids clashes with
the standard names for child units of the packages ``System``, ``Ada``,
``Interfaces``, and ``GNAT``, which use the prefixes
``s-``, ``a-``, ``i-``, and ``g-``,
respectively.

The file extension is :file:`.ads` for a spec and
:file:`.adb` for a body. The following table shows some
examples of these rules.

   ============================ ===============================
   Source File                   Ada Compilation Unit
   ---------------------------- -------------------------------
   :file:`main.ads`              Main (spec)
   :file:`main.adb`              Main (body)
   :file:`arith_functions.ads`   Arith_Functions (package spec)
   :file:`arith_functions.adb`   Arith_Functions (package body)
   :file:`func-spec.ads`         Func.Spec (child package spec)
   :file:`func-spec.adb`         Func.Spec (child package body)
   :file:`main-sub.adb`          Sub (subunit of Main)
   :file:`a~bad.adb`             A.Bad (child package body)
   ============================ ===============================

Following these rules can result in excessively long
file names if corresponding
unit names are long (for example, if child units or subunits are
heavily nested). An option is available to shorten such long file names
(called file name 'krunching'). You may find this particularly useful when
programs being developed with GNAT are to be used on operating systems
with limited file name lengths. :ref:`Using_gnatkr`.

Of course, no file shortening algorithm can guarantee uniqueness over
all possible unit names; if file name krunching is used, it is your
responsibility to ensure no name clashes occur. Alternatively, you
can specify the exact file names that you want used, as described
in the next section. Finally, if your Ada programs are migrating from a
compiler with a different naming convention, you can use the ``gnatchop``
utility to produce source files that follow the GNAT naming conventions.
(For details see :ref:`Renaming_Files_with_gnatchop`.)

Note: in the case of Windows or Mac OS operating systems, case is not
significant. So, for example, on Windows if the canonical name is
:file:`main-sub.adb`, you can use the file name :file:`Main-Sub.adb` instead.
However, case is significant for other operating systems, so, for example,
if you want to use other than canonically cased file names on a Unix system,
you need to follow the procedures described in the next section.

.. _Using_Other_File_Names:

Using Other File Names
----------------------

.. index:: File names

The previous section described the default rules used by
GNAT to determine the file name in which a given unit resides. It is
usually convenient to follow these default rules, and if you follow them,
the compiler knows without being explicitly told where to find all
the files it needs.

.. index:: Source_File_Name pragma

However, in some cases, particularly when a program is imported from
another Ada compiler environment, it may be more convenient for you
to specify which file names contain which units. GNAT allows
arbitrary file names to be used by means of the ``Source_File_Name`` pragma.
The form of this pragma is as shown in the following examples:

.. code-block:: ada

      pragma Source_File_Name (My_Utilities.Stacks,
        Spec_File_Name => "myutilst_a.ada");
      pragma Source_File_name (My_Utilities.Stacks,
        Body_File_Name => "myutilst.ada");

As shown in this example, the first argument for the pragma is the unit
name (in this example a child unit). The second argument has the form
of a named association. The identifier
indicates whether the file name is for a spec or a body;
the file name itself is given by a string literal.

The source file name pragma is a configuration pragma, which means that
normally you will place it in the :file:`gnat.adc`
file used to hold configuration
pragmas that apply to a complete compilation environment.
For more details on how the :file:`gnat.adc` file is created and used
see :ref:`Handling_of_Configuration_Pragmas`.

.. index:: gnat.adc

GNAT allows you to specify completely arbitrary file names using the
source file name pragma. However, if the file name specified has an
extension other than :file:`.ads` or :file:`.adb` you must use a
special syntax when compiling the file. The name on the command line
in this case must be preceded by the special sequence ``-x`` followed
by a space and the name of the language, here ``ada``, as in:

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gcc -c -x ada peculiar_file_name.sim

``gnatmake`` handles non-standard file names in the usual manner (the
non-standard file name for the main program is simply used as the
argument to ``gnatmake``). Note that if the extension is also non-standard,
you must include it in the ``gnatmake`` command; it may not
be omitted.

.. _Alternative_File_Naming_Schemes:

Alternative File Naming Schemes
-------------------------------

.. index:: File naming schemes, alternative

.. index:: File names

The previous section described the use of the ``Source_File_Name``
pragma to allow arbitrary names to be assigned to individual source files.
However, this approach requires one pragma for each file and, especially in
large systems, can result in very long :file:`gnat.adc` files, which can create
a maintenance problem.

.. index:: Source_File_Name pragma

GNAT also provides a facility for specifying systematic file naming schemes
other than the standard default naming scheme previously described. An
alternative scheme for naming is specified by the use of
``Source_File_Name`` pragmas having the following format:

.. code-block:: ada

     pragma Source_File_Name (
        Spec_File_Name  => FILE_NAME_PATTERN
      [ , Casing          => CASING_SPEC]
      [ , Dot_Replacement => STRING_LITERAL ] );

     pragma Source_File_Name (
        Body_File_Name  => FILE_NAME_PATTERN
      [ , Casing          => CASING_SPEC ]
      [ , Dot_Replacement => STRING_LITERAL ] ) ;

     pragma Source_File_Name (
        Subunit_File_Name  => FILE_NAME_PATTERN
      [ , Casing          => CASING_SPEC ]
      [ , Dot_Replacement => STRING_LITERAL ] ) ;

     FILE_NAME_PATTERN ::= STRING_LITERAL
     CASING_SPEC ::= Lowercase | Uppercase | Mixedcase

The ``FILE_NAME_PATTERN`` string shows how the file name is constructed.
It contains a single asterisk character, and the unit name is substituted
systematically for this asterisk. The optional parameter
``Casing`` indicates
whether the unit name is to be all upper-case letters, all lower-case letters,
or mixed-case. If no
``Casing`` parameter is used, the default is all
lower-case.

You use the optional ``Dot_Replacement`` string to replace any periods
that occur in subunit or child unit names. If you don't specify a
``Dot_Replacement`` argument, separating dots appear unchanged in the
resulting file name.  The above syntax indicates that the ``Casing``
argument must appear before the ``Dot_Replacement`` argument, but you
can write these arguments in any order.

As indicated, you can specify different naming schemes for
bodies, specs, and subunits. Quite often, the rule for subunits is the
same as the rule for bodies, in which case, you need not provide
a separate ``Subunit_File_Name`` rule; in this case the
``Body_File_name`` rule is used for subunits as well.

You can also use the separate rule for subunits to implement the rather
unusual case of a compilation environment (e.g., a single directory) which
contains a subunit and a child unit with the same unit name. Although
both units cannot appear in the same partition, the Ada Reference Manual
allows (but does not require) the possibility of the two units coexisting
in the same environment.

File name translation consists of the following steps:

* If there is a specific ``Source_File_Name`` pragma for the given unit,
  this is always used and any general pattern rules are ignored.

* If there is a pattern type ``Source_File_Name`` pragma that applies to
  the unit, the resulting file name is used if the file exists. If
  more than one pattern matches, the latest one is tried first and the
  first attempt that results in a reference to a file that exists is used.

* If no pattern type ``Source_File_Name`` pragma that applies to the unit
  for which the corresponding file exists, the standard GNAT default
  naming rules are used.

As an example of the use of this mechanism, consider a commonly used scheme
in which file names are all lower case, with separating periods copied
unchanged to the resulting file name, specs end with :file:`.1.ada`, and
bodies end with :file:`.2.ada`. GNAT will follow this scheme if the following
two pragmas appear:

.. code-block:: ada

     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Spec_File_Name => ".1.ada");
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Body_File_Name => ".2.ada");

The default GNAT scheme is equivalent to providing the following
default pragmas:

.. code-block:: ada

     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Spec_File_Name => ".ads", Dot_Replacement => "-");
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Body_File_Name => ".adb", Dot_Replacement => "-");

Our final example implements a scheme typically used with one of the
legacy Ada 83 compilers, where the separator character for subunits was '__'
(two underscores), specs were identified by adding :file:`_.ADA`, bodies
by adding :file:`.ADA`, and subunits by
adding :file:`.SEP`. All file names were
upper case. Child units were not present, of course, since this was an
Ada 83 compiler, but it seems reasonable to extend this scheme to use
the same double underscore separator for child units.

.. code-block:: ada

     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Spec_File_Name => "_.ADA",
        Dot_Replacement => "__",
        Casing = Uppercase);
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Body_File_Name => ".ADA",
        Dot_Replacement => "__",
        Casing = Uppercase);
     pragma Source_File_Name
       (Subunit_File_Name => ".SEP",
        Dot_Replacement => "__",
        Casing = Uppercase);

.. _Handling_Arbitrary_File_Naming_Conventions_with_gnatname:

Handling Arbitrary File Naming Conventions with ``gnatname``
------------------------------------------------------------

.. index:: File Naming Conventions

.. _Arbitrary_File_Naming_Conventions:

Arbitrary File Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GNAT compiler must know the source file name of a compilation unit
in order to compile it.  When using the standard GNAT default file
naming conventions (``.ads`` for specs, ``.adb`` for bodies), it
does not need additional information.

When the source file names do not follow the standard GNAT default
file naming conventions, you must give the GNAT compiler additional
information through a configuration pragmas file
(:ref:`Configuration_Pragmas`) or a project file.  When the
non-standard file naming conventions are well-defined, a small number
of pragmas ``Source_File_Name`` specifying a naming pattern
(:ref:`Alternative_File_Naming_Schemes`) may be sufficient. However,
if the file naming conventions are irregular or arbitrary, you must
define a number of pragma ``Source_File_Name`` for individual
compilation units.  To help maintain the correspondence between
compilation unit names and source file names within the compiler, GNAT
provides a tool ``gnatname`` to generate the required pragmas for a
set of files.

.. _Running_gnatname:

Running ``gnatname``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The usual form of the ``gnatname`` command is:

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatname [ switches ]  naming_pattern  [ naming_patterns ]
          [--and [ switches ]  naming_pattern  [ naming_patterns ]]


All of the arguments are optional. If invoked without any arguments,
``gnatname`` will display its usage.

When used with at least one naming pattern, ``gnatname`` attempts to
find all the compilation units in files that follow at least one of the
naming patterns. To find these compilation units,
``gnatname`` uses the GNAT compiler in syntax-check-only mode on all
regular files.

One or several *Naming Patterns* may be given as arguments to ``gnatname``.
Each Naming Pattern is enclosed between double quotes (or single
quotes on Windows).
A Naming Pattern is a regular expression similar to the wildcard patterns
used in file names by the Unix shells or the DOS prompt.

You may call ``gnatname`` with several sections of
directories/patterns.  Sections are separated by the switch
:switch:`--and`. In each section, you must include at least one
pattern. If you don't specify a directory a section, the current
directory (or the project directory if :switch:`-P` is used) is
used.  The options other that the directory switches and the
patterns apply globally even if they are in different sections.

Examples of Naming Patterns are::

     "*.[12].ada"
     "*.ad[sb]*"
     "body_*"    "spec_*"

For a more complete description of the syntax of Naming Patterns,
see the second kind of regular expressions described in :file:`g-regexp.ads`
(the 'Glob' regular expressions).

When invoked without the switch :switch:`-P`, ``gnatname`` will create a
configuration pragmas file :file:`gnat.adc` in the current working directory,
with pragmas ``Source_File_Name`` for each file that contains a valid Ada
unit.

.. _Switches_for_gnatname:

Switches for ``gnatname``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switches for ``gnatname`` must precede any specified Naming Pattern.

You may specify any of the following switches to ``gnatname``:

.. index:: --version (gnatname)

:switch:`--version`
  Display Copyright and version, then exit disregarding, all other options.

.. index:: --help (gnatname)

:switch:`--help`
  If :switch:`--version` was not used, display usage, then exit, disregarding
  all other options.

:switch:`--subdirs={dir}`
  Actual object, library or exec directories are subdirectories <dir> of the
  specified ones.

:switch:`--no-backup`
  Do not create a backup copy of an existing project file.

:switch:`--and`
  Start another section of directories/patterns.

.. index:: -c (gnatname)

:switch:`-c{filename}`
  Create a configuration pragmas file :file:`filename` (instead of the default
  :file:`gnat.adc`).
  There may be zero, one, or more space between :switch:`-c` and
  :file:`filename`.
  :file:`filename` may include directory information. :file:`filename` must be
  writable. You can specify only one switch :switch:`-c`.
  When a switch :switch:`-c` is
  specified, you may not specify switch :switch:`-P` (see below).

.. index:: -d (gnatname)

:switch:`-d{dir}`
  Look for source files in directory :file:`dir`. You may put zero, one or more
  spaces between :switch:`-d` and :file:`dir`.
  :file:`dir` may end with ``/**``, i.e., you may write it the form
  ``root_dir/**``. In this case, the directory ``root_dir`` and all of its
  subdirectories, recursively, have to be searched for sources.
  When you specify a :switch:`-d` switch,
  the current working directory will is not searched for source
  files unless you explicitly specify it with a :switch:`-d`
  or :switch:`-D` switch.
  You may specify several switches :switch:`-d`.
  If :file:`dir` is a relative path, it is relative to the directory of
  the configuration pragmas file specified with switch
  :switch:`-c`,
  or to the directory of the project file specified with switch
  :switch:`-P` or,
  if you don't specify either switch :switch:`-c`
  or switch :switch:`-P`, it's relative to the
  current working directory. The directory
  you specified with switch :switch:`-d` must exist and be readable.

.. index:: -D (gnatname)

:switch:`-D{filename}`
  Look for source files in all directories listed in text file :file:`filename`.
  You may place zero, one or more spaces between :switch:`-D`
  and :file:`filename`.
  :file:`filename` must be an existing, readable text file.
  Each nonempty line in :file:`filename` must be a directory.
  Specifying switch :switch:`-D` is equivalent to specifying as many
  switches :switch:`-d` as there are nonempty lines in
  :file:`file`.

:switch:`-eL`
  Follow symbolic links when processing project files.

  .. index:: -f (gnatname)

:switch:`-f{pattern}`
  Foreign patterns. Using this switch, you can add sources of languages
  other than Ada to the list of sources of a project file, but
  it's only useful if you also specify a :switch:`-P` switch.
  For example,

  .. code-block:: sh

     gnatname -Pprj -f"*.c" "*.ada"

  looks for Ada units in all files with the :file:`.ada` extension,
  and adds the C files with extension :file:`.c` to the list of file
  for project :file:`prj.gpr` .

  .. index:: -h (gnatname)

:switch:`-h`
  Output usage (help) information. The output is written to :file:`stdout`.

  .. index:: -P (gnatname)

:switch:`-P{proj}`

  Create or update project file :file:`proj`. You may place zero, one
  or more space between :switch:`-P` and :file:`proj`. :file:`proj`
  may include directory information. :file:`proj` must be writable.
  There may be only one switch :switch:`-P`.  When you specify switch
  :switch:`-P`, you may not also include switch :switch:`-c`.  On all
  platforms except VMS when ``gnatname`` is invoked for an existing
  project file :file:`<proj>.gpr``, ``gnatname`` creates a backup copy
  of the project file in the project directory with file name
  :file:`<proj>.gpr.saved_x` where ``x`` is the first non negative
  number that creates a unique filename.

  .. index:: -v (gnatname)

:switch:`-v`
  Verbose mode. Output detailed explanation of what it's doing to :file:`stdout`.
  This includes name of the file written, the name of the directories searched,
  and, for each file in those directories whose name matches at least one of
  the Naming Patterns, an indication of whether the file contains a unit,
  and, if so, the name of the unit.

.. index:: -v -v (gnatname)

:switch:`-v -v`
  Very verbose mode. In addition to the output produced in verbose mode
  (a single :switch:`-v` switch),
  for each file in the searched directories whose name matches none of
  the Naming Patterns, ``gnatname`` indicates that there is no match.

  .. index:: -x (gnatname)

:switch:`-x{pattern}`
  Excluded patterns. Using this switch, you can exclude some files
  that otherwise would match the name patterns. For example,

  .. code-block:: sh

      gnatname -x "*_nt.ada" "*.ada"

  looks for Ada units in all files with the :file:`.ada` extension,
  except those whose names end with :file:`_nt.ada`.


.. _Examples_of_gnatname_Usage:

Examples of ``gnatname`` Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatname -c /home/me/names.adc -d sources "[a-z]*.ada*"

In this example, the directory :file:`/home/me` must already exist
and be writable. In addition, the directory
:file:`/home/me/sources` (specified by
:switch:`-d sources`) must exist and be readable.

Note the optional spaces after :switch:`-c` and :switch:`-d`.

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatname -P/home/me/proj -x "*_nt_body.ada"
     -dsources -dsources/plus -Dcommon_dirs.txt "body_*" "spec_*"

Note that you may use several :switch:`-d` switches, even in
conjunction with one or several :switch:`-D` switches. This example
illustrates multiple Naming Patterns and one excluded pattern.


.. _File_Name_Krunching_with_gnatkr:

File Name Krunching with ``gnatkr``
-----------------------------------

.. index:: ! gnatkr

Here we discuss the method used by the compiler to shorten
the default file names chosen for Ada units so that they do not
exceed the maximum length permitted. We also describe the
``gnatkr`` utility, which you can use to determine the result of
applying this shortening.

.. _About_gnatkr:

About ``gnatkr``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GNAT requires that the file name must be derived from the unit
name. The default rule is as follows:

* Take the unit name and replace all dots by hyphens.

* If such a replacement occurs in the
  second character position of a name, and the first character is
  :samp:`a`, :samp:`g`, :samp:`s`, or :samp:`i`,
  then replace the dot by the character
  :samp:`~` (tilde)
  instead of a hyphen.

  This exception avoids clashes
  with the standard names for children of System, Ada, Interfaces,
  and GNAT, which use the prefixes
  :samp:`s-`, :samp:`a-`, :samp:`i-`, and :samp:`g-`,
  respectively.

The :switch:`-gnatk{nn}`
switch of the compiler activates a 'krunching'
circuit that limits file names to ``nn`` characters (where ``nn`` is a decimal
integer).

You can use the ``gnatkr`` utility to determine the krunched name for
a given file when krunched to a specified maximum length.

.. _Using_gnatkr:

Using ``gnatkr``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You invoke the ``gnatkr`` command as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatkr name [ length ]

``name`` is the uncrunched file name, derived from the name of the unit
in the default manner described in the previous section (i.e., in particular
all dots are replaced by hyphens). You may or may not include an
extension (defined as a suffix of the form period followed by arbitrary
characters other than period) in the filename. If you do, ``gnatkr`` will
preserve it in the output. For example, when krunching :file:`hellofile.ads`
to eight characters, the result will be :file:`hellofil.ads`.

Note: for compatibility with previous versions of ``gnatkr``, you can
use dots in the name instead of hyphens, but ``gnatkr`` always
interprets the last dot as the start of an extension. So if you pass ``gnatkr``
an argument such as :file:`Hello.World.adb`, it treats it
exactly as if the first period had been a hyphen, so, for
example, krunching to eight characters gives the result
:file:`hellworl.adb`.

Note that the result is always all lower case.  Other characters are
folded as required.

``length`` represents the length of the krunched name. The default
if you don't specify it, is 8 characters. A length of zero means
unlimited, in other words don't chop except for system files where the
implied crunching length is always eight characters.

The output is the krunched name. The output has an extension only if the
original argument was a file name with an extension.

.. _Krunching_Method:

Krunching Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial file name is determined by the name of the unit that the file
contains. The name is formed by taking the full expanded name of the
unit and replacing the separating dots with hyphens and
using lowercase
for all letters, except that a hyphen in the second character position is
replaced by a tilde if the first character is
:samp:`a`, :samp:`i`, :samp:`g`, or :samp:`s`.
The extension is ``.ads`` for a
spec and ``.adb`` for a body.
Krunching does not affect the extension, but the file name is shortened to
the specified length by following these rules:

* The name is divided into segments separated by hyphens, tildes, or
  underscores and all hyphens, tildes, and underscores are
  eliminated. If this leaves the name short enough, we are done.

* If the name is too long, the longest segment is located (left-most
  if there are two of equal length) and shortened by dropping
  its last character. This is repeated until the name is short enough.

  As an example, consider the krunching of :file:`our-strings-wide_fixed.adb`
  to fit the name into 8 characters, as required by some operating systems::

      our-strings-wide_fixed 22
      our strings wide fixed 19
      our string  wide fixed 18
      our strin   wide fixed 17
      our stri    wide fixed 16
      our stri    wide fixe  15
      our str     wide fixe  14
      our str     wid  fixe  13
      our str     wid  fix   12
      ou  str     wid  fix   11
      ou  st      wid  fix   10
      ou  st      wi   fix   9
      ou  st      wi   fi    8
      Final file name: oustwifi.adb

* The file names for all predefined units are always krunched to eight
  characters. The krunching of these predefined units uses the following
  special prefix replacements:

  ===================== ==============
  Prefix                 Replacement
  --------------------- --------------
  :file:`ada-`           :file:`a-`
  :file:`gnat-`          :file:`g-`
  :file:`interfac es-`   :file:`i-`
  :file:`system-`        :file:`s-`
  ===================== ==============

  These system files have a hyphen in the second character
  position. That's is why normal user files replace such a character
  with a tilde.

  As an example of this special rule, consider
  :file:`ada-strings-wide_fixed.adb`, which gets krunched as follows::

      ada-strings-wide_fixed 22
      a-  strings wide fixed 18
      a-  string  wide fixed 17
      a-  strin   wide fixed 16
      a-  stri    wide fixed 15
      a-  stri    wide fixe  14
      a-  str     wide fixe  13
      a-  str     wid  fixe  12
      a-  str     wid  fix   11
      a-  st      wid  fix   10
      a-  st      wi   fix   9
      a-  st      wi   fi    8
      Final file name: a-stwifi.adb

Of course, no file shortening algorithm can guarantee uniqueness over all
possible unit names. If file name krunching is used, it'is your
responsibility to ensure that no name clashes occur. The utility
program ``gnatkr`` is supplied so that you can conveniently determine the
krunched name of a file.

.. _Renaming_Files_with_gnatchop:

Renaming Files with ``gnatchop``
--------------------------------

.. index:: ! gnatchop

This section discusses how to handle files with multiple units by using
the ``gnatchop`` utility. You will also find this utility useful in renaming
files to meet the standard GNAT default file naming conventions.

.. _Handling_Files_with_Multiple_Units:

Handling Files with Multiple Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GNAT's fundamental compilation model requires that a file submitted to the
compiler contain only one unit and there be a strict correspondence
between the file name and the unit name.

If you want to have your files contain multiple units,
perhaps to maintain compatibility with some other Ada compilation system,
you can use ``gnatname`` to generate or update your project files, which
can be processed by GNAT.

See :ref:`Handling_Arbitrary_File_Naming_Conventions_with_gnatname`
for more details on how to use `gnatname`.

Alternatively, if you want to permanently restructure a set of
'foreign' files so that they match the GNAT rules, and do the
remaining development using the GNAT structure, you can simply use
``gnatchop`` once, generate the new set of files containing only one
unit per file, and work with them from that point on.

Note that if your file containing multiple units starts with a byte order
mark (BOM) specifying UTF-8 encoding, each file generated by gnatchop
will start with a copy of this BOM, meaning that they can be compiled
automatically in UTF-8 mode without you needing to specify an explicit encoding.

.. _Operating_gnatchop_in_Compilation_Mode:

Operating gnatchop in Compilation Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic function of ``gnatchop`` is to take a file with multiple units
and split it into separate files. The boundary between units is reasonably
clear, except for the issue of comments and pragmas. In default mode, the
rule is that any pragmas between units belong to the previous unit, except
that configuration pragmas always belong to the following unit. Any comments
belong to the following unit. These rules
almost always result in the right choice of
the split point without you needing to mark it explicitly and you'll likely
find this default to be what you want. In this default mode, you may not
submit a file containing only configuration pragmas, or one that ends in
configuration pragmas, to ``gnatchop``.

However, using a special switch to activate 'compilation mode',
``gnatchop``
can perform another function, which is to provide exactly the semantics
required by the RM for the handling of configuration pragmas in a compilation.
In the absence of configuration pragmas at the main file level, this
switch has no effect, but it causes such configuration pragmas to be handled
in a very different manner.

First, in compilation mode, if you give ``gnatchop`` a file that consists of
only configuration pragmas, it appends this file to the
:file:`gnat.adc` file in the current directory. This behavior provides
the required behavior described in the RM for the actions to be taken
on submitting such a file to the compiler, namely that these pragmas
should apply to all subsequent compilations in the same compilation
environment. Using GNAT, the current directory, possibly containing a
:file:`gnat.adc` file is the representation
of a compilation environment. For more information on the
:file:`gnat.adc` file, see :ref:`Handling_of_Configuration_Pragmas`.

Second, in compilation mode, if you give ``gnatchop`` a file that
starts with configuration pragmas and contains one or more units, then
configuration pragmas are prepended to each of the chopped
files. This behavior provides the required behavior described in the
RM for the actions to be taken on compiling such a file, namely that
the pragmas apply to all units in the compilation, but not to
subsequently compiled units.

Finally, if configuration pragmas appear between units, they are appended
to the previous unit. This results in the previous unit being illegal,
since the compiler does not accept configuration pragmas that follow
a unit. This provides the required RM behavior that forbids configuration
pragmas other than those preceding the first compilation unit of a
compilation.

For most purposes, you will use ``gnatchop``  in default mode. You only
use the compilation mode described above if you need precisely
accurate behavior with respect to compilations and you have files
that contain multiple units and configuration pragmas. In this
circumstance, the use of ``gnatchop`` with the compilation mode
switch provides the required behavior. This is the mode
in which GNAT processes the ACVC tests.


.. _Command_Line_for_gnatchop:

Command Line for ``gnatchop``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You call ``gnatchop`` as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatchop switches file_name [file_name ...]
           [directory]

The only required argument is the file name of the file to be chopped.
There are no restrictions on the form of this file name. The file itself
contains one or more Ada units, in normal GNAT format, concatenated
together. As shown, more than one file may be presented to be chopped.

When run in default mode, ``gnatchop`` generates one output file in
the current directory for each unit in each of the files.

``directory``, if specified, gives the name of the directory to which
the output files will be written. If you don't specify it, all files are
written to the current directory.

For example, given a
file called :file:`hellofiles` containing

.. code-block:: ada

     procedure Hello;

     with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
     procedure Hello is
     begin
        Put_Line ("Hello");
     end Hello;

the command

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatchop hellofiles

generates two files in the current directory, one called
:file:`hello.ads` containing the single line that is the procedure spec,
and the other called :file:`hello.adb` containing the remaining text. The
original file is not affected. You can compile these generated files in
the normal manner.

When you invoke ``gnatchop`` on a file that is empty or contains only
empty lines and/or comments, ``gnatchop`` will complete normally, but
won't produce any new file.

For example, given a
file called :file:`toto.txt` containing

.. code-block:: ada

     --  Just a comment

the command

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatchop toto.txt

will not produce any new file and will result in the following warnings::

     toto.txt:1:01: warning: empty file, contains no compilation units
     no compilation units found
     no source files written


.. _Switches_for_gnatchop:

Switches for ``gnatchop``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``gnatchop`` recognizes the following switches:


.. index:: --version (gnatchop)

:switch:`--version`
  Display copyright and version, then exit, disregarding all other options.

.. index:: --help (gnatchop)

:switch:`--help`
  If :switch:`--version` is not present, display usage, then exit, disregarding
  all other options.

.. index:: -c (gnatchop)

:switch:`-c`
  Causes ``gnatchop`` to operate in compilation mode, in which
  configuration pragmas are handled according to strict RM rules. See the
  previous section for a full description of this mode.

:switch:`-gnat{xxx}`
  This passes the given :switch:`-gnat{xxx}` switch to ``gcc`` which is
  used to parse the given file. Not all *xxx* options make sense,
  but, for example, the use of :switch:`-gnati2` allows ``gnatchop`` to
  process a source file that uses Latin-2 coding for identifiers.

:switch:`-h`
  Causes ``gnatchop`` to generate a brief help summary to the standard
  output file showing usage information.

.. index:: -k (gnatchop)

:switch:`-k{mm}`

  Limit generated file names to the specified number ``mm`` of
  characters.  This is useful if the resulting set of files is
  required to be interoperable with systems which limit the length of
  file names.  You may not place any space between the :switch:`-k`
  and the numeric value. You can omit the numeric value, in which case
  ``gnatchop`` will use a default of :switch:`-k8`, suitable for use
  with DOS-like file systems. If you don't specify a :switch:`-k` switch,
  there is no limit on the length of file names.

.. index:: -p (gnatchop)

:switch:`-p`
  Causes the file modification time stamp of the input file to be
  preserved and used for the time stamp of the output file(s). You may find this
  useful for preserving coherency of time stamps in an environment where
  ``gnatchop`` is used as part of a standard build process.

.. index:: -q (gnatchop)

:switch:`-q`
  Causes output of informational messages indicating the set of generated
  files to be suppressed. Warnings and error messages are unaffected.

.. index:: -r (gnatchop)
.. index:: Source_Reference pragmas

:switch:`-r`
  Generate ``Source_Reference`` pragmas. Use this switch if the output
  files are regarded as temporary and development is to be done from
  of the original unchopped file. This switch causes
  ``Source_Reference`` pragmas to be inserted into each of the
  generated files to refer back to the original file name and line number.
  The result is that all error messages refer back to the original
  unchopped file.
  In addition, the debugging information placed into the object file (when
  the :switch:`-g` switch of ``gcc`` or ``gnatmake`` is
  specified)
  also refers back to this original file so that tools like profilers and
  debuggers will give information in terms of the original unchopped file.

  If the original file to be chopped itself contains
  a ``Source_Reference``
  pragma referencing a third file, ``gnatchop`` respects these
  pragmas and the generated ``Source_Reference`` pragmas
  in the chopped file refer to the original file, with appropriate
  line numbers. This is particularly useful when ``gnatchop``
  is used in conjunction with ``gnatprep`` to compile files that
  contain preprocessing statements and multiple units.

.. index:: -v (gnatchop)

:switch:`-v`
  Causes ``gnatchop`` to operate in verbose mode. It outputs the
  version number and copyright notice as well as exact copies of the
  commands spawned to obtain the information needed to control chopping.

.. index:: -w (gnatchop)

:switch:`-w`
  Overwrite existing file names. Normally, ``gnatchop`` treats it as a
  fatal error if there's already a file with the same name as a
  file it would otherwise output. This can happen either if you've previously
  chopped that file or if the files to be
  chopped contain duplicated units. This switch bypasses this
  check and causes all but the last instance of such duplicated
  units to be skipped.

.. index:: --GCC= (gnatchop)

:switch:`--GCC={xxxx}`
  Specify the path of the GNAT parser to be used. When this switch is used,
  ``gnatchop`` makes no attempt to add a prefix to the GNAT parser executable,
  so it must include the full pathname.


.. _Examples_of_gnatchop_Usage:

Examples of ``gnatchop`` Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatchop -w hello_s.ada prerelease/files

Chops the source file :file:`hello_s.ada`. The output files are
placed in the directory :file:`prerelease/files`,
overwriting any
files with matching names in that directory (no files in the current
directory are modified).

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatchop archive

Chops the source file :file:`archive`
into the current directory. One
useful application of ``gnatchop`` is in sending sets of sources
around, for example in email messages. The required sources are simply
concatenated (for example, using a Unix ``cat``
command) and
``gnatchop`` is used at the other end to reconstitute the original
files.

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatchop file1 file2 file3 direc

Chops all units in files :file:`file1`, :file:`file2`, :file:`file3`,
placing the resulting files in the directory :file:`direc`. Note that
if any units occur more than once anywhere within this set of files,
``gnatchop`` generates an error message, and doesn't write any
files. To override this check, use the :switch:`-w` switch, in which
case the last occurrence in the last file will be the one that is
output and ``gnatchop`` will skip earlier duplicate occurrences for
the same unit.

.. _Configuration_Pragmas:

Configuration Pragmas
=====================

.. index:: Configuration pragmas

.. index:: Pragmas, configuration

Configuration pragmas supported by GNAT consist of those pragmas described as
such in the Ada Reference Manual and the
implementation-dependent pragmas that are configuration pragmas.
See the ``Implementation_Defined_Pragmas`` chapter in the
:title:`GNAT_Reference_Manual` for details on these
additional GNAT-specific configuration pragmas.
Most notably, the pragma ``Source_File_Name``, which allows
specifying non-default names for source files, is a configuration
pragma. The following is a complete list of configuration pragmas

.. _Handling_of_Configuration_Pragmas:

Handling of Configuration Pragmas
---------------------------------

You can place configuration pragmas either appear at the start of a compilation
unit or in a configuration pragma file that applies to
all compilations performed in a given compilation environment.

Configuration pragmas placed before a library level package specification
are not propagated to the corresponding package body (see RM 10.1.5(8));
they must be added explicitly to the package body.

GNAT includes the ``gnatchop`` utility to provide an automatic
way to handle configuration pragmas that follows the semantics for
compilations (that is, files with multiple units) described in the RM.
See :ref:`Operating_gnatchop_in_Compilation_Mode` for details.
However, for most purposes, you will find it more convenient to edit the
:file:`gnat.adc` file that contains configuration pragmas directly,
as described in the following section.

In the case of ``Restrictions`` pragmas appearing as configuration
pragmas in individual compilation units, the exact handling depends on
the type of restriction.

Restrictions that require partition-wide consistency (like
``No_Tasking``) are
recognized wherever they appear
and can be freely inherited, e.g. from a |withed| unit to the |withing|
unit. This makes sense since the binder will always insist on seeing
consistent us, so any unit not conforming to any restrictions
anywhere in the partition will be rejected and it's better for you to find
that out at compile time rather than bind time.

For restrictions that do not require partition-wide consistency, e.g.
``SPARK`` or ``No_Implementation_Attributes``, the restriction
normally applies only to the unit in which the pragma appears, and not
to any other units.

The exception is ``No_Elaboration_Code``, which always applies to the
entire object file from a compilation, i.e. to the body, spec, and all
subunits.  You can apply this restriction in a configuration pragma
file or you can ace it in the body and/or the spec (in either case it
applies to all the relevant units). You can place it on a subunit only if
you have previously placed it in the body of spec.


.. _The_Configuration_Pragmas_Files:

The Configuration Pragmas Files
-------------------------------

.. index:: gnat.adc

In GNAT, a compilation environment is defined by the current directory
at the time that a compile command is given. This current directory is
searched for a file whose name is :file:`gnat.adc`. If this file is
present, it is expected to contain one or more configuration pragmas
that will be applied to the current compilation.  However, if you
specify the switch :switch:`-gnatA`, GNAT ignores
:file:`gnat.adc`. When used, GNAT adds :file:`gnat.adc` to the
dependencies so that if :file:`gnat.adc` is modified later, the source
will be recompiled on a future invocation of ``gnatmake``.

You can add
configuration pragmas into the :file:`gnat.adc` file
either by running ``gnatchop`` on a source file consisting only of
configuration pragmas or, more conveniently, by directly editing the
:file:`gnat.adc` file, which is a standard format source file.

Besides :file:`gnat.adc`, you may apply additional files containing
configuration pragmas to the current compilation using the
:switch:`-gnatec={path}` switch, where ``path`` must designate an
existing file that contains only configuration pragmas. These
configuration pragmas are in addition to those found in
:file:`gnat.adc` (provided :file:`gnat.adc` is present and you do not
use switch :switch:`-gnatA`).
You can specify multiple :switch:`-gnatec=`  switches.

GNAT will add files containing configuration pragmas specified with switches
:switch:`-gnatec=` to the dependencies, unless they are
temporary files. A file is considered temporary if its name ends in
:file:`.tmp` or :file:`.TMP`. Certain tools follow this naming
convention because they pass information to ``gcc`` via
temporary files that are immediately deleted; it doesn't make sense to
depend on a file that no longer exists. Such tools include
``gprbuild``, ``gnatmake``, and ``gnatcheck``.

By default, configuration pragma files are stored by their absolute
paths in ALI files. You can use the :switch:`-gnateb` switch to
request they be stored instead by just their basename.

If you are using project file, they provide a separate mechanism using
project attributes.

   See :ref:`Specifying_Configuration_Pragmas` for more details.


.. _Generating_Object_Files:

Generating Object Files
=======================

An Ada program consists of a set of source files and the first step in
compiling the program is generating the corresponding object files.
You generate these by compiling a subset of these source files.
The files you need to compile are the following:

* If a package spec has no body, compile the package spec to produce the
  object file for the package.

* If a package has both a spec and a body, compile the body to produce
  the object file for the package. You need not compile the source
  file for the package spec in this case because there's only one
  object file, which contains the code for both the spec and body of
  the package.

* For a subprogram, compile the subprogram body to produce the object
  file for the subprogram. You need not compile the spec, if such a file is
  present.

.. index:: Subunits

* In the case of subunits, only compile the parent unit. GNAT
  generates a single object file for the entire subunit tree, which
  includes all the subunits.

* Compile child units independently of their parent units (though, of
  course, the spec of all the ancestor unit must be present in order
  to compile a child unit).

  .. index:: Generics

* Compile generic units in the same manner as any other units. The
  object files in this case are small dummy files that contain, at
  most, the flag used for elaboration checking. This is because GNAT
  always handles generic instantiation by means of macro
  expansion. However, you still must compile generic units
  for dependency checking and elaboration purposes.

The preceding rules describe the set of files that must be compiled to
generate all the object files for a program. See the following section on dependencies for more details on computing that set of files.
Each object file has the same
name as the corresponding source file, except that the extension is
:file:`.o`, as usual.

You may wish to compile other files for the purpose of checking their
syntactic and semantic correctness. For example, in the case where a
package has a separate spec and body, you would not normally compile the
spec. However, it is convenient in practice to compile the spec to make
sure it is error-free before compiling clients of this spec because such
compilations will fail if there is an error in the spec.

GNAT provides an option for compiling such files purely for the
purposes of checking correctness; such compilations are not required as
part of the process of building a program. To compile a file in this
checking mode, use the :switch:`-gnatc` switch.

.. _Source_Dependencies:

Source Dependencies
===================

Each object file obviously depends on at least the source file which
is compiled to produce it. Here we are using "depends" in the sense of
a typical ``make`` utility; in other words, an object file depends on
a source file if changes to the source file require the object file to
be recompiled.  In addition to this basic dependency, a given object
may depend on additional source files as follows:

* If a file being compiled |withs| a unit ``X``, the object file
  depends on the file containing the spec of unit ``X``. This includes
  files that are |withed| implicitly either because they are parents
  of |withed| child units or are run-time units required by the
  language constructs used in a particular unit.

* If a file being compiled instantiates a library level generic unit, the
  object file depends on both the spec and body files for this generic
  unit.

* If a file being compiled instantiates a generic unit defined within a
  package, the object file depends on the body file for the package as
  well as the spec file.

.. index:: Inline
.. index:: -gnatn switch

* If a file being compiled contains a call to a subprogram for which
  pragma ``Inline`` applies and you have activated inlining with the
  :switch:`-gnatn` switch, the object file depends on the file containing the
  body of this subprogram as well as on the file containing the spec. Note
  that for inlining to actually occur as a result of the use of this switch,
  you must compile in optimizing mode.

  .. index:: -gnatN switch

  The use of :switch:`-gnatN` activates  inlining optimization
  that is performed by the front end of the compiler. This inlining does
  not require that the code generation be optimized. Like :switch:`-gnatn`,
  the use of this switch generates additional dependencies.

  When using a ``gcc`` or LLVM based back end, the use of
  :switch:`-gnatN` is deprecated and the use of :switch:`-gnatn` is preferred.
  Historically front end inlining was more extensive than back end
  inlining, but that is no longer the case.

* If an object file :file:`O` depends on the proper body of a subunit through
  inlining or instantiation, it depends on the parent unit of the subunit.
  This means that any modification of the parent unit or one of its subunits
  affects the compilation of :file:`O`.

* The object file for a parent unit depends on all its subunit body files.

* The previous two rules means that, for purposes of computing
  dependencies and recompilation, a body and all its subunits are
  treated as an indivisible whole.

  These rules are applied transitively: if unit ``A`` |withs|
  unit ``B``, whose elaboration calls an inlined procedure in package
  ``C``, the object file for unit ``A`` depends on the body of
  ``C``, in file :file:`c.adb`.

  The set of dependent files described by these rules includes all the
  files on which the unit is semantically dependent, as dictated by the
  Ada language standard. However, it is a superset of what the
  standard describes, because it includes generic, inline, and subunit
  dependencies.

  An object file must be recreated by recompiling the corresponding
  source file if any of the source files on which it depends are
  modified. For example, if the ``make`` utility is used to control
  compilation, the rule for an Ada object file must mention all the
  source files on which the object file depends, according to the
  above definition.  Invoking ``gnatmake`` will cause it to determine
  the necessary recompilations.

.. _The_Ada_Library_Information_Files:

The Ada Library Information Files
=================================

.. index:: Ada Library Information files

.. index:: ALI files

Each compilation actually generates two output files. The first of these
is the actual object file that has a :file:`.o` extension. The second is a
text file containing full dependency information. It has the same
name as the source file, but an :file:`.ali` extension.
This file is known as the Ada Library Information (:file:`ALI`) file.
The following information is contained in that file:

* Version information (indicates which version of GNAT was used to compile
  the unit(s) in question)

* Main program information (including priority and time slice settings,
  as well as the wide character encoding used during compilation).

* List of arguments used in the compilation command

* Attributes of the unit, including the configuration pragmas used, an
  indication of whether the compilation was successful, and the exception
  model used.

* A list of relevant restrictions applying to the unit (used for consistency
  checking).

* Categorization information (e.g., use of pragma ``Pure``).

* Information on all |withed| units, including presence of
  ``Elaborate`` or ``Elaborate_All`` pragmas.

* Information from any ``Linker_Options`` pragmas used in the unit

* Information on the use of ``Body_Version`` or ``Version``
  attributes in the unit.

* Dependency information. This is a list of files, together with
  time stamp and checksum information. These are files on which
  the unit depends in the sense that the modification of any of
  these units requires the recompilation of the unit in question.

* Cross-reference data. Contains information on all entities referenced
  in the unit. Used by some tools to provide cross-reference information.

For a full detailed description of the format of the :file:`ALI` file,
see the source of the spec of unit ``Lib.Writ``, contained in file
:file:`lib-writ.ads` in the GNAT compiler sources.


.. _Binding_an_Ada_Program:

Binding an Ada Program
======================

When using languages such as C and C++, once the source files have been
compiled the only remaining step in building an executable program
is linking the object modules together. This means that you can
link an inconsistent version of a program, in which two units have
included different versions of the same header.

The rules of Ada do not permit such an inconsistent program to be built.
For example, if two clients have different versions of the same package,
it is illegal to build a program containing these two clients.
These rules are enforced by the GNAT binder, which also determines an
elaboration order consistent with the Ada rules.

The GNAT binder is run after all the object files for a program have
been created. It is given the name of the main program unit and from
this determines the set of units required by the program by reading the
corresponding ALI files. It generates error messages if the program is
inconsistent or if no valid order of elaboration exists.

If no errors are detected, the binder produces a main program in Ada
that contains calls to the elaboration procedures of those
compilation unit that require them, followed by
a call to the main program. This Ada program is compiled to generate the
object file for the main program. The name of
the Ada file is :file:`b~xxx.adb` (with the corresponding spec
:file:`b~xxx.ads`) where ``xxx`` is the name of the
main program unit.

Finally, the linker is used to build the resulting executable program,
using the object from the main program from the bind step as well as the
object files for the Ada units of the program.


.. _GNAT_and_Libraries:

GNAT and Libraries
==================

.. index:: Library building and referencing

This section describes how to build and use libraries with GNAT and
how to recompile the GNAT run-time library. You should be familiar with the
Project Manager facility (see the *GNAT_Project_Manager* chapter of the
:title:`GPRbuild User's Guide`) before reading this chapter.

.. _Introduction_to_Libraries_in_GNAT:

Introduction to Libraries in GNAT
---------------------------------

A library is, conceptually, a collection of objects which does not have its
own main thread of execution but instead provides certain services to the
applications that use it. A library can be either statically linked with the
application, in which case its code is directly included in the application,
or, on platforms that support it, be dynamically linked, in which case
its code is shared by all applications making use of this library.

GNAT supports both types of libraries.
In the static case, you can provide the compiled code in different ways. The
simplest approach is to directly provide the set of objects resulting from
compilation of the library source files. Alternatively, you can group the
objects into an archive using whatever commands are provided by the operating
system.

In the GNAT environment, a library has these components:

*  Source files,

*  :file:`ALI` files (see :ref:`The_Ada_Library_Information_Files`), and

*  Object files, an archive, or a shared library.

A GNAT library may expose all its source files, which is useful for
documentation purposes. Alternatively, it may expose only the units needed by
an external user to make use of the library, in other words, the specs
reflecting the library services along with all the units needed to compile
those specs, which can include generic bodies or any body implementing an
inlined routine. In the case of *stand-alone libraries* those exposed
units are called *interface units* (:ref:`Stand-alone_Ada_Libraries`).

All compilation units comprising an application, including those in a library,
need to be elaborated in an order partially defined by Ada's semantics. GNAT
computes the elaboration order from the :file:`ALI` files and this is why they
constitute a mandatory part of GNAT libraries.
*Stand-alone libraries* are the exception to this rule because a specific
library elaboration routine is produced independently of the application(s)
using the library.

.. _General_Ada_Libraries:

General Ada Libraries
---------------------


.. _Building_a_library:

Building a library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to build a library is to use the Project Manager,
which supports a special type of project called a *Library Project*
(see the *Library Projects* section in the *GNAT Project Manager*
chapter of the :title:`GPRbuild User's Guide`).

A project is considered a library project when two project-level
attributes are defined in it: ``Library_Name`` and ``Library_Dir``. In
order to control different aspects of library configuration, you can
specify additional optional project-level attributes:

* ``Library_Kind``
    This attribute controls whether the library is to be static or dynamic

* ``Library_Version``
    This attribute specifies the library version. Its value is used
    during dynamic linking of shared libraries to determine if the currently
    installed versions of the binaries are compatible.

* ``Library_Options``

* ``Library_GCC``
    These attributes specify additional low-level options to be used during
    library generation and the commands used to generate the
    library.

The GNAT Project Manager takes complete care of the library maintenance task,
including recompilation of the source files for which objects do not exist
or are not up to date, assembly of the library archive, and installation of
the library (i.e., copying associated source, object and :file:`ALI` files
to the specified location).

Here's a simple library project file:

.. code-block:: gpr

       project My_Lib is
         for Source_Dirs use ("src1", "src2");
         for Object_Dir use "obj";
         for Library_Name use "mylib";
         for Library_Dir use "lib";
         for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
       end My_lib;

and the compilation command to build and install the library:

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatmake -Pmy_lib

It's complex to manually perform all the steps required to
produce a library, so we recommend you use the GNAT Project Manager
for this task. In case this is not desired, we discuss the necessary
steps below.

There are various possibilities for compiling the units that make up
the library: for example with a :file:`Makefile`
(:ref:`Using_the_GNU_make_Utility`) or with a conventional script. For
simple libraries, you can also create a dummy main program
that depends upon all the packages that comprise the interface of the
library. You can then pass this dummy main program to ``gnatmake``,
which will ensure all necessary objects are built.

After the above has been accomplished, you should follow the standard procedure
of the underlying operating system to produce the static or shared library.

Here's an example of such a dummy program:

.. code-block:: ada

       with My_Lib.Service1;
       with My_Lib.Service2;
       with My_Lib.Service3;
       procedure My_Lib_Dummy is
       begin
          null;
       end;

Here are the generic commands that will build an archive or a shared library.

.. code-block:: sh

     # compiling the library
     $ gnatmake -c my_lib_dummy.adb

     # we don't need the dummy object itself
     $ rm my_lib_dummy.o my_lib_dummy.ali

     # create an archive with the remaining objects
     $ ar rc libmy_lib.a *.o
     # some systems may require "ranlib" to be run as well

     # or create a shared library
     $ gcc -shared -o libmy_lib.so *.o
     # some systems may require the code to have been compiled with -fPIC

     # remove the object files that are now in the library
     $ rm *.o

     # Make the ALI files read-only so that gnatmake will not try to
     # regenerate the objects that are in the library
     $ chmod -w *.ali

Please note that the library must have a name of the form :file:`lib{xxx}.a`
or :file:`lib{xxx}.so` (or :file:`lib{xxx}.dll` on Windows) in order to
be accessed by the :switch:`-l{xxx}` switch at link time.

.. _Installing_a_library:

Installing a library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: ADA_PROJECT_PATH
.. index:: GPR_PROJECT_PATH

If you use project files, library installation is part of the library build
process (see the *Installing a Library with Project Files* section of the
*GNAT Project Manager* chapter of the :title:`GPRbuild User's Guide`).

When you're not able to use project files for some reason, you can
also install the library so that the sources needed to use the library
are on the Ada source path and the ALI files & libraries be on the Ada
Object path (see :ref:`Search_Paths_and_the_Run-Time_Library_RTL`),
but we don't recommend doing this.  Alternatively, the system
administrator can place general-purpose libraries in the default
compiler paths, by specifying the libraries' location in the
configuration files :file:`ada_source_path` and
:file:`ada_object_path`. These configuration files must be located in
the GNAT installation tree at the same place as the ``gcc`` spec
file. The location of the ``gcc`` spec file can be determined as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gcc -v


The configuration files mentioned above have a simple format: each line
must contain one unique directory name.
Those names are added to the corresponding path
in their order of appearance in the file. The names can be either absolute
or relative; in the latter case, they are relative to where theses files
are located.

The files :file:`ada_source_path` and :file:`ada_object_path` might not be
present in a
GNAT installation, in which case, GNAT looks for its run-time library in
the directories :file:`adainclude` (for the sources) and :file:`adalib` (for the
objects and :file:`ALI` files). When the files exist, the compiler does not
look in :file:`adainclude` and :file:`adalib`, and thus the
:file:`ada_source_path` file
must contain the location for the GNAT run-time sources (which can simply
be :file:`adainclude`). In the same way, the :file:`ada_object_path` file must
contain the location for the GNAT run-time objects (which can simply
be :file:`adalib`).

You can also specify a new default path to the run-time library at
compilation time with the :switch:`--RTS=rts-path` switch. You can
thus choose the run-time library you want your program to be
compiled with. This switch is recognized by ``gcc``, ``gnatmake``,
``gnatbind``, ``gnatls``, and all project aware tools.

You can install a library before or after the standard GNAT library by
selecting the ordering the lines in the configuration files. In
general, a library must be installed before the GNAT library if it
redefines any part of it.

.. _Using_a_library:

Using a library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once again, the project facility greatly simplifies the use of
libraries. In this context, using a library is just a matter of adding a
|with| clause in your project. For example, to make use of the
library ``My_Lib`` shown in examples in earlier sections, you can
write:

.. code-block:: gpr

       with "my_lib";
       project My_Proj is
         ...
       end My_Proj;

Even if you have a third-party, non-Ada library, you can still use GNAT's
Project Manager facility to provide a wrapper for it. For example, the
following project, when |withed| by your main project, will link with the
third-party library :file:`liba.a`:

.. code-block:: gpr

       project Liba is
          for Externally_Built use "true";
          for Source_Files use ();
          for Library_Dir use "lib";
          for Library_Name use "a";
          for Library_Kind use "static";
       end Liba;

This is an alternative to the use of ``pragma Linker_Options``. It is
especially interesting in the context of systems with several interdependent
static libraries where finding a proper linker order is not easy and best be
left to the tools having visibility over project dependence information.

In order to use an Ada library manually, you need to make sure that this
library is on both your source and object path
(see :ref:`Search_Paths_and_the_Run-Time_Library_RTL`
and :ref:`Search_Paths_for_gnatbind`). Furthermore, when the objects are grouped
in an archive or a shared library, you need to specify the desired
library at link time.

For example, you can use the library :file:`mylib` installed in
:file:`/dir/my_lib_src` and :file:`/dir/my_lib_obj` with the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatmake -aI/dir/my_lib_src -aO/dir/my_lib_obj my_appl \\
       -largs -lmy_lib

This can be expressed more simply:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ gnatmake my_appl

when the following conditions are met:

* :file:`/dir/my_lib_src` has been added by the user to the environment
  variable :envvar:`ADA_INCLUDE_PATH`, or by the administrator to the file
  :file:`ada_source_path`

* :file:`/dir/my_lib_obj` has been added by the user to the environment
  variable :envvar:`ADA_OBJECTS_PATH`, or by the administrator to the file
  :file:`ada_object_path`

* a pragma ``Linker_Options`` has been added to one of the sources.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: ada

       pragma Linker_Options ("-lmy_lib");

Note that you may also load a library dynamically at
run time given its filename, as illustrated in the GNAT :file:`plugins` example
in the directory :file:`share/examples/gnat/plugins` within the GNAT
install area.

.. _Stand-alone_Ada_Libraries:

Stand-alone Ada Libraries
-------------------------

.. index:: ! Stand-alone libraries

.. _Introduction_to_Stand-alone_Libraries:

Introduction to Stand-alone Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Stand-alone Library (abbreviated 'SAL') is a library that contains
the necessary code to elaborate the Ada units that are included in the
library. In contrast with an ordinary library, which consists of all
sources, objects and :file:`ALI` files of the library, a SAL may
specify a restricted subset of compilation units to serve as a library
interface. In this case, the fully self-sufficient set of files will
normally consist of an objects archive, the sources of interface
units' specs, and the :file:`ALI` files of interface units.  If an
interface spec contains a generic unit or an inlined subprogram, you
must also provide the body's source; if the units that must be
provided in the source form depend on other units, you must also
provide the source and :file:`ALI` files of those units.

The main purpose of a SAL is to minimize the recompilation overhead of client
applications when a new version of the library is installed. Specifically,
if the interface sources have not changed, client applications don't need to
be recompiled. If, furthermore, a SAL is provided in the shared form and its
version, controlled by ``Library_Version`` attribute, is not changed,
the clients also do not need to be relinked.

SALs also allow the library providers to minimize the amount of library source
text exposed to the clients.  Such 'information hiding' might be useful or
necessary for various reasons.

Stand-alone libraries are also well suited to be used in an executable whose
main routine is not written in Ada.

.. _Building_a_Stand-alone_Library:

Building a Stand-alone Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GNAT's Project facility provides a simple way of building and installing
stand-alone libraries; see the *Stand-alone Library Projects* section
in the *GNAT Project Manager* chapter of the :title:`GPRbuild User's Guide`.
To be a Stand-alone Library Project, in addition to the two attributes
that make a project a Library Project (``Library_Name`` and
``Library_Dir``; see the *Library Projects* section in the
*GNAT Project Manager* chapter of the *GPRbuild User's Guide*),
you must define the attribute ``Library_Interface``.  For example:

.. code-block:: gpr

       for Library_Dir use "lib_dir";
       for Library_Name use "dummy";
       for Library_Interface use ("int1", "int1.child");

Attribute ``Library_Interface`` has a non-empty string list value,
each string in the list designating a unit contained in an immediate source
of the project file.

When a Stand-alone Library is built, the binder is first invoked to build
a package whose name depends on the library name
(:file:`b~dummy.ads/b` in the example above).
This binder-generated package includes initialization and
finalization procedures whose
names depend on the library name (``dummyinit`` and ``dummyfinal``
in the example
above). The object corresponding to this package is included in the library.

You must ensure timely (e.g., prior to any use of interfaces in the SAL)
calling of these procedures if a static SAL is built, or if a shared SAL
is built
with the project-level attribute ``Library_Auto_Init`` set to
``"false"``.

For a Stand-Alone Library, only the :file:`ALI` files of the Interface Units
(those that are listed in attribute ``Library_Interface``) are copied to
the Library Directory. As a consequence, only the Interface Units may be
imported from Ada units outside of the library. If other units are imported,
the binding phase will fail.

You can also build an encapsulated library where not only
the code to elaborate and finalize the library is embedded but also
ensure that the library is linked only against static
libraries. That means that an encapsulated library only depends on system
libraries: all other code, including the GNAT runtime, is embedded. To
build an encapsulated library you must set attribute
``Library_Standalone`` to ``encapsulated``:

.. code-block:: gpr

       for Library_Dir use "lib_dir";
       for Library_Name use "dummy";
       for Library_Kind use "dynamic";
       for Library_Interface use ("int1", "int1.child");
       for Library_Standalone use "encapsulated";

The default value for this attribute is ``standard`` in which case
a stand-alone library is built.

You may specify the attribute ``Library_Src_Dir`` for a Stand-Alone
Library. ``Library_Src_Dir`` has a single string value. Its value must
be the path (absolute or relative to the project directory) of an
existing directory. This directory cannot be the object directory or
one of the source directories, but it can be the same as the library
directory. The sources of the Interface Units of the library that are
needed by an Ada client of the library are copied to the designated
directory, called the Interface Copy directory, when the library is
built.  These sources include the specs of the Interface Units, but
they may also include bodies and subunits when pragmas ``Inline`` or
``Inline_Always`` are used or when there is a generic unit in the
spec. Before the sources are copied to the Interface Copy directory,
the building process makes an attempt to delete all files in the
Interface Copy directory.

Building stand-alone libraries by hand is somewhat tedious, but for those
occasions when it is necessary here are the steps that you need to perform:

* Compile all library sources.

* Invoke the binder with the switch :switch:`-n` (No Ada main program),
  with all the :file:`ALI` files of the interfaces, and
  with the switch :switch:`-L` to give specific names to the ``init``
  and ``final`` procedures.  For example:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatbind -n int1.ali int2.ali -Lsal1

* Compile the binder generated file:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gcc -c b~int2.adb

* Link the dynamic library with all the necessary object files,
  passing to the linker the names of the ``init`` (and possibly
  ``final``) procedures for automatic initialization (and finalization).
  You should place the built library in a different directory than
  the object files.

* Copy the ``ALI`` files of the interface to the library directory,
  add in this copy an indication that it is an interface to a SAL
  (i.e., add a word ``SL`` on the line in the :file:`ALI` file that starts
  with letter 'P') and make the modified copy of the :file:`ALI` file
  read-only.

Using SALs is not different from using other libraries
(see :ref:`Using_a_library`).

.. _Creating_a_Stand-alone_Library_to_be_used_in_a_non-Ada_context:

Creating a Stand-alone Library to be used in a non-Ada context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's easy for you to adapt the SAL build procedure discussed above for
use of a SAL in a non-Ada context.

The only extra step required is to ensure that library interface subprograms
are compatible with the main program, by means of ``pragma Export``
or ``pragma Convention``.

Here's an example of simple library interface for use with C main program:

.. code-block:: ada

       package My_Package is

          procedure Do_Something;
          pragma Export (C, Do_Something, "do_something");

          procedure Do_Something_Else;
          pragma Export (C, Do_Something_Else, "do_something_else");

       end My_Package;

On the C side, you must provide a 'foreign' view of the
library interface; remember that it should contain elaboration routines in
addition to interface subprograms.

The example below shows the content of :file:`mylib_interface.h` (note
that there is no rule for the naming of this file, any name can be used)

.. code-block:: c

       /* the library elaboration procedure */
       extern void mylibinit (void);

       /* the library finalization procedure */
       extern void mylibfinal (void);

       /* the interface exported by the library */
       extern void do_something (void);
       extern void do_something_else (void);

Libraries built as explained above can be used from any program, provided
the elaboration procedures (named ``mylibinit`` in the previous
example) are called before any library services are used. Any number of
libraries can be called from a single executable as long as the elaboration
procedure of each library is called.

Below is an example of a C program that uses the ``mylib`` library.

.. code-block:: c

       #include "mylib_interface.h"

       int
       main (void)
       {
          /* First, elaborate the library before using it */
          mylibinit ();

          /* Main program, using the library exported entities */
          do_something ();
          do_something_else ();

          /* Library finalization at the end of the program */
          mylibfinal ();
          return 0;
       }

Note that invoking any library finalization procedure generated by
``gnatbind`` shuts down the Ada run-time environment.
Consequently, the
finalization of all Ada libraries must be performed at the end of the program.
No call to these libraries or to the Ada run-time library should be made
after the finalization phase.

Information on limitations of binding Ada code in non-Ada contexts can be
found under :ref:`Binding_with_Non-Ada_Main_Programs`.

Note also that you must take special care with multi-tasking
applications. In that case, the initialization and finalization
routines are not protected against concurrent access. If you need such
requirement, you must ensure it at the application level
using a specific operating system services like a mutex or a
critical-section.

.. _Restrictions_in_Stand-alone_Libraries:

Restrictions in Stand-alone Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should use the pragmas listed below with caution inside libraries,
since they can create incompatibilities with other Ada libraries:

* pragma ``Locking_Policy``
* pragma ``Partition_Elaboration_Policy``
* pragma ``Queuing_Policy``
* pragma ``Task_Dispatching_Policy``
* pragma ``Unreserve_All_Interrupts``

When using a library that contains such pragmas, the user of the
library must ensure that all libraries use the same pragmas with the
same values. Otherwise, ``Program_Error`` will be raised during the
elaboration of the conflicting libraries. You should document the
usage of these pragmas and its consequences for the user.

Similarly, the traceback in the exception occurrence mechanism should be
enabled or disabled in a consistent manner across all libraries.
Otherwise, ``Program_Error`` will be raised during the elaboration of the
conflicting libraries.

If you use the ``Version`` or ``Body_Version``
attributes inside a library, you need to
perform a ``gnatbind`` step that specifies all :file:`ALI` files in all
libraries so that version identifiers can be properly computed.
In practice these attributes are rarely used, so this is unlikely
to be a consideration.

.. _Rebuilding_the_GNAT_Run-Time_Library:

Rebuilding the GNAT Run-Time Library
------------------------------------

.. index:: GNAT Run-Time Library, rebuilding
.. index:: Building the GNAT Run-Time Library
.. index:: Rebuilding the GNAT Run-Time Library
.. index:: Run-Time Library, rebuilding

You may need to recompile the GNAT library in various debugging or
experimentation contexts. The GNAT distribution provides a project
file called :file:`libada.gpr` to do that; it can be found in the
directory containing the GNAT library. The location of this directory
depends on the way the GNAT environment has been installed and can be
determined by means of the command:

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatls -v

The last entry in the source search path usually contains the
GNAT library (the :file:`adainclude` directory).

This project file contains its own documentation and, in particular, the
set of instructions needed to rebuild a new library and to use it.

Note that rebuilding the GNAT Run-Time is only recommended for temporary
experiments or debugging and is not supported for other purposes.

.. index:: ! Conditional compilation

.. _Conditional_Compilation:

Conditional Compilation
=======================

This section presents some guidelines for modeling conditional compilation in Ada and describes the
gnatprep preprocessor utility.

.. index:: ! Conditional compilation

.. _Modeling_Conditional_Compilation_in_Ada:

Modeling Conditional Compilation in Ada
---------------------------------------

You may want to arrange for a single source program
to serve multiple purposes, where it is compiled in different
ways to achieve these different goals. Some examples of the
need for this feature are

* Adapting a program to a different hardware environment
* Adapting a program to a different target architecture
* Turning debugging features on and off
* Arranging for a program to compile with different compilers

In C, or C++, the typical approach is to use the preprocessor
defined as part of the language. The Ada language does not
contain such a feature. This is not an oversight, but rather a very
deliberate design decision, based on the experience that overuse of
the preprocessing features in C and C++ can result in programs that
are extremely difficult to maintain. For example, if we have ten
switches that can be on or off, this means that there are a thousand
separate programs, any one of which might not even be syntactically
correct, and, even if syntactically correct,
might not work correctly. Testing all combinations can quickly become
impossible.

Nevertheless, the need to tailor programs certainly exists and in
this section we will discuss how this can
be achieved using Ada in general and GNAT in particular.

.. _Use_of_Boolean_Constants:

Use of Boolean Constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case where the difference is simply which code
sequence is executed, the cleanest solution is to use Boolean
constants to control which code is executed.

.. code-block:: ada

      FP_Initialize_Required : constant Boolean := True;
      ...
      if FP_Initialize_Required then
      ...
      end if;

Not only will the code inside the ``if`` statement not be executed if
the constant Boolean is ``False``, but it will also be completely
deleted from the program.
However, the code is only deleted after the ``if`` statement block
has been checked for syntactic and semantic correctness.
(In contrast, with preprocessors the code is deleted before the
compiler ever gets to see it, so it is not checked until the switch
is turned on.)

.. index:: Preprocessors (contrasted with conditional compilation)

Typically the Boolean constants will be in a separate package,
something like:

.. code-block:: ada

       package Config is
          FP_Initialize_Required : constant Boolean := True;
          Reset_Available        : constant Boolean := False;
          ...
       end Config;

You would write the ``Config`` package multiple forms for various targets,
with an appropriate script selecting the version of ``Config`` needed.
Then, any other unit requiring conditional compilation can do a |with|
of ``Config`` to make the constants visible.

.. _Debugging_-_A_Special_Case:

Debugging - A Special Case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A common use of conditional code is to execute statements (for example
dynamic checks, or output of intermediate results) under control of a
debug switch, so that the debugging behavior can be turned on and off.
You can do this by using a Boolean constant to control whether the debug code
is active:

.. code-block:: ada

       if Debugging then
          Put_Line ("got to the first stage!");
       end if;

or

.. code-block:: ada

       if Debugging and then Temperature > 999.0 then
          raise Temperature_Crazy;
       end if;

.. index:: pragma Assert

Since this is a common case, GNAT provides special features to deal
with this in a convenient manner. For the case of tests, Ada 2005 has
added a pragma ``Assert`` that you can use for such tests. This pragma
is modeled on the ``Assert`` pragma that has always been available in
GNAT, so you can use this feature with GNAT even if you are not using
Ada 2005 features.  The use of pragma ``Assert`` is described in the
:title:`GNAT_Reference_Manual`, but as an example, the last test could
be written:

.. code-block:: ada

       pragma Assert (Temperature <= 999.0, "Temperature Crazy");

or simply

.. code-block:: ada

       pragma Assert (Temperature <= 999.0);

In both cases, if assertions are active and the temperature is
excessive, the exception ``Assert_Failure`` is raised with the
exception message using the specified string in the first case or a
string indicating the location of the pragma in the second case.

.. index:: pragma Assertion_Policy

You can turn assertions on and off by using the ``Assertion_Policy``
pragma.

.. index:: -gnata switch

This is an Ada 2005 pragma that is implemented in all modes by
GNAT. Alternatively, you can use the :switch:`-gnata` switch
to enable assertions from the command line, which also applies to
all versions of Ada.

.. index:: pragma Debug

For the example above with the ``Put_Line``, the GNAT-specific pragma
``Debug`` can be used:

.. code-block:: ada

       pragma Debug (Put_Line ("got to the first stage!"));

If debug pragmas are enabled, the argument, which must be of the form
of a procedure call, is executed (in this case, ``Put_Line`` is
called).  You can specify only one call, but you can of course include
a special debugging procedure containing any code you like in the
program and call it in a pragma ``Debug`` argument as needed.

One advantage of pragma ``Debug`` over the ``if Debugging then``
construct is that pragma ``Debug`` can appear in declarative contexts,
such as at the very beginning of a procedure, before local declarations have
been elaborated.

.. index:: pragma Debug_Policy

You can enable debug pragmas using either the :switch:`-gnata` switch that also
controls assertions, or with a separate Debug_Policy pragma.

The latter pragma is new in the Ada 2005 versions of GNAT (but it can be used
in Ada 95 and Ada 83 programs as well) and is analogous to
pragma ``Assertion_Policy`` to control assertions.

``Assertion_Policy`` and ``Debug_Policy`` are configuration pragmas,
and thus can appear in :file:`gnat.adc` if you are not using a
project file or in the file designated to contain configuration pragmas
in a project file.
They then apply to all subsequent compilations. In practice the use of
the :switch:`-gnata` switch is often the most convenient method of controlling
the status of these pragmas.

Note that a pragma is not a statement, so in contexts where a statement
sequence is required, you can't just write a pragma on its own. You have
to add a ``null`` statement.

.. code-block:: ada

       if ... then
          ... -- some statements
       else
          pragma Assert (Num_Cases < 10);
          null;
       end if;

.. _Conditionalizing_Declarations:

Conditionalizing Declarations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases it may be necessary to conditionalize declarations to meet
different requirements. For example we might want a bit string whose length
is set to meet some hardware message requirement.

This may be possible using declare blocks controlled
by conditional constants:

.. code-block:: ada

       if Small_Machine then
          declare
             X : Bit_String (1 .. 10);
          begin
             ...
          end;
       else
          declare
             X : Large_Bit_String (1 .. 1000);
          begin
             ...
          end;
       end if;

Note that in this approach, both declarations are analyzed by the
compiler so this can only be used where both declarations are legal,
even though one of them will not be used.

Another approach is to define integer constants, e.g., ``Bits_Per_Word``,
or Boolean constants, e.g., ``Little_Endian``, and then write declarations
that are parameterized by these constants. For example

.. code-block:: ada

       for Rec use
         Field1 at 0 range Boolean'Pos (Little_Endian) * 10 .. Bits_Per_Word;
       end record;

If ``Bits_Per_Word`` is set to 32, this generates either

.. code-block:: ada

       for Rec use
         Field1 at 0 range 0 .. 32;
       end record;

for the big endian case, or

.. code-block:: ada

       for Rec use record
           Field1 at 0 range 10 .. 32;
       end record;

for the little endian case. Since a powerful subset of Ada expression
notation is usable for creating static constants, clever use of this
feature can often solve quite difficult problems in conditionalizing
compilation (note incidentally that in Ada 95, the little endian
constant was introduced as ``System.Default_Bit_Order``, so you don't
need to define this one yourself).

.. _Use_of_Alternative_Implementations:

Use of Alternative Implementations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, none of the approaches described above are adequate. This
can occur, for example, if the set of declarations required is radically
different for two different configurations.

In this situation, the official Ada way of dealing with conditionalizing
such code is to write separate units for the different cases. As long as
this doesn't result in excessive duplication of code, you can do this
without creating maintenance problems. The approach is to share common
code as far as possible and then isolate the code and declarations
that are different. Subunits are often a convenient method for breaking
out a piece of a unit that you need to be conditionalized, with separate files
for different versions of the subunit for different targets, where the
build script selects the right one to give to the compiler.

.. index:: Subunits (and conditional compilation)

As an example, consider a situation where a new feature in Ada 2005
allows something to be done in a really nice way. But your code must be able
to compile with an Ada 95 compiler. Conceptually you want to say:

.. code-block:: ada

       if Ada_2005 then
          ... neat Ada 2005 code
       else
          ... not quite as neat Ada 95 code
       end if;

where ``Ada_2005`` is a Boolean constant.

But this won't work when ``Ada_2005`` is set to ``False``,
since the ``then`` clause will be illegal for an Ada 95 compiler.
(Recall that although such unreachable code would eventually be deleted
by the compiler, it still needs to be legal.  If it uses features
introduced in Ada 2005, it's still illegal in Ada 95.)

So instead, we write

.. code-block:: ada

       procedure Insert is separate;

Then we have two files for the subunit ``Insert``, with the two sets of
code.
If the package containing this is called ``File_Queries``, then we might
have two files

* :file:`file_queries-insert-2005.adb`
* :file:`file_queries-insert-95.adb`

and the build script renames the appropriate file to :file:`file_queries-insert.adb` and then carries out the compilation.

This can also be done with project files' naming schemes. For example:

.. code-block:: gpr

       for body ("File_Queries.Insert") use "file_queries-insert-2005.ada";

Note also that with project files, you should use a different extension
than :file:`ads` / :file:`adb` for alternative versions. Otherwise, a naming
conflict may arise through another commonly used feature: declaring as part
of the project a set of directories containing all the sources obeying the
default naming scheme.

The use of alternative units is certainly feasible in all situations,
and for example the Ada part of the GNAT run-time is conditionalized
based on the target architecture using this approach. As a specific example,
consider the implementation of the AST feature in VMS. There is one
spec: :file:`s-asthan.ads` which is the same for all architectures, and three
bodies:

* :file:`s-asthan.adb`
    used for all non-VMS operating systems

* :file:`s-asthan-vms-alpha.adb`
    used for VMS on the Alpha

* :file:`s-asthan-vms-ia64.adb`
    used for VMS on the ia64

The dummy version :file:`s-asthan.adb` simply raises exceptions noting that
this operating system feature is not available and the two remaining
versions interface with the corresponding versions of VMS to provide
VMS-compatible AST handling. The GNAT build script knows the architecture
and operating system, and automatically selects the right version,
renaming it if necessary to :file:`s-asthan.adb` before the run-time build.

Another style for arranging alternative implementations is through
Ada's access-to-subprogram facility.  In case some functionality is to
be conditionally included, you can declare an access-to-procedure
variable ``Ref`` that is initialized to designate a 'do nothing'
procedure, and then invoke ``Ref.all`` when appropriate.  Then, in,
some library package, set ``Ref`` to ``Proc'Access`` for some
procedure ``Proc`` that performs the relevant processing.  The
initialization only occurs if the library package is included in the
program.  The same idea can also be implemented using tagged types and
dispatching calls.

.. _Preprocessing:

Preprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: Preprocessing

Although it is quite possible to conditionalize code without the use of
C-style preprocessing, as described in the cases above, it is
nevertheless convenient in some cases to use the C approach. Moreover,
older Ada compilers have often provided some preprocessing capability,
so legacy code may depend on this approach, even though it is not
standard.

To accommodate such use, GNAT provides a preprocessor (modeled to a large
extent on the various preprocessors that have been used
with legacy code on other compilers, to enable easier transition).

.. index:: gnatprep

You can use the preprocessor used in two different modes. You can use it
separately from the compiler to generate a separate output source file,
which you then feed to the compiler as a separate step. This is the
``gnatprep`` utility, whose use is fully described in
:ref:`Preprocessing_with_gnatprep`.

The preprocessing language allows such constructs as

.. code-block:: c

       #if DEBUG or else (PRIORITY > 4) then
          sequence of declarations
       #else
          completely different sequence of declarations
       #end if;

The values of the symbols ``DEBUG`` and ``PRIORITY`` can be
defined either on the command line or in a separate file.

The other way of running the preprocessor is even closer to the C style and
often more convenient. In this approach, the preprocessing is integrated into
the compilation process. You pass the compiler the preprocessor input, which
includes ``#if`` lines etc, and the compiler carries out the
preprocessing internally and compiles the resulting output.
For more details on this approach, see :ref:`Integrated_Preprocessing`.

.. _Preprocessing_with_gnatprep:

Preprocessing with ``gnatprep``
-------------------------------

.. index:: ! gnatprep
.. index:: Preprocessing (gnatprep)

This section discusses how to you can use GNAT's ``gnatprep`` utility
for simple preprocessing.  Although designed for use with GNAT,
``gnatprep`` does not depend on any special GNAT features.  For
further discussion of conditional compilation in general, see
:ref:`Conditional_Compilation`.

.. _Preprocessing_Symbols:

Preprocessing Symbols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preprocessing symbols are defined in *definition files* and referenced in the
sources to be preprocessed. A preprocessing symbol is an identifier, following
normal Ada (case-insensitive) rules for its syntax, with the restriction that
all characters need to be in the ASCII set (no accented letters).

.. _Using_gnatprep:

Using ``gnatprep``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To call ``gnatprep`` use:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ gnatprep [ switches ] infile outfile [ deffile ]

where

* *switches*
    is an optional sequence of switches as described in the next section.

* *infile*
    is the full name of the input file, which is an Ada source
    file containing preprocessor directives.

* *outfile*
    is the full name of the output file, which is an Ada source
    in standard Ada form. When used with GNAT, this file name will
    normally have an ``ads`` or ``adb`` suffix.

* ``deffile``
    is the full name of a text file containing definitions of
    preprocessing symbols to be referenced by the preprocessor. You
    can omit this argument and instead use the :switch:`-D` switch.


.. _Switches_for_gnatprep:

Switches for ``gnatprep``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: --version (gnatprep)

:switch:`--version`
  Display copyright and version, then exit, disregarding all other options.

.. index:: --help (gnatprep)

:switch:`--help`
  If :switch:`--version` was not used, display usage and then exit, disregarding
  all other options.

.. index:: -b (gnatprep)

:switch:`-b`
  Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted by
  preprocessing to be replaced by blank lines in the output source file,
  preserving line numbers in the output file.

.. index:: -c (gnatprep)

:switch:`-c`
  Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted
  by preprocessing to be retained in the output source as comments marked
  with the special string ``"--! "``. This option also results in line numbers
  being preserved in the output file.

.. index:: -C (gnatprep)

:switch:`-C`
  Causes comments to be scanned. Normally comments are ignored by
  ``gnatprep``.  If you specify this option, ``gnatprep`` scans
  comments and any $symbol substitutions performed as in program
  text. You will find this particularly useful when structured
  comments are used (e.g., for programs written in a pre-2014 version
  of the SPARK Ada subset). This switch is not available
  when doing integrated preprocessing (it would be useless in this
  context since comments are always ignored by the compiler).

.. index:: -D (gnatprep)

:switch:`-D{symbol}[={value}]`
  Defines a new preprocessing symbol with the specified value. If you
  don't specify a value, the symbol is defined to be ``True``. You can
  use this switch instead of providing a definition file.

.. index:: -r (gnatprep)

:switch:`-r`
  Causes ``gnatprep`` to generate a ``Source_Reference`` pragma that
  references the original input file, so that error messages will use
  the file name of this original file. The use of this switch implies
  that preprocessor lines are not to be removed from the file, so
  the :switch:`-b` and :switch:`-c` are always enabled.

  If the file to be preprocessed contains multiple units, you
  must call ``gnatchop`` on the the output file from
  ``gnatprep``. If a ``Source_Reference`` pragma is present
  in the preprocessed file, it will be respected by
  ``gnatchop -r``
  so that the final chopped files will correctly refer to the original
  input source file passed to ``gnatprep``.

.. index:: -s (gnatprep)

:switch:`-s`
  Causes a sorted list of symbol names and values to be
  listed on the standard output file.

.. index:: -T (gnatprep)

:switch:`-T`
  Use LF as line terminators when writing files. By default the line terminator
  of the host (LF under unix, CR/LF under Windows) is used.

.. index:: -u (gnatprep)

:switch:`-u`
  Causes undefined symbols to be treated as having the value ``False``
  in the context of a preprocessor test. If you don't specify this
  switch, ``gnatprep`` will treat an undefined symbol in a ``#if`` or
  ``#elsif`` test as an error.

.. index:: -v (gnatprep)

:switch:`-v`
  Verbose mode: generates more output about what is done.

Note: if you don't specify either :switch:`-b` or :switch:`-c`,
then preprocessor lines and
deleted lines are completely removed from the output, unless you specify
:switch:`-r`, in which case ``gnatprep`` enables the :switch:`-b` switch.


.. _Form_of_Definitions_File:

Form of Definitions File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The definitions file contains lines of the form::

      symbol := value

where ``symbol`` is a preprocessing symbol, and ``value`` is one of the following:

*  Empty, corresponding to a null substitution,
*  A string literal using normal Ada syntax, or
*  Any sequence of characters from the set {letters, digits, period, underline}.

You may also place comment lines in the definitions file, starting with
the usual ``--``
and comments may be added to the end of each definition line.


.. _Form_of_Input_Text_for_gnatprep:

Form of Input Text for ``gnatprep``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input text contains preprocessor conditional inclusion lines
as well as general symbol substitution sequences.

Preprocessor conditional inclusion commands have the form:

.. code-block:: c

       #if <expression> [then]
          lines
       #elsif <expression> [then]
          lines
       #elsif <expression> [then]
          lines
       ...
       #else
          lines
       #end if;

In this example, <expression> is defined by the following grammar::

       <expression> ::=  <symbol>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> = "<value>"
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> = <symbol>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> = <integer>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> > <integer>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> >= <integer>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> < <integer>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> <= <integer>
       <expression> ::=  <symbol> 'Defined
       <expression> ::=  not <expression>
       <expression> ::=  <expression> and <expression>
       <expression> ::=  <expression> or <expression>
       <expression> ::=  <expression> and then <expression>
       <expression> ::=  <expression> or else <expression>
       <expression> ::=  ( <expression> )

For the first test, (<expression> ::= <symbol>), the symbol must have
either the value true or false. The right-hand of the
symbol definition must be one of the (case-insensitive) literals
``True`` or ``False``. If the value is true, the
corresponding lines are included and if the value is false, they are
excluded.

When comparing a symbol to an integer, the integer is any non negative
literal integer as defined in the Ada Reference Manual, such as 3, 16#FF# or
2#11#. The symbol value must also be a non negative integer. Integer values
in the range 0 .. 2**31-1 are supported.

The test (<expression> ::= <symbol>'Defined) is true only if
the symbol has been defined in the definition file or by a :switch:`-D`
switch on the command line. Otherwise, the test is false.

The equality tests are case insensitive, as are all the preprocessor lines.

If the symbol referenced is not defined in the symbol definitions
file, the result depends on whether or not you have specified the
:switch:`-u` switch. If you have, the symbol is treated as if it had
the value false and the test fails. If not,
it's an error to reference an undefined symbol. It's also an
error to reference a symbol that you have defined with a value other than
``True`` or ``False``.

The use of the ``not`` operator inverts the sense of this logical
test.  You can't combine the ``not`` operator with the ``or`` or
``and`` operators without parentheses. For example, you can't write
"if not X or Y then" allowed, but can write either "if (not X) or Y
then" or "if not (X or Y) then".

The ``then`` keyword is optional, as shown.

You must place the ``#`` in the first non-blank character on a line,
i.e., it must be preceded only by spaces or horizontal tabs, but
otherwise the format is free form. You may place spaces or tabs
between the ``#`` and the keyword. The keywords and the symbols are
case insensitive, as in normal Ada code. You can write comments on a
preprocessor line, but other than that, you can't place any other
tokens on a preprocessor line. You can have any number of ``elsif``
clauses, including none at all. The ``else`` is optional, as in Ada.

You obtain symbol substitution outside of preprocessor lines by using
the sequence::

      $symbol

anywhere within a source line, except in a comment or within a
string literal. The identifier
following the ``$`` must match one of the symbols defined in the symbol
definition file and the resulting output substitutes the value of the
symbol in place of ``$symbol`` in the output file.

Note that although you can't substitute strings within a string
literal, you can have a symbol whose defined value is a string
literal. So instead of setting XYZ to ``hello`` and writing:

.. code-block:: ada

     Header : String := "$XYZ";

you should set XYZ to ``"hello"`` and write:

.. code-block:: ada

     Header : String := $XYZ;

and then the substitution will occur as desired.


.. _Integrated_Preprocessing:

Integrated Preprocessing
------------------------

As noted above, a file to be preprocessed consists of Ada source code
in which preprocessing lines have been inserted. However, instead of
using ``gnatprep`` to explicitly preprocess a file as a separate step
before compilation, you can carry out the preprocessing implicitly as
part of compilation. Such *integrated preprocessing*, which is the
common style with C, is performed when you pass either or both of the
following switches to the compiler:

   *   :switch:`-gnatep`, which specifies the *preprocessor data file*.
       This file dictates how the source files will be preprocessed (e.g., which
       symbol definition files apply to which sources).

   *   :switch:`-gnateD`, which defines values for preprocessing symbols.

Integrated preprocessing applies only to Ada source files; it's
not available for configuration pragma files.

With integrated preprocessing, GNAT doesn't write the output from the
preprocessor, by default, to any external file. Instead it's passed
internally to the compiler. To preserve the result of preprocessing in
a file, either run ``gnatprep`` in standalone mode or supply the
:switch:`-gnateG` switch to the compiler.

When using project files:

   * you should use the builder switch :switch:`-x`  if any Ada source is
     compiled with :switch:`gnatep=` so that the compiler finds the
     *preprocessor data file*.

   * you should place the preprocessing data file and the symbol
     definition files in the source directories of the project.

Note that the ``gnatmake`` switch :switch:`-m` will almost
always trigger recompilation for sources that are preprocessed,
because ``gnatmake`` cannot compute the checksum of the source after
preprocessing.

The actual preprocessing function is described in detail in
:ref:`Preprocessing_with_gnatprep`. This section explains the switches
that relate to integrated preprocessing.

.. index:: -gnatep (gcc)

:switch:`-gnatep={preprocessor_data_file}`
  This switch specifies the file name (without directory
  information) of the preprocessor data file. Either place this file
  in one of the source directories, or, when using project
  files, reference the project file's directory via the
  ``project_name'Project_Dir`` project attribute; e.g:

     .. code-block:: gpr

         project Prj is
            package Compiler is
               for Switches ("Ada") use
                 ("-gnatep=" & Prj'Project_Dir & "prep.def");
            end Compiler;
         end Prj;

  A preprocessor data file is a text file that contains *preprocessor
  control lines*.  A preprocessor control line directs the preprocessing of
  either a particular source file, or, analogous to ``others`` in Ada,
  all sources not specified elsewhere in  the preprocessor data file.
  A preprocessor control line
  can optionally identify a *definition file* that assigns values to
  preprocessor symbols, as well as a list of switches that relate to
  preprocessing.
  You can also include empty lines and comments (using Ada syntax), with no
  semantic effect.

  Here's an example of a preprocessor data file:

    .. code-block:: ada

        "toto.adb"  "prep.def" -u
        --  Preprocess toto.adb, using definition file prep.def
        --  Undefined symbols are treated as False

        * -c -DVERSION=V101
        --  Preprocess all other sources without using a definition file
        --  Suppressed lined are commented
        --  Symbol VERSION has the value V101

        "tata.adb" "prep2.def" -s
        --  Preprocess tata.adb, using definition file prep2.def
        --  List all symbols with their values

  A preprocessor control line has the following syntax:

    ::

        <preprocessor_control_line> ::=
           <preprocessor_input> [ <definition_file_name> ] { <switch> }

        <preprocessor_input> ::= <source_file_name> | '*'

        <definition_file_name> ::= <string_literal>

        <source_file_name> := <string_literal>

        <switch> := (See below for list)

  Thus, you start each preprocessor control line either a literal
  string or the character '*':

  *  A literal string is the file name (without directory information) of the source
     file that will be input to the preprocessor.

  *  The character '*' is a wild-card indicator; the additional parameters on the line
     indicate the preprocessing for all the sources
     that are not specified explicitly on other lines (the order of the lines is not
     significant).

  You cannot have two lines with the same file name or two
  lines starting with the '*' character.

  After the file name or '*', you can place an optional literal string
  to specify the name of the definition file to be used for
  preprocessing (:ref:`Form_of_Definitions_File`). The definition
  files are found by the compiler in one of the source directories. In
  some cases, when compiling a source in a directory other than the
  current directory, if the definition file is in the current
  directory, you may need to add the current directory as a
  source directory through the :switch:`-I` switch; otherwise the
  compiler would not find the definition file.

  Finally, switches similar to those of ``gnatprep`` may optionally appear:

  :switch:`-b`
    Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted by
    preprocessing to be replaced by blank lines, preserving the line number.
    This switch is always implied; however, if specified after :switch:`-c`
    it cancels the effect of :switch:`-c`.

  :switch:`-c`
    Causes both preprocessor lines and the lines deleted
    by preprocessing to be retained as comments marked
    with the special string '`--!`'.


  :switch:`-D{symbol}={new_value}`
    Define or redefine ``symbol`` to have ``new_value`` as its value.
    You can write ``symbol`` as either an Ada identifier or any Ada
    reserved word aside from ``if``, ``else``, ``elsif``, ``end``,
    ``and``, ``or`` and ``then``.  You can write ``new_value`` as a
    literal string, an Ada identifier or any Ada reserved word. A
    symbol declared with this switch replaces a symbol with the same
    name defined in a definition file.


  :switch:`-s`
    Causes a sorted list of symbol names and values to be
    listed on the standard output file.


  :switch:`-u`
    Causes undefined symbols to be treated as having the value
    ``FALSE`` in the context of a preprocessor test. If you don't
    specify this switch, an undefined symbol in a ``#if`` or
    ``#elsif`` test is treated as an error.


.. index:: -gnateD (gcc)

:switch:`-gnateD{symbol}[={new_value}]`
  Define or redefine ``symbol`` to have ``new_value`` as its value. If
  you don't specify a value, the value of ``symbol`` is ``True``.  You
  write ``symbol`` as an identifier, following normal Ada
  (case-insensitive) rules for its syntax, and ``new_value`` as either
  an arbitrary string between double quotes or any sequence (including
  an empty sequence) of characters from the set (letters, digits,
  period, underline).  Ada reserved words may be used as symbols, with
  the exceptions of ``if``, ``else``, ``elsif``, ``end``, ``and``,
  ``or`` and ``then``.

  Examples:

    ::

        -gnateDToto=Tata
        -gnateDFoo
        -gnateDFoo=\"Foo-Bar\"

  A symbol declared with this switch on the command line replaces a
  symbol with the same name either in a definition file or specified with a
  switch :switch:`-D` in the preprocessor data file.

  This switch is similar to switch :switch:`-D` of ``gnatprep``.


:switch:`-gnateG`
  When integrated preprocessing is performed on source file :file:`filename.extension`,
  create or overwrite :file:`filename.extension.prep` to contain
  the result of the preprocessing.
  For example if the source file is :file:`foo.adb` then
  the output file is :file:`foo.adb.prep`.


.. _Mixed_Language_Programming:

Mixed Language Programming
==========================

.. index:: Mixed Language Programming

This section describes how to develop a mixed-language program,
with a focus on combining Ada with C or C++.

.. _Interfacing_to_C:

Interfacing to C
----------------

Interfacing Ada with a foreign language such as C involves using
compiler directives to import and/or export entity definitions in each
language -- using ``extern`` statements in C, for example, and the
``Import``, ``Export``, and ``Convention`` pragmas in Ada.
A full treatment of these topics is provided in Appendix B, section 1
of the Ada Reference Manual.

There are two ways to build a program using GNAT that contains some Ada
sources and some foreign language sources, depending on whether or not
the main subprogram is written in Ada.  Here's an example with
the main subprogram in Ada:

.. code-block:: c

    /* file1.c */
    #include <stdio.h>

    void print_num (int num)
    {
      printf ("num is %d.\\n", num);
      return;
    }

.. code-block:: c

    /* file2.c */

    /* num_from_Ada is declared in my_main.adb */
    extern int num_from_Ada;

    int get_num (void)
    {
      return num_from_Ada;
    }

.. code-block:: ada

    --  my_main.adb
    procedure My_Main is

       --  Declare then export an Integer entity called num_from_Ada
       My_Num : Integer := 10;
       pragma Export (C, My_Num, "num_from_Ada");

       --  Declare an Ada function spec for Get_Num, then use
       --  C function get_num for the implementation.
       function Get_Num return Integer;
       pragma Import (C, Get_Num, "get_num");

       --  Declare an Ada procedure spec for Print_Num, then use
       --  C function print_num for the implementation.
       procedure Print_Num (Num : Integer);
       pragma Import (C, Print_Num, "print_num");

    begin
       Print_Num (Get_Num);
    end My_Main;

To build this example:

* First compile the foreign language files to
  generate object files:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gcc -c file1.c
      $ gcc -c file2.c

* Then compile the Ada units to produce a set of object files and ALI
  files:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatmake -c my_main.adb

* Run the Ada binder on the Ada main program:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatbind my_main.ali

* Link the Ada main program, the Ada objects, and the other language
  objects:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatlink my_main.ali file1.o file2.o

You can merge the last three steps into a single command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ gnatmake my_main.adb -largs file1.o file2.o


.. index:: Binder output file

If the main program is in a language other than Ada, you may have more
than one entry point into the Ada subsystem. You must use a special
binder option to generate callable routines that initialize and
finalize the Ada units (:ref:`Binding_with_Non-Ada_Main_Programs`).
You must insert calls to the initialization and finalization routines
in the main program or some other appropriate point in the code. You
must place the call to initialize the Ada units so that it occurs
before the first Ada subprogram is called and must place the call to
finalize the Ada units so it occurs after the last Ada subprogram
returns. The binder places the initialization and finalization
subprograms into the :file:`b~xxx.adb` file, where they can be
accessed by your C sources.  To illustrate, we have the following
example:

.. code-block:: c

     /* main.c */
     extern void adainit (void);
     extern void adafinal (void);
     extern int add (int, int);
     extern int sub (int, int);

     int main (int argc, char *argv[])
     {
        int a = 21, b = 7;

        adainit();

        /* Should print "21 + 7 = 28" */
        printf ("%d + %d = %d\\n", a, b, add (a, b));

        /* Should print "21 - 7 = 14" */
        printf ("%d - %d = %d\\n", a, b, sub (a, b));

        adafinal();
     }

.. code-block:: ada

     --  unit1.ads
     package Unit1 is
        function Add (A, B : Integer) return Integer;
        pragma Export (C, Add, "add");
     end Unit1;

.. code-block:: ada

     --  unit1.adb
     package body Unit1 is
        function Add (A, B : Integer) return Integer is
        begin
           return A + B;
        end Add;
     end Unit1;

.. code-block:: ada

     --  unit2.ads
     package Unit2 is
        function Sub (A, B : Integer) return Integer;
        pragma Export (C, Sub, "sub");
     end Unit2;

.. code-block:: ada

     --  unit2.adb
     package body Unit2 is
        function Sub (A, B : Integer) return Integer is
        begin
           return A - B;
        end Sub;
     end Unit2;

The build procedure for this application is similar to the last
example's:

* First, compile the foreign language files to generate object files:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gcc -c main.c


* Next, compile the Ada units to produce a set of object files and ALI
  files:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatmake -c unit1.adb
      $ gnatmake -c unit2.adb

* Run the Ada binder on every generated ALI file.  Make sure to use the
  :switch:`-n` option to specify a foreign main program:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatbind -n unit1.ali unit2.ali

* Link the Ada main program, the Ada objects and the foreign language
  objects. You need only list the last ALI file here:

  .. code-block:: sh

      $ gnatlink unit2.ali main.o -o exec_file

  This procedure yields a binary executable called :file:`exec_file`.

Depending on the circumstances (for example when your non-Ada main object
does not provide symbol ``main``), you may also need to instruct the
GNAT linker not to include the standard startup objects by passing the
:switch:`-nostartfiles` switch to ``gnatlink``.

.. _Calling_Conventions:

Calling Conventions
-------------------

.. index:: Foreign Languages

.. index:: Calling Conventions

GNAT follows standard calling sequence conventions and will interface
to any other language that also follows these conventions. The following
Convention identifiers are recognized by GNAT:


.. index:: Interfacing to Ada

.. index:: Other Ada compilers

.. index:: Convention Ada

``Ada``
  This indicates that the standard Ada calling sequence is
  used and all Ada data items may be passed without any limitations in the
  case where GNAT is used to generate both the caller and callee. You can also
  mix GNAT generated code and code generated by another Ada
  compiler. In this case, you should restrict the data types to simple
  cases, including primitive types. Whether complex data types can be passed
  depends on the situation. It is probably safe to pass simple arrays, such
  as arrays of integers or floats. Records may or may not work, depending
  on whether both compilers lay them out identically. Complex structures
  involving variant records, access parameters, tasks, or protected types,
  are unlikely to be able to be passed.

  If output from two different compilers is mixed, you are responsible
  for dealing with elaboration issues. Probably the safest approach is
  to write the main program in the version of Ada other than GNAT, so
  it takes care of its own elaboration requirements, and
  call the GNAT-generated adainit procedure to ensure elaboration of
  the GNAT components. Consult the documentation of the other Ada
  compiler for further details on elaboration.

.. index:: Interfacing to Assembly

.. index:: Convention Assembler


``Assembler``
  Specifies assembler as the convention. In practice this has the
  same effect as convention Ada (but is not equivalent in the sense of being
  considered the same convention).

.. index:: Convention Asm

.. index:: Asm

``Asm``
  Equivalent to Assembler.

  .. index:: Interfacing to COBOL

  .. index:: Convention COBOL

.. index:: COBOL

``COBOL``
  Data is passed according to the conventions described
  in section B.4 of the Ada Reference Manual.

.. index:: C
.. index:: Interfacing to C

.. index:: Convention C


``C``
  Data is passed according to the conventions described
  in section B.3 of the Ada Reference Manual.

  A note on interfacing to a C 'varargs' function:

    .. index:: C varargs function
    .. index:: Interfacing to C varargs function
    .. index:: varargs function interfaces

    In C, ``varargs`` allows a function to take a variable number of
    arguments. There is no direct equivalent in this to Ada. One
    approach that you can use is to create a C wrapper for each
    different profile and then interface to this C wrapper. For
    example, to print an ``int`` value using ``printf``,
    create a C function ``printfi`` that takes two arguments, a
    pointer to a string and an int, and calls ``printf``.
    Then in the Ada program, use pragma ``Import`` to
    interface to ``printfi``.

    It may work on some platforms to directly interface to
    a ``varargs`` function by providing a specific Ada profile
    for a particular call. However, this does not work on
    all platforms since there is no guarantee that the
    calling sequence for a two-argument normal C function
    is the same as for calling a ``varargs`` C function with
    the same two arguments.

.. index:: Convention Default

.. index:: Default

``Default``
  Equivalent to C.

.. index:: Convention External

.. index:: External

``External``
  Equivalent to C.

.. index:: C++
.. index:: Interfacing to C++

.. index:: Convention C++


``C_Plus_Plus`` (or ``CPP``)
  This stands for C++. For most purposes, this is identical to C.
  See the separate description of the specialized GNAT pragmas relating to
  C++ interfacing for further details.

.. index:: Fortran
.. index:: Interfacing to Fortran
.. index:: Convention Fortran


``Fortran``
  Data is passed according to the conventions described
  in section B.5 of the Ada Reference Manual.


``Intrinsic``
  This applies to an intrinsic operation, as defined in the Ada
  Reference Manual. If a pragma Import (Intrinsic) applies to a subprogram,
  it means the body of the subprogram is provided by the compiler itself,
  usually by means of an efficient code sequence, and that you don't
  supply an explicit body for it. In an application program, the pragma may
  be applied to the following sets of names:


  * ``Rotate_Left``, ``Rotate_Right``, ``Shift_Left``, ``Shift_Right``, ``Shift_Right_Arithmetic``.
    The corresponding subprogram declaration must have
    two formal parameters. The
    first must be a signed integer type or a modular type with a binary
    modulus and the second parameter must be of type Natural.
    The return type must be the same as the type of the first argument. The size
    of this type can only be 8, 16, 32, or 64.


  * Binary arithmetic operators: '+', '-', '*', '/'.
    The corresponding operator declaration must have parameters and result type
    that have the same root numeric type (for example, all three are long_float
    types). This simplifies the definition of operations that use type checking
    to perform dimensional checks:


    .. code-block:: ada

        type Distance is new Long_Float;
        type Time     is new Long_Float;
        type Velocity is new Long_Float;
        function "/" (D : Distance; T : Time)
          return Velocity;
        pragma Import (Intrinsic, "/");

    You often program this common idiom with a generic definition and an
    explicit body. The pragma makes it simpler to introduce such declarations.
    It incurs no overhead in compilation time or code size because it is
    implemented as a single machine instruction.


  * General subprogram entities. This is used  to bind an Ada subprogram
    declaration to
    a compiler builtin by name with back ends where such interfaces are
    available. A typical example is the set of ``__builtin`` functions
    exposed by the ``gcc`` back end, as in the following example:


    .. code-block:: ada

         function builtin_sqrt (F : Float) return Float;
         pragma Import (Intrinsic, builtin_sqrt, "__builtin_sqrtf");

    Most of the ``gcc`` builtins are accessible this way, and as for other
    import conventions (e.g. C), it is the user's responsibility to ensure
    that the Ada subprogram profile matches the underlying builtin
    expectations.

.. index:: Stdcall
.. index:: Convention Stdcall

``Stdcall``
  This is relevant only to Windows implementations of GNAT
  and specifies that the ``Stdcall`` calling sequence is used,
  as defined by the NT API. To simplify building
  cross-platform bindings, this convention is handled as a ``C`` calling
  convention on non-Windows platforms.

.. index:: DLL
.. index:: Convention DLL


``DLL``
  This is equivalent to ``Stdcall``.

.. index:: Win32
.. index:: Convention Win32


``Win32``
  This is equivalent to ``Stdcall``.

.. index:: Stubbed
.. index:: Convention Stubbed


``Stubbed``
  This is a special convention that indicates that the compiler
  should provide a stub body that raises ``Program_Error``.

GNAT additionally provides a useful pragma ``Convention_Identifier``
that you can use to parameterize conventions and allow additional synonyms.
For example, if you have legacy code in which the convention
identifier Fortran77 was used for Fortran, you can use the configuration
pragma:

.. code-block:: ada

     pragma Convention_Identifier (Fortran77, Fortran);

And from now on, you can use  the identifier ``Fortran77`` as a convention
identifier (for example in an ``Import`` pragma) with the same
meaning as ``Fortran``.


.. _Building_Mixed_Ada_and_C++_Programs:

Building Mixed Ada and C++ Programs
-----------------------------------

If you are inexperienced with mixed-language development, you may find that
building an application containing both Ada and C++ code can be a
challenge.  This section gives a few hints that should make this task easier.

.. _Interfacing_to_C++:

Interfacing to C++
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GNAT supports interfacing with the G++ compiler (or any C++ compiler
generating code that is compatible with the G++ Application Binary
Interface ---see http://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html).

You can do interfacing at three levels: simple data, subprograms, and
classes. In the first two cases, GNAT offers a specific ``Convention C_Plus_Plus``
(or ``CPP``) that behaves exactly like ``Convention C``.
Usually, C++ mangles the names of subprograms. To generate proper mangled
names automatically, see :ref:`Generating_Ada_Bindings_for_C_and_C++_headers`).
You can also address this problem addressed manually in two ways:

* by modifying the C++ code in order to force a C convention using
  the ``extern "C"`` syntax.

* by figuring out the mangled name (using e.g. ``nm`` or by looking at the
  assembly code generated by the C++ compiler) and using it as the
  ``Link_Name`` argument of the pragma ``Import``.

You can achieve interfacing at the class level by using the GNAT specific
pragmas such as ``CPP_Constructor``.  See the :title:`GNAT_Reference_Manual` for additional information.

.. _Linking_a_Mixed_C++_and_Ada_Program:

Linking a Mixed C++ & Ada Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Usually the linker, of the C++ development system must be used to link
mixed applications because most C++ systems resolve elaboration
issues (such as calling constructors on global class instances)
transparently during the link phase. GNAT has been adapted to ease the
use of a foreign linker for the last phase. We consider three cases:


* Using GNAT and G++ (GNU C++ compiler) from the same GCC installation:
  You can call the C++ linker by using the C++ specific driver
  called ``g++``.

  If the C++ code uses inline functions that you plan to call from
  Ada, you need to compile your C++ code with the
  :switch:`-fkeep-inline-functions` so ``g++`` doesn't delete these
  functions.

  .. code-block:: sh

    $ g++ -c -fkeep-inline-functions file1.C
    $ g++ -c -fkeep-inline-functions file2.C
    $ gnatmake ada_unit -largs file1.o file2.o --LINK=g++


* Using GNAT and G++ from two different GCC installations: If both
  compilers are on the :envvar:`PATH`, you may use the previous
  method.  However, environment variables such as
  :envvar:`C_INCLUDE_PATH`, :envvar:`GCC_EXEC_PREFIX`,
  :envvar:`BINUTILS_ROOT`, and :envvar:`GCC_ROOT` affect both
  compilers at the same time and may make one of the two compilers
  operate improperly if set during invocation of the wrong compiler.
  It is also very important that the linker uses the proper
  :file:`libgcc.a` ``gcc`` library -- that is, the one from the C++
  compiler installation. You can replace the implicit link command as
  suggested in the ``gnatmake`` command from the former example with
  an explicit link command with the full-verbosity option
  in order to verify which library is used:

  .. code-block:: sh

    $ gnatbind ada_unit
    $ gnatlink -v -v ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=c++

  If there's a problem due to interfering environment variables, you can
  work around it by using an intermediate script. The following example
  shows the proper script to use when GNAT has not been installed at its
  default location and ``g++`` has been installed at its default location:

  .. code-block:: sh

    $ cat ./my_script
    #!/bin/sh
    unset BINUTILS_ROOT
    unset GCC_ROOT
    c++ $*
    $ gnatlink -v -v ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=./my_script


* Using a non-GNU C++ compiler: You can use the commands previously described
  used to insure that the C++ linker is used. Nonetheless, you need to add
  a few more parameters to the link command line, depending on the exception
  mechanism used.

  If you are using the ``setjmp`` / ``longjmp`` exception mechanism, you need only
  inclue the paths to the ``libgcc`` libraries:

  .. code-block:: sh

    $ cat ./my_script
    #!/bin/sh
    CC $* gcc -print-file-name=libgcc.a gcc -print-file-name=libgcc_eh.a
    $ gnatlink ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=./my_script


  where CC is the name of the non-GNU C++ compiler.

  If you are using the "zero cost" exception mechanism and the platform
  supports automatic registration of exception tables (e.g., Solaris),
  you need to include paths to more objects:

  .. code-block:: sh

    $ cat ./my_script
    #!/bin/sh
    CC gcc -print-file-name=crtbegin.o $* \\
    gcc -print-file-name=libgcc.a gcc -print-file-name=libgcc_eh.a \\
    gcc -print-file-name=crtend.o
    $ gnatlink ada_unit file1.o file2.o --LINK=./my_script


  If you are using the "zero cost exception" mechanism is used and the platform
  doesn't support automatic registration of exception tables (e.g., HP-UX
  or AIX), the simple approach described above won't work and
  a you will need to preform a pre-linking phase using GNAT.


Another alternative is to use the :command:`gprbuild` multi-language builder
which has a large knowledge base and knows how to link Ada and C++ code
together automatically in most cases.

.. _A_Simple_Example:

A Simple Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example, provided as part of the GNAT examples, shows how
to achieve procedural interfacing between Ada and C++ in both
directions. The C++ class ``A`` has two methods. The first method is exported
to Ada by the means of an extern C wrapper function. The second method
calls an Ada subprogram. On the Ada side, the C++ calls are modelled by
a limited record with a layout comparable to the C++ class. The Ada
subprogram, in turn, calls the C++ method. So, starting from the C++
main program, execution passes back and forth between the two
languages.

Here are the compilation commands:

.. code-block:: sh

     $ gnatmake -c simple_cpp_interface
     $ g++ -c cpp_main.C
     $ g++ -c ex7.C
     $ gnatbind -n simple_cpp_interface
     $ gnatlink simple_cpp_interface -o cpp_main --LINK=g++ -lstdc++ ex7.o cpp_main.o

Here are the corresponding sources:

.. code-block:: cpp

     //cpp_main.C

     #include "ex7.h"

     extern "C" {
       void adainit (void);
       void adafinal (void);
       void method1 (A *t);
     }

     void method1 (A *t)
     {
       t->method1 ();
     }

     int main ()
     {
       A obj;
       adainit ();
       obj.method2 (3030);
       adafinal ();
     }

.. code-block:: cpp

     class Origin {

     };

     void A::method1 (void)
     {
       a_value = 2020;
       printf ("in A::method1, a_value = %d \\n",a_value);
     }

     void A::method2 (int v)
     {
        ada_method2 (this, v);
        printf ("in A::method2, a_value = %d \\n",a_value);
     }

     A::A(void)
     {
        a_value = 1010;

     }

           This.A_Value := V;
        end Ada_Method2;

     end Simple_Cpp_Interface;


.. _Interfacing_with_C++_constructors:

Interfacing with C++ constructors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To interface with C++ constructors GNAT provides the
``pragma CPP_Constructor`` (see the :title:`GNAT_Reference_Manual`
for additional information).
In this section, we present some common uses of C++ constructors
in mixed-languages programs in GNAT.

Let us assume we need to interface with the following
C++ class:

.. code-block:: cpp

     class Root {
     public:
       int  a_value;
       int  b_value;
       virtual int Get_Value ();
       Root();              // Default constructor
       Root(int v);         // 1st non-default constructor
       Root(int v, int w);  // 2nd non-default constructor
     };

For this purpose, we can write the following package spec (further
information on how to build this spec is available in
:ref:`Interfacing_with_C++_at_the_Class_Level` and
:ref:`Generating_Ada_Bindings_for_C_and_C++_headers`).

.. code-block:: ada

     with Interfaces.C; use Interfaces.C;
     package Pkg_Root is
       type Root is tagged limited record
          A_Value : int;
          B_Value : int;
       end record;
       pragma Import (CPP, Root);

       function Get_Value (Obj : Root) return int;
       pragma Import (CPP, Get_Value);

       function Constructor return Root;
       pragma Cpp_Constructor (Constructor, "_ZN4RootC1Ev");

       function Constructor (v : Integer) return Root;
       pragma Cpp_Constructor (Constructor, "_ZN4RootC1Ei");

       function Constructor (v, w : Integer) return Root;
       pragma Cpp_Constructor (Constructor, "_ZN4RootC1Eii");
     end Pkg_Root;

On the Ada side, the constructor is represented by a function (whose
name is arbitrary) that returns the classwide type corresponding to
the imported C++ class. Although the constructor is described as a
function, it's typically a procedure with an extra implicit argument
(the object being initialized) at the implementation level. GNAT
issues the appropriate call, whatever it is, to get the object
properly initialized.

Constructors can only appear in the following contexts:

* On the right side of an initialization of an object of type.
* On the right side of an initialization of a record component of type.
* In an Ada 2005 limited aggregate.
* In an Ada 2005 nested limited aggregate.
* In an Ada 2005 limited aggregate that initializes an object built in
  place by an extended return statement.

In a declaration of an object whose type is a class imported from C++,
either the default C++ constructor is implicitly called by GNAT or you must
explicitly call the required C++ constructor in the
expression that initializes the object. For example:

.. code-block:: ada

     Obj1 : Root;
     Obj2 : Root := Constructor;
     Obj3 : Root := Constructor (v => 10);
     Obj4 : Root := Constructor (30, 40);

The first two declarations are equivalent: in both cases the default C++
constructor is invoked (in the former case the call to the constructor is
implicit and in the latter case the call is explicit in the object
declaration). ``Obj3`` is initialized by the C++ non-default constructor
that takes an integer argument and ``Obj4`` is initialized by the
non-default C++ constructor that takes two integers.

Let's derive the imported C++ class in the Ada side. For example:

.. code-block:: ada

     type DT is new Root with record
        C_Value : Natural := 2009;
     end record;

In this case, you must initialize the components ``DT`` inherited from
the C++ side by a C++ constructor and the additional Ada components
of type DT are initialized by GNAT. The initialization of such an
object is done either by default, or by means of a function returning
an aggregate of type DT, or by means of an extension aggregate.

.. code-block:: ada

     Obj5 : DT;
     Obj6 : DT := Function_Returning_DT (50);
     Obj7 : DT := (Constructor (30,40) with C_Value => 50);

The declaration of ``Obj5`` invokes the default constructors: the
C++ default constructor of the parent type takes care of the initialization
of the components inherited from Root and GNAT takes care of the default
initialization of the additional Ada components of type DT (that is,
``C_Value`` is initialized to value 2009). The order of invocation of
the constructors is consistent with the order of elaboration required by
Ada and C++. That is, the constructor of the parent type is always called
before the constructor of the derived type.

Let's now consider a record that has components whose type is imported
from C++. For example:

.. code-block:: ada

     type Rec1 is limited record
        Data1 : Root := Constructor (10);
        Value : Natural := 1000;
     end record;

     type Rec2 (D : Integer := 20) is limited record
        Rec   : Rec1;
        Data2 : Root := Constructor (D, 30);
     end record;

The initialization of an object of type ``Rec2`` calls the non-default
C++ constructors specified for the imported components.  For example:

.. code-block:: ada

     Obj8 : Rec2 (40);

Using Ada 2005, we can use limited aggregates to initialize an object
invoking C++ constructors that differ from those specified in the type
declarations. For example:

.. code-block:: ada

     Obj9 : Rec2 := (Rec => (Data1 => Constructor (15, 16),
                             others => <>),
                     others => <>);

The above declaration uses an Ada 2005 limited aggregate to
initialize ``Obj9`` and the C++ constructor that has two integer
arguments is invoked to initialize the ``Data1`` component instead
of the constructor specified in the declaration of type ``Rec1``. In
Ada 2005, the box in the aggregate indicates that unspecified components
are initialized using the expression (if any) available in the component
declaration. That is, in this case discriminant ``D`` is initialized
to value ``20``, ``Value`` is initialized to value 1000, and the
non-default C++ constructor that handles two integers takes care of
initializing component ``Data2`` with values ``20,30``.

In Ada 2005, we can use the extended return statement to build the Ada
equivalent to C++ non-default constructors. For example:

.. code-block:: ada

     function Constructor (V : Integer) return Rec2 is
     begin
        return Obj : Rec2 := (Rec => (Data1  => Constructor (V, 20),
                                      others => <>),
                              others => <>) do
           --  Further actions required for construction of
           --  objects of type Rec2
           ...
        end record;
     end Constructor;

In this example, we use the extended return statement construct to
build in place the returned object whose components are initialized by
means of a limited aggregate. We could also place any further action
associated with the constructor inside the construct.

.. _Interfacing_with_C++_at_the_Class_Level:

Interfacing with C++ at the Class Level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we demonstrate the GNAT features for interfacing with
C++ by means of an example making use of Ada 2005 abstract interface
types. This example consists of a classification of animals; classes
have been used to model our main classification of animals and
interfaces provide support for the management of secondary
classifications. We first demonstrate a case in which the types and
constructors are defined on the C++ side and imported from the Ada
side and then the reverse case.

The root of our derivation is the ``Animal`` class, with a
single private attribute (the ``Age`` of the animal), a constructor,
and two public primitives to set and get the value of this attribute.

.. code-block:: cpp

     class Animal {
      public:
        virtual void Set_Age (int New_Age);
        virtual int Age ();
        Animal() {Age_Count = 0;};
      private:
        int Age_Count;
     };

Abstract interface types are defined in C++ by means of classes with pure
virtual functions and no data members. In our example we use two
interfaces that provide support for the common management of ``Carnivore``
and ``Domestic`` animals:

.. code-block:: cpp

     class Carnivore {
     public:
        virtual int Number_Of_Teeth () = 0;
     };

     class Domestic {
     public:
        virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name) = 0;
     };

Using these declarations, we can now say that a ``Dog`` is an animal that is
both Carnivore and Domestic, that is:

.. code-block:: cpp

     class Dog : Animal, Carnivore, Domestic {
      public:
        virtual int  Number_Of_Teeth ();
        virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name);

        Dog(); // Constructor
      private:
        int  Tooth_Count;
        char *Owner;
     };

In the following examples we assume that the previous declarations are
located in a file named :file:`animals.h`. The following package demonstrates
how to import these C++ declarations from the Ada side:

.. code-block:: ada

     with Interfaces.C.Strings; use Interfaces.C.Strings;
     package Animals is
       type Carnivore is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Carnivore);
       function Number_Of_Teeth (X : Carnivore)
          return Natural is abstract;

       type Domestic is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Domestic);
       procedure Set_Owner
         (X    : in out Domestic;
          Name : Chars_Ptr) is abstract;

       type Animal is tagged limited record
         Age : Natural;
       end record;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Animal);

       procedure Set_Age (X : in out Animal; Age : Integer);
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Age);

       function Age (X : Animal) return Integer;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Age);

       function New_Animal return Animal;
       pragma CPP_Constructor (New_Animal);
       pragma Import (CPP, New_Animal, "_ZN6AnimalC1Ev");

       type Dog is new Animal and Carnivore and Domestic with record
         Tooth_Count : Natural;
         Owner       : Chars_Ptr;
       end record;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Dog);

       function Number_Of_Teeth (A : Dog) return Natural;
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Number_Of_Teeth);

       procedure Set_Owner (A : in out Dog; Name : Chars_Ptr);
       pragma Import (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Owner);

       function New_Dog return Dog;
       pragma CPP_Constructor (New_Dog);
       pragma Import (CPP, New_Dog, "_ZN3DogC2Ev");
     end Animals;

Thanks to the compatibility between GNAT run-time structures and the
C++ ABI, interfacing with these C++ classes is easy. The only
requirement is that you must declare all the primitives and components
exactly in the same order in the two languages.

Regarding the abstract interfaces, we must indicate to the GNAT
compiler, by means of a ``pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus)``, that the
convention used to pass the arguments to the called primitives will be
the same as for C++. For the imported classes, we use ``pragma
Import`` with convention ``C_Plus_Plus`` to indicate they have been
defined on the C++ side; this is required because the dispatch table
associated with these tagged types will be built in the C++ side and
therefore will not contain the predefined Ada primitives which Ada
would otherwise expect.

As the reader can see, there is no need to indicate the C++ mangled names
associated with each subprogram because it is assumed that all the calls to
these primitives will be dispatching calls. The only exception is the
constructor, which we must register with the compiler by means of
``pragma CPP_Constructor`` and we need to provide its associated C++
mangled name because the Ada compiler generates direct calls to it.

With the above packages, we can now declare objects of type ``Dog`` on
the Ada side and dispatch calls to the corresponding subprograms on
the C++ side. We can also extend the tagged type ``Dog`` with further
fields and primitives and override some of its C++ primitives on the
Ada side. For example, here we have a type derivation defined on the
Ada side that inherits all the dispatching primitives of the ancestor
from the C++ side.

.. code-block:: ada

     with Animals; use Animals;
     package Vaccinated_Animals is
       type Vaccinated_Dog is new Dog with null record;
       function Vaccination_Expired (A : Vaccinated_Dog) return Boolean;
     end Vaccinated_Animals;

It is important to note that, because of the ABI compatibility, we
don't need to add any further information to indicate either the object
layout or the dispatch table entry associated with each dispatching operation.

Now let's define all the types and constructors on the Ada side and export
them to C++, using the same hierarchy of our previous example:

.. code-block:: ada

     with Interfaces.C.Strings;
     use Interfaces.C.Strings;
     package Animals is
       type Carnivore is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Carnivore);
       function Number_Of_Teeth (X : Carnivore)
          return Natural is abstract;

       type Domestic is limited interface;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Domestic);
       procedure Set_Owner
         (X    : in out Domestic;
          Name : Chars_Ptr) is abstract;

       type Animal is tagged record
         Age : Natural;
       end record;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Animal);

       procedure Set_Age (X : in out Animal; Age : Integer);
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Age);

       function Age (X : Animal) return Integer;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Age);

       function New_Animal return Animal'Class;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, New_Animal);

       type Dog is new Animal and Carnivore and Domestic with record
         Tooth_Count : Natural;
         Owner       : String (1 .. 30);
       end record;
       pragma Convention (C_Plus_Plus, Dog);

       function Number_Of_Teeth (A : Dog) return Natural;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Number_Of_Teeth);

       procedure Set_Owner (A : in out Dog; Name : Chars_Ptr);
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, Set_Owner);

       function New_Dog return Dog'Class;
       pragma Export (C_Plus_Plus, New_Dog);
     end Animals;

Compared with our previous example the only differences are the use of
``pragma Convention`` (instead of ``pragma Import``) and the use of
``pragma Export`` to indicate to the GNAT compiler that the primitives will
be available to C++. Thanks to the ABI compatibility, on the C++ side there is
nothing else to be done; as explained above, the only requirement is that all
the primitives and components are declared in exactly the same order.

For completeness, let us see a brief C++ main program that uses the
declarations available in :file:`animals.h` (presented in our first example) to
import and use the declarations from the Ada side, properly initializing and
finalizing the Ada run-time system along the way:

.. code-block:: cpp

     #include "animals.h"
     #include <iostream>
     using namespace std;

     void Check_Carnivore (Carnivore *obj) {...}
     void Check_Domestic (Domestic *obj)   {...}
     void Check_Animal (Animal *obj)       {...}
     void Check_Dog (Dog *obj)             {...}

     extern "C" {
       void adainit (void);
       void adafinal (void);
       Dog* new_dog ();
     }

     void test ()
     {
       Dog *obj = new_dog();  // Ada constructor
       Check_Carnivore (obj); // Check secondary DT
       Check_Domestic (obj);  // Check secondary DT
       Check_Animal (obj);    // Check primary DT
       Check_Dog (obj);       // Check primary DT
     }

     int main ()
     {
       adainit ();  test();  adafinal ();
       return 0;
     }

.. _Partition_Wide_Settings:

Partition-Wide Settings
-----------------------

When building a mixed-language application, you must be aware that
Ada enforces some partition-wide settings that may implicitly impact the
behavior of the other languages.

This is the case for certain signals that are reserved to the
implementation to implement proper Ada semantics (such as the behavior
of ``abort`` statements).
It means that the Ada part of the application may override signal handlers
that were previously installed by either the system or by other user code.

If your application requires that either system or user signals be preserved,
you need to instruct the Ada part not to install its own signal handler.
You do this using ``pragma Interrupt_State`` that provides a general
mechanism for overriding such uses of interrupts.

Additionally, you can use pragma ``Interrupts_System_By_Default`` to default
all interrupts to System.

The set of interrupts for which the Ada run-time library sets a specific signal
handler is the following:

* Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGSEGV
* Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGBUS
* Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGFPE
* Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGILL
* Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGABRT

You can instruct the run-time library not to install its signal
handler for a particular signal by using the configuration pragma
``Interrupt_State`` in the Ada code. For example:

.. code-block:: ada

   pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGSEGV, System);
   pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGBUS,  System);
   pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGFPE,  System);
   pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGILL,  System);
   pragma Interrupt_State (Ada.Interrupts.Names.SIGABRT, System);

Obviously, if the Ada run-time system cannot set these handlers it comes with the
drawback of not fully preserving Ada semantics. ``SIGSEGV``, ``SIGBUS``, ``SIGFPE``
and ``SIGILL`` are used to raise corresponding Ada exceptions in the application,
while ``SIGABRT`` is used to asynchronously abort an action or a task.

.. _Generating_Ada_Bindings_for_C_and_C++_headers:

Generating Ada Bindings for C and C++ headers
---------------------------------------------

.. index:: Binding generation (for C and C++ headers)
.. index:: C headers (binding generation)
.. index:: C++ headers (binding generation)

GNAT includes a binding generator for C and C++ headers, which is
intended to do 95% of the tedious work of generating Ada specs from C
or C++ header files.

This capability is not intended to generate 100% correct Ada specs and
it will in some cases require you to make manual adjustments, although
it can often be used out of the box in practice.

Some of the known limitations include:

* only very simple character constant macros are translated into Ada
  constants. Function macros (macros with arguments) are partially translated
  as comments, to be completed manually if needed.
* some extensions (e.g. vector types) are not supported
* pointers to pointers are mapped to ``System.Address``
* identifiers with names that are identical except for casing may generate
  compilation errors (e.g. ``shm_get`` vs ``SHM_GET``).

The code is generated using Ada 2012 syntax, which makes it easier to interface
with other languages. In most cases, you can still use the generated binding
even if your code is compiled using earlier versions of Ada (e.g. ``-gnat95``).

.. _Running_the_binding_generator:

Running the Binding Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The binding generator is part of the ``gcc`` compiler and you can
invoke it via the :switch:`-fdump-ada-spec` switch, which generates Ada
spec files for the header files specified on the command line and all
header files needed by these files transitively. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gcc -c -fdump-ada-spec -C /usr/include/time.h
      $ gcc -c *.ads

generates, under GNU/Linux, the following files: :file:`time_h.ads`,
:file:`bits_time_h.ads`, :file:`stddef_h.ads`, :file:`bits_types_h.ads` which
correspond to the files :file:`/usr/include/time.h`, and
:file:`/usr/include/bits/time.h` and then compile these Ada specs.
The name of the Ada specs is consistent with the relative path
under :file:`/usr/include/` of the header files. This behavior is specific to
paths ending with :file:`/include/`; in all the other cases, the name of the
Ada specs is derived from the simple name of the header files instead.

The :switch:`-C` switch tells ``gcc`` to extract comments from headers,
and attempt to generate corresponding Ada comments.

If you want to generate a single Ada file and not the transitive closure, you
can use instead the :switch:`-fdump-ada-spec-slim` switch.

You can optionally specify a parent unit, of which all generated units will
be children, using :switch:`-fada-spec-parent={unit}`.

The simple ``gcc``-based command works only for C headers. For C++ headers
you need to use either the ``g++`` command or the combination ``gcc -x c++``.

In some cases, the generated bindings will be more complete or more meaningful
when defining some macros, which you can do via the :switch:`-D` switch. This
is for example the case with :file:`Xlib.h` under GNU/Linux:

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gcc -c -fdump-ada-spec -DXLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS -C /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h

The above generates more complete bindings than a call without
the :switch:`-DXLIB_ILLEGAL_ACCESS` switch.

In other cases, you can't parse a header file in a stand-alone
manner because other include files need to be included first. In this
case, the solution is to create a small header file including the needed
``#include`` and possible ``#define`` directives. For example, to
generate Ada bindings for :file:`readline/readline.h`, you need to first
include :file:`stdio.h`, so you can create a file with the following two
lines in e.g. :file:`readline1.h`:

.. code-block:: cpp

      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <readline/readline.h>

and then generate Ada bindings from this file:

.. code-block:: sh

      $ gcc -c -fdump-ada-spec readline1.h


.. _Generating_bindings_for_C++_headers:

Generating Bindings for C++ Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generating bindings for C++ headers is done using the same options, but
with the ``g++`` compiler. Note that generating Ada spec from C++ headers is a
much more complex job and support for C++ headers is much more limited that
support for C headers. As a result, you will need to modify the resulting
bindings by hand more extensively when using C++ headers.

In this mode, C++ classes are mapped to Ada tagged types, constructors
are mapped using the ``CPP_Constructor`` pragma, and when possible,
multiple inheritance of abstract classes are mapped to Ada interfaces
(see the *Interfacing to C++* section in the :title:`GNAT Reference Manual`
for additional information on interfacing to C++).

For example, given the following C++ header file:

.. code-block:: cpp

       class Carnivore {
       public:
          virtual int Number_Of_Teeth () = 0;
       };

       class Domestic {
       public:
          virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name) = 0;
       };

       class Animal {
       public:
         int Age_Count;
         virtual void Set_Age (int New_Age);
       };

       class Dog : Animal, Carnivore, Domestic {
        public:
         int  Tooth_Count;
         char *Owner;

         virtual int  Number_Of_Teeth ();
         virtual void Set_Owner (char* Name);

         Dog();
       };

The corresponding Ada code is generated:

.. code-block:: ada

         package Class_Carnivore is
           type Carnivore is limited interface;
           pragma Import (CPP, Carnivore);

           function Number_Of_Teeth (this : access Carnivore) return int is abstract;
         end;
         use Class_Carnivore;

         package Class_Domestic is
           type Domestic is limited interface;
           pragma Import (CPP, Domestic);

           procedure Set_Owner
             (this : access Domestic;
              Name : Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr) is abstract;
         end;
         use Class_Domestic;

         package Class_Animal is
           type Animal is tagged limited record
             Age_Count : aliased int;
           end record;
           pragma Import (CPP, Animal);

           procedure Set_Age (this : access Animal; New_Age : int);
           pragma Import (CPP, Set_Age, "_ZN6Animal7Set_AgeEi");
         end;
         use Class_Animal;

         package Class_Dog is
           type Dog is new Animal and Carnivore and Domestic with record
             Tooth_Count : aliased int;
             Owner : Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr;
           end record;
           pragma Import (CPP, Dog);

           function Number_Of_Teeth (this : access Dog) return int;
           pragma Import (CPP, Number_Of_Teeth, "_ZN3Dog15Number_Of_TeethEv");

           procedure Set_Owner
             (this : access Dog; Name : Interfaces.C.Strings.chars_ptr);
           pragma Import (CPP, Set_Owner, "_ZN3Dog9Set_OwnerEPc");

           function New_Dog return Dog;
           pragma CPP_Constructor (New_Dog);
           pragma Import (CPP, New_Dog, "_ZN3DogC1Ev");
         end;
         use Class_Dog;


.. _Switches_for_Ada_Binding_Generation:

Switches
^^^^^^^^

.. index:: -fdump-ada-spec (gcc)

:switch:`-fdump-ada-spec`
  Generate Ada spec files for the given header files transitively (including
  all header files that these headers depend upon).

.. index:: -fdump-ada-spec-slim (gcc)

:switch:`-fdump-ada-spec-slim`
  Only generate Ada spec files for the header files specified on the
  command line.

.. index:: -fada-spec-parent (gcc)

:switch:`-fada-spec-parent={unit}`
  Specifies that all files generated by :switch:`-fdump-ada-spec` are
  to be child units of the specified parent unit.

.. index:: -C (gcc)

:switch:`-C`
  Extract comments from headers and generate Ada comments in the Ada spec files.

.. _Generating_C_Headers_for_Ada_Specifications:

Generating C Headers for Ada Specifications
-------------------------------------------

.. index:: Binding generation (for Ada specs)
.. index:: C headers (binding generation)

GNAT includes a C header generator for Ada specifications that
supports Ada types that have a direct mapping to C types. This
specifically includes support for:

* Scalar types
* Constrained arrays
* Records (untagged)
* Composition of the above types
* Constant declarations
* Object declarations
* Subprogram declarations

Running the C Header Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The C header generator is part of the GNAT compiler and can be invoked via
the :switch:`-gnatceg` switch, which generates a :file:`.h`
file corresponding to the given input file (Ada spec or body). Note that
only spec files are processed, so giving a spec or a body file
as input is equivalent. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ gcc -c -gnatceg pack1.ads

generates a self-contained file called :file:`pack1.h` including
common definitions from the Ada Standard package followed by the
definitions included in :file:`pack1.ads` as well as all the other units
withed by this file.

For instance, given the following Ada files:

.. code-block:: ada

   package Pack2 is
      type Int is range 1 .. 10;
   end Pack2;

.. code-block:: ada

   with Pack2;

   package Pack1 is
      type Rec is record
         Field1, Field2 : Pack2.Int;
      end record;

      Global : Rec := (1, 2);

      procedure Proc1 (R : Rec);
      procedure Proc2 (R : in out Rec);
   end Pack1;

The above ``gcc`` command generates the following :file:`pack1.h` file:

.. code-block:: c

   /* Standard definitions skipped */
   #ifndef PACK2_ADS
   #define PACK2_ADS
   typedef short_short_integer pack2__TintB;
   typedef pack2__TintB pack2__int;
   #endif /* PACK2_ADS */

   #ifndef PACK1_ADS
   #define PACK1_ADS
   typedef struct _pack1__rec {
     pack2__int field1;
     pack2__int field2;
   } pack1__rec;
   extern pack1__rec pack1__global;
   extern void pack1__proc1(const pack1__rec r);
   extern void pack1__proc2(pack1__rec *r);
   #endif /* PACK1_ADS */

You can then ``include`` :file:`pack1.h` from a C source file and use the types,
call subprograms, reference objects, and constants.

.. _GNAT_and_Other_Compilation_Models:

GNAT and Other Compilation Models
=================================

This section compares the GNAT model with the approaches taken in
other environments: first the C/C++ model and then the mechanism that
has been used in other Ada systems, in particular those traditionally
used for Ada 83.

.. _Comparison_between_GNAT_and_C/C++_Compilation_Models:

Comparison between GNAT and C/C++ Compilation Models
----------------------------------------------------

The GNAT compilation model is close to the C and C++ models. You can
think of Ada specs as corresponding to header files in C. As in C, you
don't need to compile specs; they are compiled when they are used. The
Ada |with| is similar in effect to the ``#include`` of a C header.

One notable difference is that, in Ada, you may compile specs separately
to check them for semantic and syntactic accuracy. This is not always
possible with C headers because they are fragments of programs that have
less specific syntactic or semantic rules.

The other major difference is the requirement for running the binder,
which performs two important functions. First, it checks for
consistency. In C or C++, the only defense against assembling
inconsistent programs lies outside the compiler, in a :file:`makefile`, for
example. The binder satisfies the Ada requirement that it be impossible
to construct an inconsistent program when the compiler is used in normal
mode.

.. index:: Elaboration order control

The other important function of the binder is to deal with elaboration
issues. There are also elaboration issues in C++ that are handled
automatically. This automatic handling has the advantage of being
simpler to use, but the C++ programmer has no control over elaboration.
Where ``gnatbind`` might complain there was no valid order of
elaboration, a C++ compiler would simply construct a program that
malfunctioned at run time.

.. _Comparison_between_GNAT_and_Conventional_Ada_Library_Models:

Comparison between GNAT and Conventional Ada Library Models
-----------------------------------------------------------

This section is intended for Ada programmers who have
used an Ada compiler implementing the traditional Ada library
model, as described in the Ada Reference Manual.

.. index:: GNAT library

In GNAT, there is no 'library' in the normal sense. Instead, the set of
source files themselves acts as the library. Compiling Ada programs does
not generate any centralized information, but rather an object file and
a :file:`.ali` file, which are of interest only to the binder and linker.
In a traditional system, the compiler reads information not only from
the source file being compiled but also from the centralized library.
This means that the effect of a compilation depends on what has been
previously compiled. In particular:

* When a unit is |withed|, the unit seen by the compiler corresponds
  to the version of the unit most recently compiled into the library.

* Inlining is effective only if the necessary body has already been
  compiled into the library.

* Compiling a unit may obsolete other units in the library.

In GNAT, compiling one unit never affects the compilation of any other
units because the compiler reads only source files. Only changes to source
files can affect the results of a compilation. In particular:

* When a unit is |withed|, the unit seen by the compiler corresponds
  to the source version of the unit that is currently accessible to the
  compiler.

  .. index:: Inlining

* Inlining requires the appropriate source files for the package or
  subprogram bodies to be available to the compiler. Inlining is always
  effective, independent of the order in which units are compiled.

* Compiling a unit never affects any other compilations. The editing of
  sources may cause previous compilations to be out of date if they
  depended on the source file being modified.

The most important result of these differences is that order of compilation
is never significant in GNAT. There is no situation in which you are
required to do one compilation before another. What shows up as order of
compilation requirements in the traditional Ada library becomes, in
GNAT, simple source dependencies; in other words, there is only a set
of rules saying what source files must be present when a file is
compiled.


.. _Using_GNAT_Files_with_External_Tools:

Using GNAT Files with External Tools
====================================

This section explains how files that are produced by GNAT may be
used with tools designed for other languages.


.. _Using_Other_Utility_Programs_with_GNAT:

Using Other Utility Programs with GNAT
--------------------------------------

The object files generated by GNAT are in standard system format and, in
particular, the debugging information uses this format. This means
programs generated by GNAT can be used with existing utilities that
depend on these formats.

In general, any utility program that works with C will also often work with
Ada programs generated by GNAT. This includes software utilities such as
``gprof`` (a profiling program), ``gdb`` (the FSF debugger), and utilities such
as ``Purify``.


.. _The_External_Symbol_Naming_Scheme_of_GNAT:

The External Symbol Naming Scheme of GNAT
-----------------------------------------

To interpret the output from GNAT when using tools that are
originally intended for use with other languages, you need to
understand the conventions used to generate link names from the Ada
entity names.

All link names are in all lowercase. With the exception of library
procedure names, the mechanism used is simply to use the full expanded
Ada name with dots replaced by double underscores. For example, suppose
we have the following package spec:

.. code-block:: ada

     package QRS is
        MN : Integer;
     end QRS;

.. index:: pragma Export

The variable ``MN`` has a full expanded Ada name of ``QRS.MN``, so
the corresponding link name is ``qrs__mn``.
Of course if you use a pragma ``Export``, you maye override this:

.. code-block:: ada

     package Exports is
        Var1 : Integer;
        pragma Export (Var1, C, External_Name => "var1_name");
        Var2 : Integer;
        pragma Export (Var2, C, Link_Name => "var2_link_name");
     end Exports;

In this case, the link name for ``Var1`` is whatever link name the
C compiler would assign for the C function ``var1_name``. This typically
would be either ``var1_name`` or ``_var1_name``, depending on operating
system conventions, but other possibilities exist. The link name for
``Var2`` is ``var2_link_name``, and this is not operating system
dependent.

One exception occurs for library level procedures. A potential ambiguity
arises between the required name ``_main`` for the C main program,
and the name we would otherwise assign to an Ada library level procedure
called ``Main`` (which might well not be the main program).

To avoid this ambiguity, GNAT adds the prefix ``_ada_`` to such
names. So if we have a library level procedure such as:

.. code-block:: ada

     procedure Hello (S : String);

the external name of this procedure is ``_ada_hello``.
