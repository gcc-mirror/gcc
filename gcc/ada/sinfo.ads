--  This package documents the structure of the abstract syntax tree. The Atree
--  package provides a basic tree structure. Sinfo describes how this structure
--  is used to represent the syntax of an Ada program.

--  The grammar in the RM is followed very closely in the tree design, and is
--  repeated as part of this source file.

--  The tree contains not only the full syntactic representation of the
--  program, but also the results of semantic analysis. In particular, the
--  nodes for defining identifiers, defining character literals, and defining
--  operator symbols, collectively referred to as entities, represent what
--  would normally be regarded as the symbol table information. In addition a
--  number of the tree nodes contain semantic information.

--  See the spec of Gen_IL.Gen for instructions on making changes to this file.
--  Note that the official definition of what nodes have what fields is in
--  Gen_IL.Gen.Gen_Nodes; if there is a discrepancy between that and the
--  comments here, Gen_IL.Gen.Gen_Nodes wins.

   -- Definitions of fields in tree node --
   ----------------------------------------

   --  The following fields are common to all nodes:

   --   Nkind         Indicates the kind of the node. This field is present
   --                 in all nodes.

   --   Sloc          Location (Source_Ptr) of the corresponding token
   --                 in the Source buffer. The individual node definitions
   --                 show which token is referenced by this pointer.

   --   In_List       A flag used to indicate if the node is a member
   --                 of a node list (see package Nlists).

   --   Rewrite_Ins   A flag set if a node is marked as a rewrite inserted
   --                 node as a result of a call to Mark_Rewrite_Insertion.

   --   Small_Paren_Count
   --                 A 2-bit count used in subexpression nodes to indicate
   --                 the level of parentheses. The settings are 0,1,2 and
   --                 3 for many. If the value is 3, then an auxiliary table
   --                 is used to indicate the real value, which is computed by
   --                 Paren_Count. Set to zero for nonsubexpression nodes.

   --                 Note: the required parentheses surrounding conditional
   --                 and quantified expressions count as a level of parens
   --                 for this purpose, so e.g. in X := (if A then B else C);
   --                 Paren_Count for the right side will be 1.

   --   Comes_From_Source
   --                 This flag is present in all nodes. It is set if the
   --                 node is built by the scanner or parser, and clear if
   --                 the node is built by the analyzer or expander. It
   --                 indicates that the node corresponds to a construct
   --                 that appears in the original source program.

   --   Analyzed      This flag is present in all nodes. It is set when
   --                 a node is analyzed, and is used to avoid analyzing
   --                 the same node twice. Analysis includes expansion if
   --                 expansion is active, so in this case if the flag is
   --                 set it means the node has been analyzed and expanded.

   --   Error_Posted  This flag is present in all nodes. It is set when
   --                 an error message is posted which is associated with
   --                 the flagged node. This is used to avoid posting more
   --                 than one message on the same node.

   --   Link          For a node, points to the Parent. For a list, points
   --                 to the list header. Note that in the latter case, a
   --                 client cannot modify the link field. This field is
   --                 private to the Atree package (but is also modified
   --                 by the Nlists package).

   --  The following additional fields are common to all entities (that is,
   --  nodes whose Nkind is in N_Entity):

   --   Ekind         Entity type.

   --   Convention    Entity convention (Convention_Id value)

   --------------------------------
   -- Implicit Nodes in the Tree --
   --------------------------------

   --  Generally the structure of the tree very closely follows the grammar as
   --  defined in the RM. However, certain nodes are omitted to save space and
   --  simplify semantic processing. Two general classes of such omitted nodes
   --  are as follows:

   --   If the only possibilities for a non-terminal are one or more other
   --   non-terminals (i.e. the rule is a "skinny" rule), then usually the
   --   corresponding node is omitted from the tree, and the target construct
   --   appears directly. For example, a real type definition is either
   --   floating point definition or a fixed point definition. No explicit node
   --   appears for real type definition. Instead either the floating point
   --   definition or fixed point definition appears directly.

   --   If a non-terminal corresponds to a list of some other non-terminal
   --   (possibly with separating punctuation), then usually it is omitted from
   --   the tree, and a list of components appears instead. For example,
   --   sequence of statements does not appear explicitly in the tree. Instead
   --   a list of statements appears directly.

   --  Some additional cases of omitted nodes occur and are documented
   --  individually. In particular, many nodes are omitted in the tree
   --  generated for an expression.

   -------------------------------------------
   -- Handling of Defining Identifier Lists --
   -------------------------------------------

   --  In several declarative forms in the syntax, lists of defining
   --  identifiers appear (object declarations, component declarations, number
   --  declarations etc.)

   --  The semantics of such statements are equivalent to a series of identical
   --  declarations of single defining identifiers (except that conformance
   --  checks require the same grouping of identifiers in the parameter case).

   --  To simplify semantic processing, the parser breaks down such multiple
   --  declaration cases into sequences of single declarations, duplicating
   --  type and initialization information as required. The flags More_Ids and
   --  Prev_Ids are used to record the original form of the source in the case
   --  where the original source used a list of names, More_Ids being set on
   --  all but the last name and Prev_Ids being set on all but the first name.
   --  These flags are used to reconstruct the original source (e.g. in the
   --  Sprint package), and also are included in the conformance checks, but
   --  otherwise have no semantic significance.

   --  Note: the reason that we use More_Ids and Prev_Ids rather than
   --  First_Name and Last_Name flags is so that the flags are off in the
   --  normal one identifier case, which minimizes tree print output.

   -----------------------
   -- Use of Node Lists --
   -----------------------

   --  With a few exceptions, if a construction of the form {non-terminal}
   --  appears in the tree, lists are used in the corresponding tree node (see
   --  package Nlists for handling of node lists). In this case a field of the
   --  parent node points to a list of nodes for the non-terminal. The field
   --  name for such fields has a plural name which always ends in "s". For
   --  example, a case statement has a field Alternatives pointing to list of
   --  case statement alternative nodes.

   --  Only fields pointing to lists have names ending in "s", so generally the
   --  structure is strongly typed, fields not ending in s point to single
   --  nodes, and fields ending in s point to lists.

   --  The following example shows how a traversal of a list is written. We
   --  suppose here that Stmt points to a N_Case_Statement node which has a
   --  list field called Alternatives:

   --   Alt := First (Alternatives (Stmt));
   --   while Present (Alt) loop
   --      ..
   --      -- processing for case statement alternative Alt
   --      ..
   --      Alt := Next (Alt);
   --   end loop;

   --  The Present function tests for Empty, which in this case signals the end
   --  of the list. First returns Empty immediately if the list is empty.
   --  Present is defined in Atree; First and Next are defined in Nlists.

   --  The exceptions to this rule occur with {DEFINING_IDENTIFIERS} in all
   --  contexts, which is handled as described in the previous section, and
   --  with {,library_unit_NAME} in the N_With_Clause node, which is handled
   --  using the First_Name and Last_Name flags, as further detailed in the
   --  description of the N_With_Clause node.

   -------------
   -- Pragmas --
   -------------

   --  Pragmas can appear in many different context, but are not included in
   --  the grammar. Still they must appear in the tree, so they can be properly
   --  processed.

   --  Two approaches are used. In some cases, an extra field is defined in an
   --  appropriate node that contains a list of pragmas appearing in the
   --  expected context. For example pragmas can appear before an
   --  Accept_Alternative in a Selective_Accept_Statement, and these pragmas
   --  appear in the Pragmas_Before field of the N_Accept_Alternative node.

   --  The other approach is to simply allow pragmas to appear in syntactic
   --  lists where the grammar (of course) does not include the possibility.
   --  For example, the Variants field of an N_Variant_Part node points to a
   --  list that can contain both N_Pragma and N_Variant nodes.

   --  To make processing easier in the latter case, the Nlists package
   --  provides a set of routines (First_Non_Pragma, Last_Non_Pragma,
   --  Next_Non_Pragma, Prev_Non_Pragma) that allow such lists to be handled
   --  ignoring all pragmas.

   --  In the case of the variants list, we can either write:

   --      Variant := First (Variants (N));
   --      while Present (Variant) loop
   --         ...
   --         Variant := Next (Variant);
   --      end loop;

   --  or

   --      Variant := First_Non_Pragma (Variants (N));
   --      while Present (Variant) loop
   --         ...
   --         Variant := Next_Non_Pragma (Variant);
   --      end loop;

   --  In the first form of the loop, Variant can either be an N_Pragma or an
   --  N_Variant node. In the second form, Variant can only be N_Variant since
   --  all pragmas are skipped.

   ---------------------
   -- Optional Fields --
   ---------------------

   --  Fields which correspond to a section of the syntax enclosed in square
   --  brackets are generally omitted (and the corresponding field set to Empty
   --  for a node, or No_List for a list). The documentation of such fields
   --  notes these cases. One exception to this rule occurs in the case of
   --  possibly empty statement sequences (such as the sequence of statements
   --  in an entry call alternative). Such cases appear in the syntax rules as
   --  [SEQUENCE_OF_STATEMENTS] and the fields corresponding to such optional
   --  statement sequences always contain an empty list (not No_List) if no
   --  statements are present.

   --  Note: the utility program that constructs the body and spec of the Nmake
   --  package relies on the format of the comments to determine if a field
   --  should have a default value in the corresponding make routine. The rule
   --  is that if the first line of the description of the field contains the
   --  string "(set to xxx if", then a default value of xxx is provided for
   --  this field in the corresponding Make_yyy routine.

   -----------------------------------
   -- Note on Body/Spec Terminology --
   -----------------------------------

   --  In informal discussions about Ada, it is customary to refer to package
   --  and subprogram specs and bodies. However, this is not technically
   --  correct, what is normally referred to as a spec or specification is in
   --  fact a package declaration or subprogram declaration. We are careful in
   --  GNAT to use the correct terminology and in particular, the full word
   --  specification is never used as an incorrect substitute for declaration.
   --  The structure and terminology used in the tree also reflects the grammar
   --  and thus uses declaration and specification in the technically correct
   --  manner.

   --  However, there are contexts in which the informal terminology is useful.
   --  We have the word "body" to refer to the Interp_Etype declared by the
   --  declaration of a unit body, and in some contexts we need similar term to
   --  refer to the entity declared by the package or subprogram declaration,
   --  and simply using declaration can be confusing since the body also has a
   --  declaration.

   --  An example of such a context is the link between the package body and
   --  its declaration. With_Declaration is confusing, since the package body
   --  itself is a declaration.

   --  To deal with this problem, we reserve the informal term Spec, i.e. the
   --  popular abbreviation used in this context, to refer to the entity
   --  declared by the package or subprogram declaration. So in the above
   --  example case, the field in the body is called With_Spec.

   --  Another important context for the use of the word Spec is in error
   --  messages, where a hyper-correct use of declaration would be confusing to
   --  a typical Ada programmer, and even for an expert programmer can cause
   --  confusion since the body has a declaration as well.

   --  So, to summarize:

   --     Declaration    always refers to the syntactic entity that is called
   --                    a declaration. In particular, subprogram declaration
   --                    and package declaration are used to describe the
   --                    syntactic entity that includes the semicolon.

   --     Specification  always refers to the syntactic entity that is called
   --                    a specification. In particular, the terms procedure
   --                    specification, function specification, package
   --                    specification, subprogram specification always refer
   --                    to the syntactic entity that has no semicolon.

   --     Spec           is an informal term, used to refer to the entity
   --                    that is declared by a task declaration, protected
   --                    declaration, generic declaration, subprogram
   --                    declaration or package declaration.

   --  This convention is followed throughout the GNAT documentation
   --  both internal and external, and in all error message text.

   ------------------------
   -- Internal Use Nodes --
   ------------------------

   --  These are Node_Kind settings used in the internal implementation which
   --  are not logically part of the specification.

   --  N_Unused_At_Start
   --  Completely unused entry at the start of the enumeration type. This
   --  is inserted so that no legitimate value is zero, which helps to get
   --  better debugging behavior, since zero is a likely uninitialized value).

   --  N_Unused_At_End
   --  Completely unused entry at the end of the enumeration type. This is
   --  handy so that arrays with Node_Kind as the index type have an extra
   --  entry at the end (see for example the use of the Pchar_Pos_Array in
   --  Treepr, where the extra entry provides the limit value when dealing with
   --  the last used entry in the array).

   -----------------------------------------
   -- Note on the settings of Sloc fields --
   -----------------------------------------

   --  The Sloc field of nodes that come from the source is set by the parser.
   --  For internal nodes, and nodes generated during expansion the Sloc is
   --  usually set in the call to the constructor for the node. In general the
   --  Sloc value chosen for an internal node is the Sloc of the source node
   --  whose processing is responsible for the expansion. For example, the Sloc
   --  of an inherited primitive operation is the Sloc of the corresponding
   --  derived type declaration.

   --  For the nodes of a generic instantiation, the Sloc value is encoded to
   --  represent both the original Sloc in the generic unit, and the Sloc of
   --  the instantiation itself. See Sinput.ads for details.

   --  Subprogram instances create two callable entities: one is the visible
   --  subprogram instance, and the other is an anonymous subprogram nested
   --  within a wrapper package that contains the renamings for the actuals.
   --  Both of these entities have the Sloc of the defining entity in the
   --  instantiation node. This simplified for instance in the past some ASIS
   --  queries.

   -----------------------
   -- Field Definitions --
   -----------------------

   --  In the following node definitions, all fields, both syntactic and
   --  semantic, are documented. The one exception is in the case of entities
   --  (defining identifiers, character literals, and operator symbols), where
   --  the usage of the fields depends on the entity kind. Entity fields are
   --  fully documented in the separate package Einfo.

   --  In the node definitions, three common sets of fields are abbreviated to
   --  save both space in the documentation, and also space in the string
   --  (defined in Tree_Print_Strings) used to print trees. The following
   --  abbreviations are used:

   --    "plus fields for binary operator"
   --       Chars                     Name_Id for the operator
   --       Left_Opnd                 left operand expression
   --       Right_Opnd                right operand expression
   --       Entity                    defining entity for operator
   --       Associated_Node           for generic processing
   --       Do_Overflow_Check         set if overflow check needed
   --       Has_Private_View          set in generic units.

   --    "plus fields for unary operator"
   --       Chars                     Name_Id for the operator
   --       Right_Opnd                right operand expression
   --       Entity                    defining entity for operator
   --       Associated_Node           for generic processing
   --       Do_Overflow_Check         set if overflow check needed
   --       Has_Private_View          set in generic units.

   --    "plus fields for expression"
   --       Paren_Count               number of parentheses levels
   --       Etype                     type of the expression
   --       Is_Overloaded             >1 type interpretation exists
   --       Is_Static_Expression      set for static expression
   --       Raises_Constraint_Error   evaluation raises CE
   --       Must_Not_Freeze           set if must not freeze
   --       Do_Range_Check            set if a range check needed
   --       Has_Dynamic_Length_Check  set if length check inserted
   --       Assignment_OK             set if modification is OK
   --       Is_Controlling_Actual     set for controlling argument

   --  Note: see under (EXPRESSION) for further details on the use of
   --  the Paren_Count field to record the number of parentheses levels.

   --  Node_Kind is the type used in the Nkind field to indicate the node kind.
   --  The actual definition of this type is given later (the reason for this
   --  is that we want the descriptions ordered by logical chapter in the RM,
   --  but the type definition is reordered to facilitate the definition of
   --  some subtype ranges. The individual descriptions of the nodes show how
   --  the various fields are used in each node kind, as well as providing
   --  logical names for the fields. Functions and procedures are provided for
   --  accessing and setting these fields using these logical names.

   -----------------------
   -- Gigi Restrictions --
   -----------------------

   --  The tree passed to Gigi is more restricted than the general tree form.
   --  For example, as a result of expansion, most of the tasking nodes can
   --  never appear. For each node to which either a complete or partial
   --  restriction applies, a note entitled "Gigi restriction" appears which
   --  documents the restriction.

   --  Note that most of these restrictions apply only to trees generated when
   --  code is being generated, since they involved expander actions that
   --  destroy the tree.

   ----------------
   -- Ghost Mode --
   ----------------

   --  The SPARK RM 6.9 defines two classes of constructs - Ghost entities and
   --  Ghost statements. The intent of the feature is to treat Ghost constructs
   --  as non-existent when Ghost assertion policy Ignore is in effect.
   --
   --  The corresponding nodes which map to Ghost constructs are:
   --
   --    Ghost entities
   --      Declaration nodes
   --      N_Package_Body
   --      N_Subprogram_Body
   --
   --    Ghost statements
   --      N_Assignment_Statement
   --      N_Procedure_Call_Statement
   --      N_Pragma
   --
   --  In addition, the compiler treats instantiations as Ghost entities
   --
   --  To achieve the removal of ignored Ghost constructs, the compiler relies
   --  on global variables Ghost_Mode and Ignored_Ghost_Region, which comprise
   --  a mechanism called "Ghost regions".
   --
   --  The values of Ghost_Mode are as follows:
   --
   --    1. Check - All static semantics as defined in SPARK RM 6.9 are in
   --       effect. The Ghost region has mode Check.
   --
   --    2. Ignore - Same as Check, ignored Ghost code is not present in ALI
   --       files, object files, and the final executable. The Ghost region
   --       has mode Ignore.
   --
   --    3. None - No Ghost region is in effect
   --
   --  The value of Ignored_Ghost_Region captures the node which initiates an
   --  ignored Ghost region.
   --
   --  A Ghost region is a compiler operating mode, similar to Check_Syntax,
   --  however a region is much more finely grained and depends on the policy
   --  in effect. The region starts prior to the analysis of a Ghost construct
   --  and ends immediately after its expansion. The region is established as
   --  follows:
   --
   --    1. Declarations - Prior to analysis, if the declaration is subject to
   --       pragma Ghost.
   --
   --    2. Renaming declarations - Same as 1) or when the renamed entity is
   --       Ghost.
   --
   --    3. Completing declarations - Same as 1) or when the declaration is
   --       partially analyzed and the declaration completes a Ghost entity.
   --
   --    4. N_Package_Body, N_Subprogram_Body - Same as 1) or when the body is
   --       partially analyzed and completes a Ghost entity.
   --
   --    5. N_Assignment_Statement - After the left hand side is analyzed and
   --       references a Ghost entity.
   --
   --    6. N_Procedure_Call_Statement - After the name is analyzed and denotes
   --       a Ghost procedure.
   --
   --    7. N_Pragma - During analysis, when the related entity is Ghost or the
   --       pragma encloses a Ghost entity.
   --
   --    8. Instantiations - Save as 1) or when the instantiation is partially
   --       analyzed and the generic template is Ghost.
   --
   --  The following routines install a new Ghost region:
   --
   --     Install_Ghost_Region
   --     Mark_And_Set_Ghost_xxx
   --     Set_Ghost_Mode
   --
   --  The following routine ends a Ghost region:
   --
   --     Restore_Ghost_Region
   --
   --  A region may be reinstalled similarly to scopes for decoupled expansion
   --  such as the generation of dispatch tables or the creation of a predicate
   --  function.
   --
   --  If the mode of a Ghost region is Ignore, any newly created nodes as well
   --  as source entities are marked as ignored Ghost. In additon, the marking
   --  process signals all enclosing scopes that an ignored Ghost node resides
   --  within. The compilation unit where the node resides is also added to an
   --  auxiliary table for post processing.
   --
   --  After the analysis and expansion of all compilation units takes place
   --  as well as the instantiation of all inlined [generic] bodies, the GNAT
   --  driver initiates a separate pass which removes all ignored Ghost nodes
   --  from all units stored in the auxiliary table.

   --------------------
   -- GNATprove Mode --
   --------------------

   --  When a file is compiled in GNATprove mode (-gnatd.F), a very light
   --  expansion is performed and the analysis must generate a tree in a
   --  form that meets additional requirements.

   --  This light expansion does two transformations of the tree that cannot
   --  be postponed till after semantic analysis:

   --    1. Replace object renamings by renamed object. This requires the
   --       introduction of temporaries at the point of the renaming, which
   --       must be properly analyzed.

   --    2. Fully qualify entity names. This is needed to generate suitable
   --       local effects and call-graphs in ALI files, with the completely
   --       qualified names (in particular the suffix to distinguish homonyms).

   --  The tree after this light expansion should be fully analyzed
   --  semantically, which sometimes requires the insertion of semantic
   --  preanalysis, for example for subprogram contracts and pragma
   --  check/assert. In particular, all expressions must have their proper
   --  type, and semantic links should be set between tree nodes (partial to
   --  full view, etc.). Some kinds of nodes should be either absent, or can be
   --  ignored by the formal verification backend:

   --      N_Object_Renaming_Declaration: can be ignored safely
   --      N_Expression_Function:         absent (rewritten)
   --      N_Expression_With_Actions:     absent (not generated)

   --  SPARK cross-references are generated from the regular cross-references
   --  (used for browsing and code understanding) and additional references
   --  collected during semantic analysis, in particular on all dereferences.
   --  These SPARK cross-references are output in a separate section of ALI
   --  files, as described in spark_xrefs.adb. They are the basis for the
   --  computation of data dependences in GNATprove. This implies that all
   --  cross-references should be generated in this mode, even those that would
   --  not make sense from a user point-of-view, and that cross-references that
   --  do not lead to data dependences for subprograms can be safely ignored.

   --  GNATprove relies on the following front end behaviors:

   --    1. The first declarations in the list of visible declarations of
   --       a package declaration for a generic instance, up to the first
   --       declaration which comes from source, should correspond to
   --       the "mappings nodes" between formal and actual generic parameters.

   --    2. In addition pragma Debug statements are removed from the tree
   --       (rewritten to NULL stmt), since they should be ignored in formal
   --       verification.

   --    3. An error is also issued for missing subunits, similar to the
   --       warning issued when generating code, to avoid formal verification
   --       of a partial unit.

   --    4. Unconstrained types are not replaced by constrained types whose
   --       bounds are generated from an expression: Expand_Subtype_From_Expr
   --       should be a no-op.

   --    5. Errors (instead of warnings) are issued on compile-time-known
   --       constraint errors even though such cases do not correspond to
   --       illegalities in the Ada RM (this is simply another case where
   --       GNATprove implements a subset of the full language).
   --
   --       However, there are a few exceptions to this rule for cases where
   --       we want to allow the GNATprove analysis to proceed (e.g. range
   --       checks on empty ranges, which typically appear in deactivated
   --       code in a particular configuration).

   --    6. Subtypes should match in the AST, even after a generic is
   --       instantiated. In particular, GNATprove relies on the fact that,
   --       on a selected component, the type of the selected component is
   --       the type of the corresponding component in the prefix of the
   --       selected component.
   --
   --       Note that, in some cases, we know that this rule is broken by the
   --       frontend. In particular, if the selected component is a packed
   --       array depending on a discriminant of a unconstrained formal object
   --       parameter of a generic.

   ----------------
   -- SPARK Mode --
   ----------------

   --  The SPARK RM 1.6.5 defines a mode of operation called "SPARK mode" which
   --  starts a scope where the SPARK language semantics are either On, Off, or
   --  Auto, where Auto leaves the choice to the tools. A SPARK mode may be
   --  specified by means of an aspect or a pragma.

   --  The following entities may be subject to a SPARK mode. Entities marked
   --  with * may possess two differente SPARK modes.

   --     E_Entry
   --     E_Entry_Family
   --     E_Function
   --     E_Generic_Function
   --     E_Generic_Package *
   --     E_Generic_Procedure
   --     E_Operator
   --     E_Package *
   --     E_Package_Body *
   --     E_Procedure
   --     E_Protected_Body
   --     E_Protected_Subtype
   --     E_Protected_Type *
   --     E_Subprogram_Body
   --     E_Task_Body
   --     E_Task_Subtype
   --     E_Task_Type *
   --     E_Variable

   --  In order to manage SPARK scopes, the compiler relies on global variables
   --  SPARK_Mode and SPARK_Mode_Pragma and a mechanism called "SPARK regions."
   --  Routines Install_SPARK_Mode and Set_SPARK_Mode create a new SPARK region
   --  and routine Restore_SPARK_Mode ends a SPARK region. A region may be
   --  reinstalled similarly to scopes.

   -----------------------
   -- Check Flag Fields --
   -----------------------

   --  The following flag fields appear in expression nodes:

   --    Do_Division_Check
   --    Do_Overflow_Check
   --    Do_Range_Check

   --  These three flags are always set by the front end during semantic
   --  analysis, on expression nodes that may trigger the corresponding
   --  check. The front end then inserts or not the check during expansion. In
   --  particular, these flags should also be correctly set in GNATprove mode.
   --  As a special case, the front end does not insert a Do_Division_Check
   --  flag on float exponentiation expressions, for the case where the value
   --  is 0.0 and the exponent is negative, although this case does lead to a
   --  division check failure. As another special case, the front end does not
   --  insert a Do_Range_Check on an allocator where the designated type is
   --  scalar, and the designated type is more constrained than the type of the
   --  initialized allocator value or the type of the default value for an
   --  uninitialized allocator.

   --  Note that the expander always takes care of the Do_Range_Check case, so
   --  this flag will never be set in the expanded tree passed to the back end.
   --  For the other two flags, the check can be generated either by the back
   --  end or by the front end, depending on the setting of a target parameter.

   --  Note that this accounts for all nodes that trigger the corresponding
   --  checks, except for range checks on subtype_indications, which may be
   --  required to check that a range_constraint is compatible with the given
   --  subtype (RM 3.2.2(11)).

   --  The following flag fields appear in various nodes:

   --    Do_Discriminant_Check
   --    Do_Length_Check
   --    Do_Storage_Check

   --  These flags are used in some specific cases by the front end, either
   --  during semantic analysis or during expansion, and cannot be expected
   --  to be set on all nodes that trigger the corresponding check.

   ------------------------
   -- Common Flag Fields --
   ------------------------

   --  The following flag fields appear in all nodes:

   --  Analyzed
   --    This flag is used to indicate that a node (and all its children) have
   --    been analyzed. It is used to avoid reanalysis of a node that has
   --    already been analyzed, both for efficiency and functional correctness
   --    reasons.

   --  Comes_From_Source
   --    This flag is set if the node comes directly from an explicit construct
   --    in the source. It is normally on for any nodes built by the scanner or
   --    parser from the source program, with the exception that in a few cases
   --    the parser adds nodes to normalize the representation (in particular
   --    a null statement is added to a package body if there is no begin/end
   --    initialization section.
   --
   --    Most nodes inserted by the analyzer or expander are not considered
   --    as coming from source, so the flag is off for such nodes. In a few
   --    cases, the expander constructs nodes closely equivalent to nodes
   --    from the source program (e.g. the allocator built for build-in-place
   --    case), and the Comes_From_Source flag is deliberately set.

   --  Error_Posted
   --    This flag is used to avoid multiple error messages being posted on or
   --    referring to the same node. This flag is set if an error message
   --    refers to a node or is posted on its source location, and has the
   --    effect of inhibiting further messages involving this same node.

   -----------------------
   -- Modify_Tree_For_C --
   -----------------------

   --  If the flag Opt.Modify_Tree_For_C is set True, then the tree is modified
   --  in ways that help match the semantics better with C, easing the task of
   --  interfacing to C code generators (other than GCC, where the work is done
   --  in gigi, and there is no point in changing that), and also making life
   --  easier for Cprint in generating C source code.

   --  The current modifications implemented are as follows:

   --    N_Op_Rotate_Left, N_Op_Rotate_Right, N_Shift_Right_Arithmetic nodes
   --    are eliminated from the tree (since these operations do not exist in
   --    C), and the operations are rewritten in terms of logical shifts and
   --    other logical operations that do exist in C. See Exp_Ch4 expansion
   --    routines for these operators for details of the transformations made.

   --    The right operand of N_Op_Shift_Right and N_Op_Shift_Left is always
   --    less than the word size (since other values are not well-defined in
   --    C). This is done using an explicit test if necessary.

   --    Min and Max attributes are expanded into equivalent if expressions,
   --    dealing properly with side effect issues.

   --    Mod for signed integer types is expanded into equivalent expressions
   --    using Rem (which is % in C) and other C-available operators.

   --    Functions returning bounded arrays are transformed into procedures
   --    with an extra out parameter, and the calls updated accordingly.

   --    Aggregates are only kept unexpanded for object declarations, otherwise
   --    they are systematically expanded into loops (for arrays) and
   --    individual assignments (for records).

   --    Unconstrained array types are handled by means of fat pointers.

   --    Postconditions are inlined by the frontend since their body may have
   --    references to itypes defined in the enclosing subprogram.

   ------------------------------------
   -- Description of Semantic Fields --
   ------------------------------------

   --  The meaning of the syntactic fields is generally clear from their names
   --  without any further description, since the names are chosen to
   --  correspond very closely to the syntax in the reference manual. This
   --  section describes the usage of the semantic fields, which are used to
   --  contain additional information determined during semantic analysis.

   --  Accept_Handler_Records
   --    This field is present only in an N_Accept_Alternative node. It is used
   --    to temporarily hold the exception handler records from an accept
   --    statement in a selective accept. These exception handlers will
   --    eventually be placed in the Handler_Records list of the procedure
   --    built for this accept (see Expand_N_Selective_Accept procedure in
   --    Exp_Ch9 for further details).

   --  Access_Types_To_Process
   --    Present in N_Freeze_Entity nodes for Incomplete or private types.
   --    Contains the list of access types which may require specific treatment
   --    when the nature of the type completion is completely known. An example
   --    of such treatment is the generation of the associated_final_chain.

   --  Actions
   --    This field contains a sequence of actions that are associated with the
   --    node holding the field. See the individual node types for details of
   --    how this field is used, as well as the description of the specific use
   --    for a particular node type.

   --  Activation_Chain_Entity
   --    This is used in tree nodes representing task activators (blocks,
   --    subprogram bodies, package declarations, and task bodies). It is
   --    initially Empty, and then gets set to point to the entity for the
   --    declared Activation_Chain variable when the first task is declared.
   --    When tasks are declared in the corresponding declarative region this
   --    entity is located by name (its name is always _Chain) and the declared
   --    tasks are added to the chain. Note that N_Extended_Return_Statement
   --    does not have this attribute, although it does have an activation
   --    chain. This chain is used to store the tasks temporarily, and is not
   --    used for activating them. On successful completion of the return
   --    statement, the tasks are moved to the caller's chain, and the caller
   --    activates them.

   --  Acts_As_Spec
   --    A flag set in the N_Subprogram_Body node for a subprogram body which
   --    is acting as its own spec. In the case of a library-level subprogram
   --    the flag is set as well on the parent compilation unit node.

   --  Actual_Designated_Subtype
   --    Present in N_Free_Statement and N_Explicit_Dereference nodes. If gigi
   --    needs to know the dynamic constrained subtype of the designated
   --    object, this attribute is set to that subtype. This is done for
   --    N_Free_Statements for access-to-classwide types and access-to-
   --    unconstrained packed array types. For N_Explicit_Dereference,
   --    this is done in two circumstances: 1) when the designated type is
   --    an unconstrained packed array and the dereference is the prefix of
   --    a 'Size attribute reference, or 2) when the dereference node is
   --    created for the expansion of an allocator with a subtype_indication
   --    and the designated subtype is an unconstrained discriminated type.

   --  Address_Warning_Posted
   --    Present in N_Attribute_Definition nodes. Set to indicate that we have
   --    posted a warning for the address clause regarding size or alignment
   --    issues. Used to inhibit multiple redundant messages.

   --  Aggregate_Bounds
   --    Present in array N_Aggregate nodes. If the bounds of the aggregate are
   --    known at compile time, this field points to an N_Range node with those
   --    bounds. Otherwise Empty.

   --  Alloc_For_BIP_Return
   --    Present in N_Allocator nodes. True if the allocator is one of those
   --    generated for a build-in-place return statement.

   --  All_Others
   --    Present in an N_Others_Choice node. This flag is set for an others
   --    exception where all exceptions are to be caught, even those that are
   --    not normally handled (in particular the tasking abort signal). This
   --    is used for translation of the at end handler into a normal exception
   --    handler.

   --  Aspect_On_Partial_View
   --    Present on an N_Aspect_Specification node. For an aspect that applies
   --    to a type entity, indicates whether the specification appears on the
   --    partial view of a private type or extension. Undefined for aspects
   --    that apply to other entities.

   --  Aspect_Rep_Item
   --    Present in N_Aspect_Specification nodes. Points to the corresponding
   --    pragma/attribute definition node used to process the aspect.

   --  Assignment_OK
   --    This flag is set in a subexpression node for an object, indicating
   --    that the associated object can be modified, even if this would not
   --    normally be permissible (either by direct assignment, or by being
   --    passed as an out or in-out parameter). This is used by the expander
   --    for a number of purposes, including initialization of constants and
   --    limited type objects (such as tasks), setting discriminant fields,
   --    setting tag values, etc. N_Object_Declaration nodes also have this
   --    flag defined. Here it is used to indicate that an initialization
   --    expression is valid, even where it would normally not be allowed
   --    (e.g. where the type involved is limited). It is also used to stop
   --    a Force_Evaluation call for an unchecked conversion, but this usage
   --    is unclear and not documented ???

   --  Associated_Node
   --    Present in nodes that can denote an entity: identifiers, character
   --    literals, operator symbols, expanded names, operator nodes, and
   --    attribute reference nodes (all these nodes have an Entity field).
   --    This field is also present in N_Aggregate, N_Selected_Component, and
   --    N_Extension_Aggregate nodes. This field is used in generic processing
   --    to create links between the generic template and the generic copy.
   --    See Sem_Ch12.Get_Associated_Node for full details. Note that this
   --    field overlaps Entity, which is fine, since, as explained in Sem_Ch12,
   --    the normal function of Entity is not required at the point where the
   --    Associated_Node is set. Note also, that in generic templates, this
   --    means that the Entity field does not necessarily point to an Entity.
   --    Since the back end is expected to ignore generic templates, this is
   --    harmless.

   --  Atomic_Sync_Required
   --    This flag is set on a node for which atomic synchronization is
   --    required for the corresponding reference or modification.

   --  At_End_Proc
   --    This field is present in an N_Handled_Sequence_Of_Statements node.
   --    It contains an identifier reference for the cleanup procedure to be
   --    called. See description of this node for further details.

   --  Backwards_OK
   --    A flag present in the N_Assignment_Statement node. It is used only
   --    if the type being assigned is an array type, and is set if analysis
   --    determines that it is definitely safe to do the copy backwards, i.e.
   --    starting at the highest addressed element. This is the case if either
   --    the operands do not overlap, or they may overlap, but if they do,
   --    then the left operand is at a higher address than the right operand.
   --
   --    Note: If neither of the flags Forwards_OK or Backwards_OK is set, it
   --    means that the front end could not determine that either direction is
   --    definitely safe, and a runtime check may be required if the backend
   --    cannot figure it out. If both flags Forwards_OK and Backwards_OK are
   --    set, it means that the front end can assure no overlap of operands.

   --  Body_To_Inline
   --    Present in subprogram declarations. Denotes analyzed but unexpanded
   --    body of subprogram, to be used when inlining calls. Present when the
   --    subprogram has an Inline pragma and inlining is enabled. If the
   --    declaration is completed by a renaming_as_body, and the renamed entity
   --    is a subprogram, the Body_To_Inline is the name of that entity, which
   --    is used directly in later calls to the original subprogram.

   --  Body_Required
   --    A flag that appears in the N_Compilation_Unit node indicating that
   --    the corresponding unit requires a body. For the package case, this
   --    indicates that a completion is required. In Ada 95, if the flag is not
   --    set for the package case, then a body may not be present. In Ada 83,
   --    if the flag is not set for the package case, then body is optional.
   --    For a subprogram declaration, the flag is set except in the case where
   --    a pragma Import or Interface applies, in which case no body is
   --    permitted (in Ada 83 or Ada 95).

   --  Cleanup_Actions
   --    Present in block statements created for transient blocks, contains
   --    additional cleanup actions carried over from the transient scope.

   --  Check_Address_Alignment
   --    A flag present in N_Attribute_Definition clause for a 'Address
   --    attribute definition. This flag is set if a dynamic check should be
   --    generated at the freeze point for the entity to which this address
   --    clause applies. The reason that we need this flag is that we want to
   --    check for range checks being suppressed at the point where the
   --    attribute definition clause is given, rather than testing this at the
   --    freeze point.

   --  Comes_From_Extended_Return_Statement
   --    Present in N_Simple_Return_Statement nodes. True if this node was
   --    constructed as part of the N_Extended_Return_Statement expansion.

   --  Compile_Time_Known_Aggregate
   --    Present in N_Aggregate nodes. Set for aggregates which can be fully
   --    evaluated at compile time without raising constraint error. Such
   --    aggregates can be passed as is to the back end without any expansion.
   --    See Exp_Aggr for specific conditions under which this flag gets set.

   --  Componentwise_Assignment
   --    Present in N_Assignment_Statement nodes. Set for a record assignment
   --    where all that needs doing is to expand it into component-by-component
   --    assignments. This is used internally for the case of tagged types with
   --    rep clauses, where we need to avoid recursion (we don't want to try to
   --    generate a call to the primitive operation, because this is the case
   --    where we are compiling the primitive operation). Note that when we are
   --    expanding component assignments in this case, we never assign the _tag
   --    field, but we recursively assign components of the parent type.

   --  Condition_Actions
   --    This field appears in else-if nodes and in the iteration scheme node
   --    for while loops. This field is only used during semantic processing to
   --    temporarily hold actions inserted into the tree. In the tree passed
   --    to gigi, the condition actions field is always set to No_List. For
   --    details on how this field is used, see the routine Insert_Actions in
   --    package Exp_Util, and also the expansion routines for the relevant
   --    nodes.

   --  Context_Pending
   --    This field appears in Compilation_Unit nodes, to indicate that the
   --    context of the unit is being compiled. Used to detect circularities
   --    that are not otherwise detected by the loading mechanism. Such
   --    circularities can occur in the presence of limited and non-limited
   --    with_clauses that mention the same units.

   --  Controlling_Argument
   --    This field is set in procedure and function call nodes if the call
   --    is a dispatching call (it is Empty for a non-dispatching call). It
   --    indicates the source of the call's controlling tag. For procedure
   --    calls, the Controlling_Argument is one of the actuals. For function
   --    that has a dispatching result, it is an entity in the context of the
   --    call that can provide a tag, or else it is the tag of the root type
   --    of the class. It can also specify a tag directly rather than being a
   --    tagged object. The latter is needed by the implementations of AI-239
   --    and AI-260.

   --  Conversion_OK
   --    A flag set on type conversion nodes to indicate that the conversion
   --    is to be considered as being valid, even though it is the case that
   --    the conversion is not valid Ada. This is used for attributes Enum_Rep,
   --    Pos, Val, Fixed_Value and Integer_Value, for internal conversions done
   --    for fixed-point operations, and for certain conversions for calls to
   --    initialization procedures. If Conversion_OK is set, then Etype must be
   --    set (the analyzer assumes that Etype has been set). For the case of
   --    fixed-point operands, it also indicates that the conversion is to be
   --    direct conversion of the underlying integer result, with no regard to
   --    the small operand.

   --  Corresponding_Aspect
   --    Present in N_Pragma node. Used to point back to the source aspect from
   --    the corresponding pragma. This field is Empty for source pragmas.

   --  Corresponding_Body
   --    This field is set in subprogram declarations, package declarations,
   --    entry declarations of protected types, and in generic units. It points
   --    to the defining entity for the corresponding body (NOT the node for
   --    the body itself).

   --    Corresponding_Entry_Body
   --    Defined in N_Subprogram_Body. Set for subprogram bodies that implement
   --    a protected type entry; points to the body for the entry.

   --  Corresponding_Formal_Spec
   --    This field is set in subprogram renaming declarations, where it points
   --    to the defining entity for a formal subprogram in the case where the
   --    renaming corresponds to a generic formal subprogram association in an
   --    instantiation. The field is Empty if the renaming does not correspond
   --    to such a formal association.

   --  Corresponding_Generic_Association
   --    This field is defined for object declarations and object renaming
   --    declarations. It is set for the declarations within an instance that
   --    map generic formals to their actuals. If set, the field points either
   --    to a copy of a default expression for an actual of mode IN or to a
   --    generic_association which is the original parent of the expression or
   --    name appearing in the declaration. This simplifies GNATprove queries.

   --  Corresponding_Integer_Value
   --    This field is set in real literals of fixed-point types (it is not
   --    used for floating-point types). It contains the integer value used
   --    to represent the fixed-point value. It is also set on the universal
   --    real literals used to represent bounds of fixed-point base types
   --    and their first named subtypes.

   --  Corresponding_Spec
   --    This field is set in subprogram, package, task, and protected body
   --    nodes, where it points to the defining entity in the corresponding
   --    spec. The attribute is also set in N_With_Clause nodes where it points
   --    to the defining entity for the with'ed spec, and in a subprogram
   --    renaming declaration when it is a Renaming_As_Body. The field is Empty
   --    if there is no corresponding spec, as in the case of a subprogram body
   --    that serves as its own spec.
   --
   --    In Ada 2012, Corresponding_Spec is set on expression functions that
   --    complete a subprogram declaration.

   --  Corresponding_Spec_Of_Stub
   --    This field is present in subprogram, package, task, and protected body
   --    stubs where it points to the corresponding spec of the stub. Due to
   --    clashes in the structure of nodes, we cannot use Corresponding_Spec.

   --  Corresponding_Stub
   --    This field is present in an N_Subunit node. It holds the node in
   --    the parent unit that is the stub declaration for the subunit. It is
   --    set when analysis of the stub forces loading of the proper body. If
   --    expansion of the proper body creates new declarative nodes, they are
   --    inserted at the point of the corresponding_stub.

   --  Dcheck_Function
   --    This field is present in an N_Variant node, It references the entity
   --    for the discriminant checking function for the variant.

   --  Default_Expression
   --    This field is Empty if there is no default expression. If there is a
   --    simple default expression (one with no side effects), then this field
   --    simply contains a copy of the Expression field (both point to the tree
   --    for the default expression). Default_Expression is used for
   --    conformance checking.

   --  Default_Storage_Pool
   --    This field is present in N_Compilation_Unit_Aux nodes. It is set to a
   --    copy of Opt.Default_Pool at the end of the compilation unit. See
   --    package Opt for details. This is used for inheriting the
   --    Default_Storage_Pool in child units.

   --  Discr_Check_Funcs_Built
   --    This flag is present in N_Full_Type_Declaration nodes. It is set when
   --    discriminant checking functions are constructed. The purpose is to
   --    avoid attempting to set these functions more than once.

   --  Do_Discriminant_Check
   --    This flag is set on N_Selected_Component nodes to indicate that a
   --    discriminant check is required using the discriminant check routine
   --    associated with the selector. The actual check is generated by the
   --    expander when processing selected components. In the case of
   --    Unchecked_Union, the flag is also set, but no discriminant check
   --    routine is associated with the selector, and the expander does not
   --    generate a check. This flag is also present in assignment statements
   --    (and set if the assignment requires a discriminant check), and in type
   --    conversion nodes (and set if the conversion requires a check).

   --  Do_Division_Check
   --    This flag is set on a division operator (/ mod rem) to indicate that
   --    a zero divide check is required. The actual check is either dealt with
   --    by the back end if Backend_Divide_Checks is set to true, or by the
   --    front end itself if it is set to false.

   --  Do_Length_Check
   --    This flag is set in an N_Assignment_Statement, N_Op_And, N_Op_Or,
   --    N_Op_Xor, or N_Type_Conversion node to indicate that a length check
   --    is required. It is not determined who deals with this flag (???).

   --  Do_Overflow_Check
   --    This flag is set on an operator where an overflow check is required on
   --    the operation. The actual check is either dealt with by the back end
   --    if Backend_Overflow_Checks is set to true, or by the front end itself
   --    if it is set to false. The other cases where this flag is used is on a
   --    Type_Conversion node as well on if and case expression nodes.
   --    For a type conversion, it means that the conversion is from one base
   --    type to another, and the value may not fit in the target base type.
   --    See also the description of Do_Range_Check for this case. This flag is
   --    also set on if and case expression nodes if we are operating in either
   --    MINIMIZED or ELIMINATED overflow checking mode (to make sure that we
   --    properly process overflow checking for dependent expressions).

   --  Do_Range_Check
   --    This flag is set on an expression which appears in a context where a
   --    range check is required. The target type is clear from the context.
   --    The contexts in which this flag can appear are the following:

   --      Right side of an assignment. In this case the target type is taken
   --      from the left side of the assignment, which is referenced by the
   --      Name of the N_Assignment_Statement node.

   --      Subscript expressions in an indexed component. In this case the
   --      target type is determined from the type of the array, which is
   --      referenced by the Prefix of the N_Indexed_Component node.

   --      Argument expression for a parameter, appearing either directly in
   --      the Parameter_Associations list of a call or as the Expression of an
   --      N_Parameter_Association node that appears in this list. In either
   --      case, the check is against the type of the formal. Note that the
   --      flag is relevant only in IN and IN OUT parameters, and will be
   --      ignored for OUT parameters, where no check is required in the call,
   --      and if a check is required on the return, it is generated explicitly
   --      with a type conversion.

   --      Initialization expression for the initial value in an object
   --      declaration. In this case the Do_Range_Check flag is set on
   --      the initialization expression, and the check is against the
   --      range of the type of the object being declared. This includes the
   --      cases of expressions providing default discriminant values, and
   --      expressions used to initialize record components.

   --      The expression of a type conversion. In this case the range check is
   --      against the target type of the conversion. See also the use of
   --      Do_Overflow_Check on a type conversion. The distinction is that the
   --      overflow check protects against a value that is outside the range of
   --      the target base type, whereas a range check checks that the
   --      resulting value (which is a value of the base type of the target
   --      type), satisfies the range constraint of the target type.

   --    Note: when a range check is required in contexts other than those
   --    listed above (e.g. in a return statement), an additional type
   --    conversion node is introduced to represent the required check.

   --  Do_Storage_Check
   --    This flag is set in an N_Allocator node to indicate that a storage
   --    check is required for the allocation, or in an N_Subprogram_Body node
   --    to indicate that a stack check is required in the subprogram prologue.
   --    The N_Allocator case is handled by the routine that expands the call
   --    to the runtime routine. The N_Subprogram_Body case is handled by the
   --    backend, and all the semantics does is set the flag.

   --  Elaborate_Present
   --    This flag is set in the N_With_Clause node to indicate that pragma
   --    Elaborate pragma appears for the with'ed units.

   --  Elaborate_All_Desirable
   --    This flag is set in the N_With_Clause mode to indicate that the static
   --    elaboration processing has determined that an Elaborate_All pragma is
   --    desirable for correct elaboration for this unit.

   --  Elaborate_All_Present
   --    This flag is set in the N_With_Clause node to indicate that a
   --    pragma Elaborate_All pragma appears for the with'ed units.

   --  Elaborate_Desirable
   --    This flag is set in the N_With_Clause mode to indicate that the static
   --    elaboration processing has determined that an Elaborate pragma is
   --    desirable for correct elaboration for this unit.

   --  Else_Actions
   --    This field is present in if expression nodes. During code
   --    expansion we use the Insert_Actions procedure (in Exp_Util) to insert
   --    actions at an appropriate place in the tree to get elaborated at the
   --    right time. For if expressions, we have to be sure that the actions
   --    for the Else branch are only elaborated if the condition is False.
   --    The Else_Actions field is used as a temporary parking place for
   --    these actions. The final tree is always rewritten to eliminate the
   --    need for this field, so in the tree passed to Gigi, this field is
   --    always set to No_List.

   --  Enclosing_Variant
   --    This field is present in the N_Variant node and identifies the Node_Id
   --    corresponding to the immediately enclosing variant when the variant is
   --    nested, and N_Empty otherwise. Set during semantic processing of the
   --    variant part of a record type.

   --  Entity
   --    Appears in all direct names (identifiers, character literals, and
   --    operator symbols), as well as expanded names, and attributes that
   --    denote entities, such as 'Class. Points to entity for corresponding
   --    defining occurrence. Set after name resolution. For identifiers in a
   --    WITH list, the corresponding defining occurrence is in a separately
   --    compiled file, and Entity must be set by the library Load procedure.
   --
   --    Note: During name resolution, the value in Entity may be temporarily
   --    incorrect (e.g. during overload resolution, Entity is initially set to
   --    the first possible correct interpretation, and then later modified if
   --    necessary to contain the correct value after resolution).
   --
   --    Note: This field overlaps Associated_Node, which is used during
   --    generic processing (see Sem_Ch12 for details). Note also that in
   --    generic templates, this means that the Entity field does not always
   --    point to an Entity. Since the back end is expected to ignore generic
   --    templates, this is harmless.
   --
   --    Note: This field also appears in N_Attribute_Definition_Clause nodes.
   --    It is used only for stream attributes definition clauses. In this
   --    case, it denotes a (possibly dummy) subprogram entity that is declared
   --    conceptually at the point of the clause. Thus the visibility of the
   --    attribute definition clause (in the sense of 8.3(23) as amended by
   --    AI-195) can be checked by testing the visibility of that subprogram.
   --
   --    Note: Normally the Entity field of an identifier points to the entity
   --    for the corresponding defining identifier, and hence the Chars field
   --    of an identifier will match the Chars field of the entity. However,
   --    there is no requirement that these match, and there are obscure cases
   --    of generated code where they do not match.

   --    Note: Ada 2012 aspect specifications require additional links between
   --    identifiers and various attributes. These attributes can be of
   --    arbitrary types, and the entity field of identifiers that denote
   --    aspects must be used to store arbitrary expressions for later semantic
   --    checks. See section on aspect specifications for details.

   --  Entity_Or_Associated_Node
   --    A synonym for both Entity and Associated_Node. Used by convention in
   --    the code when referencing this field in cases where it is not known
   --    whether the field contains an Entity or an Associated_Node.

   --  Etype
   --    Appears in all expression nodes, all direct names, and all entities.
   --    Points to the entity for the related type. Set after type resolution.
   --    Normally this is the actual subtype of the expression. However, in
   --    certain contexts such as the right side of an assignment, subscripts,
   --    arguments to calls, returned value in a function, initial value etc.
   --    it is the desired target type. In the event that this is different
   --    from the actual type, the Do_Range_Check flag will be set if a range
   --    check is required. Note: if the Is_Overloaded flag is set, then Etype
   --    points to an essentially arbitrary choice from the possible set of
   --    types.

   --  Exception_Junk
   --    This flag is set in a various nodes appearing in a statement sequence
   --    to indicate that the corresponding node is an artifact of the
   --    generated code for exception handling, and should be ignored when
   --    analyzing the control flow of the relevant sequence of statements
   --    (e.g. to check that it does not end with a bad return statement).

   --  Exception_Label
   --    Appears in N_Push_xxx_Label nodes. Points to the entity of the label
   --    to be used for transforming the corresponding exception into a goto,
   --    or contains Empty, if this exception is not to be transformed. Also
   --    appears in N_Exception_Handler nodes, where, if set, it indicates
   --    that there may be a local raise for the handler, so that expansion
   --    to allow a goto is required (and this field contains the label for
   --    this goto). See Exp_Ch11.Expand_Local_Exception_Handlers for details.

   --  Expansion_Delayed
   --    Set on aggregates and extension aggregates that need a top-down rather
   --    than bottom-up expansion. Typically aggregate expansion happens bottom
   --    up. For nested aggregates the expansion is delayed until the enclosing
   --    aggregate itself is expanded, e.g. in the context of a declaration. To
   --    delay it we set this flag. This is done to avoid creating a temporary
   --    for each level of a nested aggregate, and also to prevent the
   --    premature generation of constraint checks. This is also a requirement
   --    if we want to generate the proper attachment to the internal
   --    finalization lists (for record with controlled components). Top down
   --    expansion of aggregates is also used for in-place array aggregate
   --    assignment or initialization. When the full context is known, the
   --    target of the assignment or initialization is used to generate the
   --    left-hand side of individual assignment to each subcomponent.

   --  Expression_Copy
   --    Present in N_Pragma_Argument_Association nodes. Contains a copy of the
   --    original expression. This field is best used to store pragma-dependent
   --    modifications performed on the original expression such as replacement
   --    of the current type instance or substitutions of primitives.

   --  First_Inlined_Subprogram
   --    Present in the N_Compilation_Unit node for the main program. Points
   --    to a chain of entities for subprograms that are to be inlined. The
   --    Next_Inlined_Subprogram field of these entities is used as a link
   --    pointer with Empty marking the end of the list. This field is Empty
   --    if there are no inlined subprograms or inlining is not active.

   --  First_Named_Actual
   --    Present in procedure call statement and function call nodes, and also
   --    in Intrinsic nodes. Set during semantic analysis to point to the first
   --    named parameter where parameters are ordered by declaration order (as
   --    opposed to the actual order in the call which may be different due to
   --    named associations). Note: this field points to the explicit actual
   --    parameter itself, not the N_Parameter_Association node (its parent).

   --  First_Real_Statement
   --    Present in N_Handled_Sequence_Of_Statements node. Normally set to
   --    Empty. Used only when declarations are moved into the statement part
   --    of a construct as a result of wrapping an AT END handler that is
   --    required to cover the declarations. In this case, this field is used
   --    to remember the location in the statements list of the first real
   --    statement, i.e. the statement that used to be first in the statement
   --    list before the declarations were prepended.

   --  First_Subtype_Link
   --    Present in N_Freeze_Entity node for an anonymous base type that is
   --    implicitly created by the declaration of a first subtype. It points
   --    to the entity for the first subtype.

   --  Float_Truncate
   --    A flag present in type conversion nodes. This is used for float to
   --    integer conversions where truncation is required rather than rounding.

   --  Forwards_OK
   --    A flag present in the N_Assignment_Statement node. It is used only
   --    if the type being assigned is an array type, and is set if analysis
   --    determines that it is definitely safe to do the copy forwards, i.e.
   --    starting at the lowest addressed element. This is the case if either
   --    the operands do not overlap, or they may overlap, but if they do,
   --    then the left operand is at a lower address than the right operand.
   --
   --    Note: If neither of the flags Forwards_OK or Backwards_OK is set, it
   --    means that the front end could not determine that either direction is
   --    definitely safe, and a runtime check may be required if the backend
   --    cannot figure it out. If both flags Forwards_OK and Backwards_OK are
   --    set, it means that the front end can assure no overlap of operands.

   --  From_Aspect_Specification
   --    Processing of aspect specifications typically results in insertion in
   --    the tree of corresponding pragma or attribute definition clause nodes.
   --    These generated nodes have the From_Aspect_Specification flag set to
   --    indicate that they came from aspect specifications originally.

   --  From_At_Mod
   --    This flag is set on the attribute definition clause node that is
   --    generated by a transformation of an at mod phrase in a record
   --    representation clause. This is used to give slightly different (Ada 83
   --    compatible) semantics to such a clause, namely it is used to specify a
   --    minimum acceptable alignment for the base type and all subtypes. In
   --    Ada 95 terms, the actual alignment of the base type and all subtypes
   --    must be a multiple of the given value, and the representation clause
   --    is considered to be type specific instead of subtype specific.

   --  From_Conditional_Expression
   --    This flag is set on if and case statements generated by the expansion
   --    of if and case expressions respectively. The flag is used to suppress
   --    any finalization of controlled objects found within these statements.

   --  From_Default
   --    This flag is set on the subprogram renaming declaration created in an
   --    instance for a formal subprogram, when the formal is declared with a
   --    box, and there is no explicit actual. If the flag is present, the
   --    declaration is treated as an implicit reference to the formal in the
   --    ali file.

   --  Generalized_Indexing
   --    Present in N_Indexed_Component nodes. Set for Indexed_Component nodes
   --    that are Ada 2012 container indexing operations. The value of the
   --    attribute is a function call (possibly dereferenced) that corresponds
   --    to the proper expansion of the source indexing operation. Before
   --    expansion, the source node is rewritten as the resolved generalized
   --    indexing.

   --  Generic_Parent
   --    Generic_Parent is defined on declaration nodes that are instances. The
   --    value of Generic_Parent is the generic entity from which the instance
   --    is obtained.

   --  Generic_Parent_Type
   --    Generic_Parent_Type is defined on Subtype_Declaration nodes for the
   --    actuals of formal private and derived types. Within the instance, the
   --    operations on the actual are those inherited from the parent. For a
   --    formal private type, the parent type is the generic type itself. The
   --    Generic_Parent_Type is also used in an instance to determine whether a
   --    private operation overrides an inherited one.

   --  Handler_List_Entry
   --    This field is present in N_Object_Declaration nodes. It is set only
   --    for the Handler_Record entry generated for an exception in zero cost
   --    exception handling mode. It references the corresponding item in the
   --    handler list, and is used to delete this entry if the corresponding
   --    handler is deleted during optimization. For further details on why
   --    this is required, see Exp_Ch11.Remove_Handler_Entries.

   --  Has_Dereference_Action
   --    This flag is present in N_Explicit_Dereference nodes. It is set to
   --    indicate that the expansion has aready produced a call to primitive
   --    Dereference of a System.Checked_Pools.Checked_Pool implementation.
   --    Such dereference actions are produced for debugging purposes.

   --  Has_Dynamic_Length_Check
   --    This flag is present in all expression nodes. It is set to indicate
   --    that one of the routines in unit Checks has generated a length check
   --    action which has been inserted at the flagged node. This is used to
   --    avoid the generation of duplicate checks.

   --  Has_Local_Raise
   --    Present in exception handler nodes. Set if the handler can be entered
   --    via a local raise that gets transformed to a goto statement. This will
   --    always be set if Local_Raise_Statements is non-empty, but can also be
   --    set as a result of generation of N_Raise_xxx nodes, or flags set in
   --    nodes requiring generation of back end checks.

   --  Has_No_Elaboration_Code
   --    A flag that appears in the N_Compilation_Unit node to indicate whether
   --    or not elaboration code is present for this unit. It is initially set
   --    true for subprogram specs and bodies and for all generic units and
   --    false for non-generic package specs and bodies. Gigi may set the flag
   --    in the non-generic package case if it determines that no elaboration
   --    code is generated. Note that this flag is not related to the
   --    Is_Preelaborated status, there can be preelaborated packages that
   --    generate elaboration code, and non-preelaborated packages which do
   --    not generate elaboration code.

   --  Has_Pragma_Suppress_All
   --    This flag is set in an N_Compilation_Unit node if the Suppress_All
   --    pragma appears anywhere in the unit. This accommodates the rather
   --    strange placement rules of other compilers (DEC permits it at the
   --    end of a unit, and Rational allows it as a program unit pragma). We
   --    allow it anywhere at all, and consider it equivalent to a pragma
   --    Suppress (All_Checks) appearing at the start of the configuration
   --    pragmas for the unit.

   --  Has_Private_View
   --    A flag present in generic nodes that have an entity, to indicate that
   --    the node has a private type. Used to exchange private and full
   --    declarations if the visibility at instantiation is different from the
   --    visibility at generic definition.

   --  Has_Relative_Deadline_Pragma
   --    A flag present in N_Subprogram_Body and N_Task_Definition nodes to
   --    flag the presence of a pragma Relative_Deadline.

   --  Has_Self_Reference
   --    Present in N_Aggregate and N_Extension_Aggregate. Indicates that one
   --    of the expressions contains an access attribute reference to the
   --    enclosing type. Such a self-reference can only appear in default-
   --    initialized aggregate for a record type.

   --  Has_SP_Choice
   --    Present in all nodes containing a Discrete_Choices field (N_Variant,
   --    N_Case_Expression_Alternative, N_Case_Statement_Alternative). Set to
   --    True if the Discrete_Choices list has at least one occurrence of a
   --    statically predicated subtype.

   --  Has_Storage_Size_Pragma
   --    A flag present in an N_Task_Definition node to flag the presence of a
   --    Storage_Size pragma.

   --  Has_Target_Names
   --    Present in assignment statements. Indicates that the RHS contains
   --    target names (see AI12-0125-3) and must be expanded accordingly.

   --  Has_Wide_Character
   --    Present in string literals, set if any wide character (i.e. character
   --    code outside the Character range but within Wide_Character range)
   --    appears in the string. Used to implement pragma preference rules.

   --  Has_Wide_Wide_Character
   --    Present in string literals, set if any wide character (i.e. character
   --    code outside the Wide_Character range) appears in the string. Used to
   --    implement pragma preference rules.

   --  Header_Size_Added
   --    Present in N_Attribute_Reference nodes, set only for attribute
   --    Max_Size_In_Storage_Elements. The flag indicates that the size of the
   --    hidden list header used by the runtime finalization support has been
   --    added to the size of the prefix. The flag also prevents the infinite
   --    expansion of the same attribute in the said context.

   --  Hidden_By_Use_Clause
   --    An entity list present in use clauses that appear within
   --    instantiations. For the resolution of local entities, entities
   --    introduced by these use clauses have priority over global ones,
   --    and outer entities must be explicitly hidden/restored on exit.

   --  Implicit_With
   --    Present in N_With_Clause nodes. The flag indicates that the clause
   --    does not comes from source and introduces an implicit dependency on
   --    a particular unit. Such implicit with clauses are generated by:
   --
   --      * ABE mechanism - The static elaboration model of both the default
   --        and the legacy ABE mechanism use with clauses to encode implicit
   --        Elaborate[_All] pragmas.
   --
   --      * Analysis - A with clause for child unit A.B.C is equivalent to
   --        a series of clauses that with A, A.B, and A.B.C. Manipulation of
   --        contexts utilizes implicit with clauses to emulate the visibility
   --        of a particular unit.
   --
   --      * RTSfind - The compiler generates code which references entities
   --        from the runtime.

   --  Import_Interface_Present
   --    This flag is set in an Interface or Import pragma if a matching
   --    pragma of the other kind is also present. This is used to avoid
   --    generating some unwanted error messages.

   --  Includes_Infinities
   --    This flag is present in N_Range nodes. It is set for the range of
   --    unconstrained float types defined in Standard, which include not only
   --    the given range of values, but also legitimately can include infinite
   --    values. This flag is false for any float type for which an explicit
   --    range is given by the programmer, even if that range is identical to
   --    the range for Float.

   --  Incomplete_View
   --    Present in full type declarations that are completions of incomplete
   --    type declarations. Denotes the corresponding incomplete view declared
   --    by the incomplete declaration.

   --  Inherited_Discriminant
   --    This flag is present in N_Component_Association nodes. It indicates
   --    that a given component association in an extension aggregate is the
   --    value obtained from a constraint on an ancestor. Used to prevent
   --    double expansion when the aggregate has expansion delayed.

   --  Instance_Spec
   --    This field is present in generic instantiation nodes, and also in
   --    formal package declaration nodes (formal package declarations are
   --    treated in a manner very similar to package instantiations). It points
   --    to the node for the spec of the instance, inserted as part of the
   --    semantic processing for instantiations in Sem_Ch12.

   --  Is_Abort_Block
   --    Present in N_Block_Statement nodes. True if the block protects a list
   --    of statements with an Abort_Defer / Abort_Undefer_Direct pair.

   --  Is_Accessibility_Actual
   --    Present in N_Parameter_Association nodes. True if the parameter is
   --    an extra actual that carries the accessibility level of the actual
   --    for an access parameter, in a function that dispatches on result and
   --    is called in a dispatching context. Used to prevent a formal/actual
   --    mismatch when the call is rewritten as a dispatching call.

   --  Is_Analyzed_Pragma
   --    Present in N_Pragma nodes. Set for delayed pragmas that require a two
   --    step analysis. The initial step is peformed by routine Analyze_Pragma
   --    and verifies the overall legality of the pragma. The second step takes
   --    place in the various Analyze_xxx_In_Decl_Part routines which perform
   --    full analysis. The flag prevents the reanalysis of a delayed pragma.

   --  Is_Asynchronous_Call_Block
   --    A flag set in a Block_Statement node to indicate that it is the
   --    expansion of an asynchronous entry call. Such a block needs cleanup
   --    handler to assure that the call is cancelled.

   --  Is_Boolean_Aspect
   --    Present in N_Aspect_Specification node. Set if the aspect is for a
   --    boolean aspect (i.e. Aspect_Id is in Boolean_Aspect subtype).

   --  Is_Checked
   --    Present in N_Aspect_Specification and N_Pragma nodes. Set for an
   --    assertion aspect or pragma, or check pragma for an assertion, that
   --    is to be checked at run time. If either Is_Checked or Is_Ignored
   --    is set (they cannot both be set), then this means that the status of
   --    the pragma has been checked at the appropriate point and should not
   --    be further modified (in some cases these flags are copied when a
   --    pragma is rewritten).

   --  Is_Checked_Ghost_Pragma
   --    This flag is present in N_Pragma nodes. It is set when the pragma is
   --    related to a checked Ghost entity or encloses a checked Ghost entity.
   --    This flag has no relation to Is_Checked.

   --  Is_Component_Left_Opnd
   --  Is_Component_Right_Opnd
   --    Present in concatenation nodes, to indicate that the corresponding
   --    operand is of the component type of the result. Used in resolving
   --    concatenation nodes in instances.

   --  Is_Controlling_Actual
   --    This flag is set on an expression that is a controlling argument in
   --    a dispatching call. It is off in all other cases. See Sem_Disp for
   --    details of its use.

   --  Is_Declaration_Level_Node
   --    Present in call marker and instantiation nodes. Set when the constuct
   --    appears within the declarations of a block statement, an entry body,
   --    a subprogram body, or a task body. The flag aids the ABE Processing
   --    phase to catch certain forms of guaranteed ABEs.

   --  Is_Delayed_Aspect
   --    Present in N_Pragma and N_Attribute_Definition_Clause nodes which
   --    come from aspect specifications, where the evaluation of the aspect
   --    must be delayed to the freeze point. This flag is also set True in
   --    the corresponding N_Aspect_Specification node.

   --  Is_Disabled
   --    A flag set in an N_Aspect_Specification or N_Pragma node if there was
   --    a Check_Policy or Assertion_Policy (or in the case of a Debug_Pragma)
   --    a Debug_Policy pragma that resulted in totally disabling the flagged
   --    aspect or policy as a result of using the GNAT-defined policy DISABLE.
   --    If this flag is set, the aspect or policy is not analyzed for semantic
   --    correctness, so any expressions etc will not be marked as analyzed.

   --  Is_Dispatching_Call
   --    Present in call marker nodes. Set when the related call which prompted
   --    the creation of the marker is dispatching.

   --  Is_Dynamic_Coextension
   --    Present in allocator nodes, to indicate that this is an allocator
   --    for an access discriminant of a dynamically allocated object. The
   --    coextension must be deallocated and finalized at the same time as
   --    the enclosing object. The partner flag Is_Static_Coextension must
   --    be cleared before setting this flag to True.

   --  Is_Effective_Use_Clause
   --    Present in both N_Use_Type_Clause and N_Use_Package_Clause to indicate
   --    a use clause is "used" in the current source.

   --  Is_Elaboration_Checks_OK_Node
   --    Present in the following nodes:
   --
   --      assignment statement
   --      attribute reference
   --      call marker
   --      entry call statement
   --      expanded name
   --      function call
   --      function instantiation
   --      identifier
   --      package instantiation
   --      procedure call statement
   --      procedure instantiation
   --      requeue statement
   --      variable reference marker
   --
   --    Set when the node appears within a context which allows the generation
   --    of run-time ABE checks. This flag detemines whether the ABE Processing
   --    phase generates conditional ABE checks and guaranteed ABE failures.

   --  Is_Elaboration_Code
   --    Present in assignment statements. Set for an assignment which updates
   --    the elaboration flag of a package or subprogram when the corresponding
   --    body is successfully elaborated.

   --  Is_Elaboration_Warnings_OK_Node
   --    Present in the following nodes:
   --
   --      attribute reference
   --      call marker
   --      entry call statement
   --      expanded name
   --      function call
   --      function instantiation
   --      identifier
   --      package instantiation
   --      procedure call statement
   --      procedure instantiation
   --      requeue statement
   --      variable reference marker
   --
   --    Set when the node appears within a context where elaboration warnings
   --    are enabled. This flag determines whether the ABE processing phase
   --    generates diagnostics on various elaboration issues.

   --  Is_Entry_Barrier_Function
   --    This flag is set on N_Subprogram_Declaration and N_Subprogram_Body
   --    nodes which emulate the barrier function of a protected entry body.
   --    The flag is used when checking for incorrect use of Current_Task.

   --  Is_Enum_Array_Aggregate
   --    A flag set on an aggregate created internally while building the
   --    images tables for enumerations.

   --  Is_Expanded_Build_In_Place_Call
   --    This flag is set in an N_Function_Call node to indicate that the extra
   --    actuals to support a build-in-place style of call have been added to
   --    the call.

   --  Is_Expanded_Contract
   --    Present in N_Contract nodes. Set if the contract has already undergone
   --    expansion activities.

   --  Is_Finalization_Wrapper
   --    This flag is present in N_Block_Statement nodes. It is set when the
   --    block acts as a wrapper of a handled construct which has controlled
   --    objects. The wrapper prevents interference between exception handlers
   --    and At_End handlers.

   --  Is_Generic_Contract_Pragma
   --    This flag is present in N_Pragma nodes. It is set when the pragma is
   --    a source construct, applies to a generic unit or its body, and denotes
   --    one of the following contract-related annotations:
   --      Abstract_State
   --      Contract_Cases
   --      Depends
   --      Extensions_Visible
   --      Global
   --      Initial_Condition
   --      Initializes
   --      Post
   --      Post_Class
   --      Postcondition
   --      Pre
   --      Pre_Class
   --      Precondition
   --      Refined_Depends
   --      Refined_Global
   --      Refined_Post
   --      Refined_State
   --      Test_Case

   --  Is_Homogeneous_Aggregate
   --    A flag set on an Ada 2022 aggregate that uses square brackets as
   --    delimiters, and thus denotes an array or container aggregate, or
   --    the prefix of a reduction attribute.

   --  Is_Ignored
   --    A flag set in an N_Aspect_Specification or N_Pragma node if there was
   --    a Check_Policy or Assertion_Policy (or in the case of a Debug_Pragma)
   --    a Debug_Policy pragma that specified a policy of IGNORE, DISABLE, or
   --    OFF, for the pragma/aspect. If there was a Policy pragma specifying
   --    a Policy of ON or CHECK, then this flag is reset. If no Policy pragma
   --    gives a policy for the aspect or pragma, then there are two cases. For
   --    an assertion aspect or pragma (one of the assertion kinds allowed in
   --    an Assertion_Policy pragma), then Is_Ignored is set if assertions are
   --    ignored because of the absence of a -gnata switch. For any other
   --    aspects or pragmas, the flag is off. If this flag is set, the
   --    aspect/pragma is fully analyzed and checked for other syntactic
   --    and semantic errors, but it does not have any semantic effect.

   --  Is_Ignored_Ghost_Pragma
   --    This flag is present in N_Pragma nodes. It is set when the pragma is
   --    related to an ignored Ghost entity or encloses ignored Ghost entity.
   --    This flag has no relation to Is_Ignored.

   --  Is_In_Discriminant_Check
   --    This flag is present in a selected component, and is used to indicate
   --    that the reference occurs within a discriminant check. The
   --    significance is that optimizations based on assuming that the
   --    discriminant check has a correct value cannot be performed in this
   --    case (or the discriminant check may be optimized away).

   --  Is_Inherited_Pragma
   --    This flag is set in an N_Pragma node that appears in a N_Contract node
   --    to indicate that the pragma has been inherited from a parent context.

   --  Is_Initialization_Block
   --    Defined in block nodes. Set when the block statement was created by
   --    the finalization machinery to wrap initialization statements. This
   --    flag aids the ABE Processing phase to suppress the diagnostics of
   --    finalization actions in initialization contexts.

   --  Is_Known_Guaranteed_ABE
   --    NOTE: this flag is shared between the legacy ABE mechanism and the
   --    default ABE mechanism.
   --
   --    Present in the following nodes:
   --
   --      call marker
   --      formal package declaration
   --      function call
   --      function instantiation
   --      package instantiation
   --      procedure call statement
   --      procedure instantiation
   --
   --    Set when the elaboration or evaluation of the scenario results in
   --    a guaranteed ABE. The flag is used to suppress the instantiation of
   --    generic bodies because gigi cannot handle certain forms of premature
   --    instantiation, as well as to prevent the reexamination of the node by
   --    the ABE Processing phase.

   --  Is_Machine_Number
   --    This flag is set in an N_Real_Literal node to indicate that the value
   --    is a machine number. This avoids some unnecessary cases of converting
   --    real literals to machine numbers.

   --  Is_Null_Loop
   --    This flag is set in an N_Loop_Statement node if the corresponding loop
   --    can be determined to be null at compile time. This is used to remove
   --    the loop entirely at expansion time.

   --  Is_Overloaded
   --    A flag present in all expression nodes. Used temporarily during
   --    overloading determination. The setting of this flag is not relevant
   --    once overloading analysis is complete.

   --  Is_Parenthesis_Aggregate
   --    A flag set on an aggregate that uses parentheses as delimiters

   --  Is_Power_Of_2_For_Shift
   --    A flag present only in N_Op_Expon nodes. It is set when the
   --    exponentiation is of the form 2 ** N, where the type of N is an
   --    unsigned integral subtype whose size does not exceed the size of
   --    Standard_Integer (i.e. a type that can be safely converted to
   --    Natural), and the exponentiation appears as the right operand of an
   --    integer multiplication or an integer division where the dividend is
   --    unsigned. It is also required that overflow checking is off for both
   --    the exponentiation and the multiply/divide node. If this set of
   --    conditions holds, and the flag is set, then the division or
   --    multiplication can be (and is) converted to a shift.

   --  Is_Preelaborable_Call
   --    Present in call marker nodes. Set when the related call is non-static
   --    but preelaborable.

   --  Is_Prefixed_Call
   --    This flag is set in a selected component within a generic unit, if
   --    it resolves to a prefixed call to a primitive operation. The flag
   --    is used to prevent accidental overloadings in an instance, when a
   --    primitive operation and a private record component may be homographs.

   --  Is_Protected_Subprogram_Body
   --    A flag set in a Subprogram_Body block to indicate that it is the
   --    implementation of a protected subprogram. Such a body needs cleanup
   --    handler to make sure that the associated protected object is unlocked
   --    when the subprogram completes.

   --  Is_Qualified_Universal_Literal
   --    Present in N_Qualified_Expression nodes. Set when the qualification is
   --    converting a universal literal to a specific type. Such qualifiers aid
   --    the resolution of accidental overloading of binary or unary operators
   --    which may occur in instances.

   --  Is_Read
   --    Present in variable reference markers. Set when the original variable
   --    reference constitutes a read of the variable.

   --  Is_Source_Call
   --    Present in call marker nodes. Set when the related call came from
   --    source.

   --  Is_SPARK_Mode_On_Node
   --    Present in the following nodes:
   --
   --      assignment statement
   --      attribute reference
   --      call marker
   --      entry call statement
   --      expanded name
   --      function call
   --      function instantiation
   --      identifier
   --      package instantiation
   --      procedure call statement
   --      procedure instantiation
   --      requeue statement
   --      variable reference marker
   --
   --    Set when the node appears within a context subject to SPARK_Mode On.
   --    This flag determines when the SPARK model of elaboration be activated
   --    by the ABE Processing phase.

   --  Is_Static_Coextension
   --    Present in N_Allocator nodes. Set if the allocator is a coextension
   --    of an object allocated on the stack rather than the heap. The partner
   --    flag Is_Dynamic_Coextension must be cleared before setting this flag
   --    to True.

   --  Is_Static_Expression
   --    Indicates that an expression is a static expression according to the
   --    rules in RM-4.9. See Sem_Eval for details.

   --  Is_Subprogram_Descriptor
   --    Present in N_Object_Declaration, and set only for the object
   --    declaration generated for a subprogram descriptor in fast exception
   --    mode. See Exp_Ch11 for details of use.

   --  Is_Task_Allocation_Block
   --    A flag set in a Block_Statement node to indicate that it is the
   --    expansion of a task allocator, or the allocator of an object
   --    containing tasks. Such a block requires a cleanup handler to call
   --    Expunge_Unactivated_Tasks to complete any tasks that have been
   --    allocated but not activated when the allocator completes abnormally.

   --  Is_Task_Body_Procedure
   --    This flag is set on N_Subprogram_Declaration and N_Subprogram_Body
   --    nodes which emulate the body of a task unit.

   --  Is_Task_Master
   --    A flag set in a Subprogram_Body, Block_Statement, or Task_Body node to
   --    indicate that the construct is a task master (i.e. has declared tasks
   --    or declares an access to a task type).

   --  Is_Write
   --    Present in variable reference markers. Set when the original variable
   --    reference constitutes a write of the variable.

   --  Itype
   --    Used in N_Itype_Reference node to reference an itype for which it is
   --    important to ensure that it is defined. See description of this node
   --    for further details.

   --  Kill_Range_Check
   --    Used in an N_Unchecked_Type_Conversion node to indicate that the
   --    result should not be subjected to range checks. This is used for the
   --    implementation of Normalize_Scalars.

   --  Label_Construct
   --    Used in an N_Implicit_Label_Declaration node. Refers to an N_Label,
   --    N_Block_Statement or N_Loop_Statement node to which the label
   --    declaration applies. The field is left empty for the special labels
   --    generated as part of expanding raise statements with a local exception
   --    handler.

   --  Library_Unit
   --    In a stub node, Library_Unit points to the compilation unit node of
   --    the corresponding subunit.
   --
   --    In a with clause node, Library_Unit points to the spec of the with'ed
   --    unit.
   --
   --    In a compilation unit node, the usage depends on the unit type:
   --
   --     For a library unit body, Library_Unit points to the compilation unit
   --     node of the corresponding spec, unless it's a subprogram body with
   --     Acts_As_Spec set, in which case it points to itself.
   --
   --     For a spec, Library_Unit points to the compilation unit node of the
   --     corresponding body, if present. The body will be present if the spec
   --     is or contains generics that we needed to instantiate. Similarly, the
   --     body will be present if we needed it for inlining purposes. Thus, if
   --     we have a spec/body pair, both of which are present, they point to
   --     each other via Library_Unit.
   --
   --     For a subunit, Library_Unit points to the compilation unit node of
   --     the parent body.
   --     ??? not (always) true, in (at least some, maybe all?) cases it points
   --     to the corresponding spec for the parent body.
   --
   --    Note that this field is not used to hold the parent pointer for child
   --    unit (which might in any case need to use it for some other purpose as
   --    described above). Instead for a child unit, implicit with's are
   --    generated for all parents.

   --  Local_Raise_Statements
   --    This field is present in exception handler nodes. It is set to
   --    No_Elist in the normal case. If there is at least one raise statement
   --    which can potentially be handled as a local raise, then this field
   --    points to a list of raise nodes, which are calls to a routine to raise
   --    an exception. These are raise nodes which can be optimized into gotos
   --    if the handler turns out to meet the conditions which permit this
   --    transformation. Note that this does NOT include instances of the
   --    N_Raise_xxx_Error nodes since the transformation of these nodes is
   --    handled by the back end (using the N_Push/N_Pop mechanism).

   --  Loop_Actions
   --    A list present in Component_Association nodes in array aggregates.
   --    Used to collect actions that must be executed within the loop because
   --    they may need to be evaluated anew each time through.

   --  Limited_View_Installed
   --    Present in With_Clauses and in package specifications. If set on
   --    with_clause, it indicates that this clause has created the current
   --    limited view of the designated package. On a package specification, it
   --    indicates that the limited view has already been created because the
   --    package is mentioned in a limited_with_clause in the closure of the
   --    unit being compiled.

   --  Local_Raise_Not_OK
   --    Present in N_Exception_Handler nodes. Set if the handler contains
   --    a construct (reraise statement, or call to subprogram in package
   --    GNAT.Current_Exception) that makes the handler unsuitable as a target
   --    for a local raise (one that could otherwise be converted to a goto).

   --  Must_Be_Byte_Aligned
   --    This flag is present in N_Attribute_Reference nodes. It can be set
   --    only for the Address and Unrestricted_Access attributes. If set it
   --    means that the object for which the address/access is given must be on
   --    a byte (more accurately a storage unit) boundary. If necessary, a copy
   --    of the object is to be made before taking the address (this copy is in
   --    the current scope on the stack frame). This is used for certain cases
   --    of code generated by the expander that passes parameters by address.
   --
   --    The reason the copy is not made by the front end is that the back end
   --    has more information about type layout and may be able to (but is not
   --    guaranteed to) prevent making unnecessary copies.

   --  Must_Not_Freeze
   --    A flag present in all expression nodes. Normally expressions cause
   --    freezing as described in the RM. If this flag is set, then this is
   --    inhibited. This is used by the analyzer and expander to label nodes
   --    that are created by semantic analysis or expansion and which must not
   --    cause freezing even though they normally would. This flag is also
   --    present in an N_Subtype_Indication node, since we also use these in
   --    calls to Freeze_Expression.

   --  Next_Entity
   --    Present in defining identifiers, defining character literals, and
   --    defining operator symbols (i.e. in all entities). The entities of a
   --    scope are chained, and this field is used as the forward pointer for
   --    this list. See Einfo for further details.

   --  Next_Exit_Statement
   --    Present in N_Exit_Statement nodes. The exit statements for a loop are
   --    chained (in reverse order of appearance) from the First_Exit_Statement
   --    field of the E_Loop entity for the loop. Next_Exit_Statement points to
   --    the next entry on this chain (Empty = end of list).

   --  Next_Implicit_With
   --    Present in N_With_Clause. Part of a chain of with_clauses generated
   --    in rtsfind to indicate implicit dependencies on predefined units. Used
   --    to prevent multiple with_clauses for the same unit in a given context.
   --    A postorder traversal of the tree whose nodes are units and whose
   --    links are with_clauses defines the order in which CodePeer must
   --    examine a compiled unit and its full context. This ordering ensures
   --    that any subprogram call is examined after the subprogram declaration
   --    has been seen.

   --  Next_Named_Actual
   --    Present in parameter association nodes. Set during semantic analysis
   --    to point to the next named parameter, where parameters are ordered by
   --    declaration order (as opposed to the actual order in the call, which
   --    may be different due to named associations). Not that this field
   --    points to the explicit actual parameter itself, not to the
   --    N_Parameter_Association node (its parent).

   --  Next_Pragma
   --    Present in N_Pragma nodes. Used to create a linked list of pragma
   --    nodes. Currently used for two purposes:
   --
   --      Create a list of linked Check_Policy pragmas. The head of this list
   --      is stored in Opt.Check_Policy_List (which has further details).
   --
   --      Used by processing for Pre/Postcondition pragmas to store a list of
   --      pragmas associated with the spec of a subprogram (see Sem_Prag for
   --      details).
   --
   --      Used by processing for pragma SPARK_Mode to store multiple pragmas
   --      the apply to the same construct. These are visible/private mode for
   --      a package spec and declarative/statement mode for package body.

   --  Next_Rep_Item
   --    Present in pragma nodes, attribute definition nodes, enumeration rep
   --    clauses, record rep clauses, aspect specification and null statement
   --    nodes. Used to link representation items that apply to an entity. See
   --    full description of First_Rep_Item field in Einfo for further details.

   --  Next_Use_Clause
   --    While use clauses are active during semantic processing, they are
   --    chained from the scope stack entry, using Next_Use_Clause as a link
   --    pointer, with Empty marking the end of the list. The head pointer is
   --    in the scope stack entry (First_Use_Clause). At the end of semantic
   --    processing (i.e. when Gigi sees the tree, the contents of this field
   --    is undefined and should not be read).

   --  No_Ctrl_Actions
   --    Present in N_Assignment_Statement to indicate that no Finalize nor
   --    Adjust should take place on this assignment even though the RHS is
   --    controlled. Also indicates that the primitive _assign should not be
   --    used for a tagged assignment. This is used in init procs and aggregate
   --    expansions where the generated assignments are initializations, not
   --    real assignments.

   --  No_Elaboration_Check
   --    NOTE: this flag is relevant only for the legacy ABE mechanism and
   --    should not be used outside of that context.
   --
   --    Present in N_Function_Call and N_Procedure_Call_Statement. Indicates
   --    that no elaboration check is needed on the call, because it appears in
   --    the context of a local Suppress pragma. This is used on calls within
   --    task bodies, where the actual elaboration checks are applied after
   --    analysis, when the local scope stack is not present.

   --  No_Entities_Ref_In_Spec
   --    Present in N_With_Clause nodes. Set if the with clause is on the
   --    package or subprogram spec where the main unit is the corresponding
   --    body, and no entities of the with'ed unit are referenced by the spec
   --    (an entity may still be referenced in the body, so this flag is used
   --    to generate the proper message (see Sem_Util.Check_Unused_Withs for
   --    full details).

   --  No_Initialization
   --    Present in N_Object_Declaration and N_Allocator to indicate that the
   --    object must not be initialized (by Initialize or call to an init
   --    proc). This is needed for controlled aggregates. When the Object
   --    declaration has an expression, this flag means that this expression
   --    should not be taken into account (needed for in place initialization
   --    with aggregates, and for object with an address clause, which are
   --    initialized with an assignment at freeze time).

   --  No_Minimize_Eliminate
   --    This flag is present in membership operator nodes (N_In/N_Not_In).
   --    It is used to indicate that processing for extended overflow checking
   --    modes is not required (this is used to prevent infinite recursion).

   --  No_Side_Effect_Removal
   --    Present in N_Function_Call nodes. Set when a function call does not
   --    require side effect removal. This attribute suppresses the generation
   --    of a temporary to capture the result of the function which eventually
   --    replaces the function call.

   --  No_Truncation
   --    Present in N_Unchecked_Type_Conversion node. This flag has an effect
   --    only if the RM_Size of the source is greater than the RM_Size of the
   --    target for scalar operands. Normally in such a case we truncate some
   --    higher order bits of the source, and then sign/zero extend the result
   --    to form the output value. But if this flag is set, then we do not do
   --    any truncation, so for example, if an 8 bit input is converted to 5
   --    bit result which is in fact stored in 8 bits, then the high order
   --    three bits of the target result will be copied from the source. This
   --    is used for properly setting out of range values for use by pragmas
   --    Initialize_Scalars and Normalize_Scalars.

   --  Null_Excluding_Subtype
   --    Present in N_Access_To_Object_Definition. Indicates that the subtype
   --    indication carries a null-exclusion indicator, which is distinct from
   --    the null-exclusion indicator that may precede the access keyword.

   --  Original_Discriminant
   --    Present in identifiers. Used in references to discriminants that
   --    appear in generic units. Because the names of the discriminants may be
   --    different in an instance, we use this field to recover the position of
   --    the discriminant in the original type, and replace it with the
   --    discriminant at the same position in the instantiated type.

   --  Original_Entity
   --    Present in numeric literals. Used to denote the named number that has
   --    been constant-folded into the given literal. If literal is from
   --    source, or the result of some other constant-folding operation, then
   --    Original_Entity is empty. This field is needed to handle properly
   --    named numbers in generic units, where the Associated_Node field
   --    interferes with the Entity field, making it impossible to preserve the
   --    original entity at the point of instantiation.

   --  Others_Discrete_Choices
   --    When a case statement or variant is analyzed, the semantic checks
   --    determine the actual list of choices that correspond to an others
   --    choice. This list is materialized for later use by the expander and
   --    the Others_Discrete_Choices field of an N_Others_Choice node points to
   --    this materialized list of choices, which is in standard format for a
   --    list of discrete choices, except that of course it cannot contain an
   --    N_Others_Choice entry.

   --  Parent_Spec
   --    For a library unit that is a child unit spec (package or subprogram
   --    declaration, generic declaration or instantiation, or library level
   --    rename) this field points to the compilation unit node for the parent
   --    package specification. This field is Empty for library bodies (the
   --    parent spec in this case can be found from the corresponding spec).

   --  Parent_With
   --    Present in N_With_Clause nodes. The flag indicates that the clause
   --    was generated for an ancestor unit to provide proper visibility. A
   --    with clause for child unit A.B.C produces two implicit parent with
   --    clauses for A and A.B.

   --  Premature_Use
   --    Present in N_Incomplete_Type_Declaration node. Used for improved
   --    error diagnostics: if there is a premature usage of an incomplete
   --    type, a subsequently generated error message indicates the position
   --    of its full declaration.

   --  Present_Expr
   --    Present in an N_Variant node. This has a meaningful value only after
   --    Gigi has back annotated the tree with representation information. At
   --    this point, it contains a reference to a gcc expression that depends
   --    on the values of one or more discriminants. Given a set of
   --    discriminant values, this expression evaluates to False (zero) if
   --    variant is not present, and True (non-zero) if it is present. See
   --    unit Repinfo for further details on gigi back annotation. This field
   --    is used during back-annotation processing (for -gnatR -gnatc) to
   --    determine if a field is present or not.

   --  Prev_Use_Clause
   --    Present in both N_Use_Package_Clause and N_Use_Type_Clause. Used in
   --    detection of ineffective use clauses by allowing a chain of related
   --    clauses together to avoid traversing the current scope stack.

   --  Print_In_Hex
   --    Set on an N_Integer_Literal node to indicate that the value should be
   --    printed in hexadecimal in the sprint listing. Has no effect on
   --    legality or semantics of program, only on the displayed output. This
   --    is used to clarify output from the packed array cases.

   --  Procedure_To_Call
   --    Present in N_Allocator, N_Free_Statement, N_Simple_Return_Statement,
   --    and N_Extended_Return_Statement nodes. References the entity for the
   --    declaration of the procedure to be called to accomplish the required
   --    operation (i.e. for the Allocate procedure in the case of N_Allocator
   --    and N_Simple_Return_Statement and N_Extended_Return_Statement (for
   --    allocating the return value), and for the Deallocate procedure in the
   --    case of N_Free_Statement.

   --  Raises_Constraint_Error
   --    Set on an expression whose evaluation will definitely fail constraint
   --    error check. See Sem_Eval for details.

   --  Redundant_Use
   --    Present in nodes that can appear as an operand in a use clause or use
   --    type clause (identifiers, expanded names, attribute references). Set
   --    to indicate that a use is redundant (and therefore need not be undone
   --    on scope exit).

   --  Renaming_Exception
   --    Present in N_Exception_Declaration node. Used to point back to the
   --    exception renaming for an exception declared within a subprogram.
   --    What happens is that an exception declared in a subprogram is moved
   --    to the library level with a unique name, and the original exception
   --    becomes a renaming. This link from the library level exception to the
   --    renaming declaration allows registering of the proper exception name.

   --  Return_Statement_Entity
   --    Present in N_Simple_Return_Statement and N_Extended_Return_Statement.
   --    Points to an E_Return_Statement representing the return statement.

   --  Return_Object_Declarations
   --    Present in N_Extended_Return_Statement. Points to a list initially
   --    containing a single N_Object_Declaration representing the return
   --    object. We use a list (instead of just a pointer to the object decl)
   --    because Analyze wants to insert extra actions on this list, before the
   --    N_Object_Declaration, which always remains last on the list.

   --  Rounded_Result
   --    Present in N_Type_Conversion, N_Op_Divide, and N_Op_Multiply nodes.
   --    Used in the fixed-point cases to indicate that the result must be
   --    rounded as a result of the use of the 'Round attribute. Also used for
   --    integer N_Op_Divide nodes to indicate that the result should be
   --    rounded to the nearest integer (breaking ties away from zero), rather
   --    than truncated towards zero as usual. These rounded integer operations
   --    are the result of expansion of rounded fixed-point divide, conversion
   --    and multiplication operations.

   --  Save_Invocation_Graph_Of_Body
   --    Present in compilation unit nodes. Set when the elaboration mechanism
   --    must record all invocation constructs and invocation relations within
   --    the body of the compilation unit.
   --
   --  SCIL_Entity
   --    Present in SCIL nodes. References the specific tagged type associated
   --    with the SCIL node (for an N_SCIL_Dispatching_Call node, this is
   --    the controlling type of the call; for an N_SCIL_Membership_Test node
   --    generated as part of testing membership in T'Class, this is T; for an
   --    N_SCIL_Dispatch_Table_Tag_Init node, this is the type being declared).

   --  SCIL_Controlling_Tag
   --    Present in N_SCIL_Dispatching_Call nodes. References the controlling
   --    tag of a dispatching call. This is usually an N_Selected_Component
   --    node (for a _tag component), but may be an N_Object_Declaration or
   --    N_Parameter_Specification node in some cases (e.g., for a call to
   --    a classwide streaming operation or a call to an instance of
   --    Ada.Tags.Generic_Dispatching_Constructor).

   --  SCIL_Tag_Value
   --    Present in N_SCIL_Membership_Test nodes. Used to reference the tag
   --    of the value that is being tested.

   --  SCIL_Target_Prim
   --    Present in N_SCIL_Dispatching_Call nodes. References the primitive
   --    operation named (statically) in a dispatching call.

   --  Scope
   --    Present in defining identifiers, defining character literals, and
   --    defining operator symbols (i.e. in all entities). The entities of a
   --    scope all use this field to reference the corresponding scope entity.
   --    See Einfo for further details.

   --  Shift_Count_OK
   --    A flag present in shift nodes to indicate that the shift count is
   --    known to be in range, i.e. is in the range from zero to word length
   --    minus one. If this flag is not set, then the shift count may be
   --    outside this range, i.e. larger than the word length, and the code
   --    must ensure that such shift counts give the appropriate result.

   --  Source_Type
   --    Used in an N_Validate_Unchecked_Conversion node to point to the
   --    source type entity for the unchecked conversion instantiation
   --    which gigi must do size validation for.

   --  Split_PPC
   --    When a Pre or Post aspect specification is processed, it is broken
   --    into AND THEN sections. The leftmost section has Split_PPC set to
   --    False, indicating that it is the original specification (e.g. for
   --    posting errors). For other sections, Split_PPC is set to True.
   --    This flag is set in both the N_Aspect_Specification node itself,
   --    and in the pragma which is generated from this node.

   --  Storage_Pool
   --    Present in N_Allocator, N_Free_Statement, N_Simple_Return_Statement,
   --    and N_Extended_Return_Statement nodes. References the entity for the
   --    storage pool to be used for the allocate or free call or for the
   --    allocation of the returned value from function. Empty indicates that
   --    the global default pool is to be used. Note that in the case
   --    of a return statement, this field is set only if the function returns
   --    value of a type whose size is not known at compile time on the
   --    secondary stack.

   --  Suppress_Assignment_Checks
   --    Used in generated N_Assignment_Statement nodes to suppress predicate
   --    and range checks in cases where the generated code knows that the
   --    value being assigned is in range and satisfies any predicate. Also
   --    can be set in N_Object_Declaration nodes, to similarly suppress any
   --    checks on the initializing value. In assignment statements it also
   --    suppresses access checks in the generated code for out- and in-out
   --    parameters in entry calls, as well as length checks.

   --  Suppress_Loop_Warnings
   --    Used in N_Loop_Statement node to indicate that warnings within the
   --    body of the loop should be suppressed. This is set when the range
   --    of a FOR loop is known to be null, or is probably null (loop would
   --    only execute if invalid values are present).

   --  Target
   --    Present in call and variable reference marker nodes. References the
   --    entity of the original entity, operator, or subprogram being invoked,
   --    or the original variable being read or written.

   --  Target_Type
   --    Used in an N_Validate_Unchecked_Conversion node to point to the target
   --    type entity for the unchecked conversion instantiation which gigi must
   --    do size validation for.

   --  Then_Actions
   --    This field is present in if expression nodes. During code expansion
   --    we use the Insert_Actions procedure (in Exp_Util) to insert actions
   --    at an appropriate place in the tree to get elaborated at the right
   --    time. For if expressions, we have to be sure that the actions for
   --    for the Then branch are only elaborated if the condition is True.
   --    The Then_Actions field is used as a temporary parking place for
   --    these actions. The final tree is always rewritten to eliminate the
   --    need for this field, so in the tree passed to Gigi, this field is
   --    always set to No_List.

   --  TSS_Elist
   --    Present in N_Freeze_Entity nodes. Holds an element list containing
   --    entries for each TSS (type support subprogram) associated with the
   --    frozen type. The elements of the list are the entities for the
   --    subprograms (see package Exp_TSS for further details). Set to No_Elist
   --    if there are no type support subprograms for the type or if the freeze
   --    node is not for a type.

   --  Uneval_Old_Accept
   --    Present in N_Pragma nodes. Set True if Opt.Uneval_Old is set to 'A'
   --    (accept) at the point where the pragma is encountered (including the
   --    case of a pragma generated from an aspect specification). It is this
   --    setting that is relevant, rather than the setting at the point where
   --    a contract is finally analyzed after the delay till the freeze point.

   --  Uneval_Old_Warn
   --    Present in N_Pragma nodes. Set True if Opt.Uneval_Old is set to 'W'
   --    (warn) at the point where the pragma is encountered (including the
   --    case of a pragma generated from an aspect specification). It is this
   --    setting that is relevant, rather than the setting at the point where
   --    a contract is finally analyzed after the delay till the freeze point.

   --  Unreferenced_In_Spec
   --    Present in N_With_Clause nodes. Set if the with clause is on the
   --    package or subprogram spec where the main unit is the corresponding
   --    body, and is not referenced by the spec (it may still be referenced by
   --    the body, so this flag is used to generate the proper message (see
   --    Sem_Util.Check_Unused_Withs for details)

   --  Uninitialized_Variable
   --    Present in N_Formal_Private_Type_Definition and in N_Private_
   --    Extension_Declarations. Indicates that a variable in a generic unit
   --    whose type is a formal private or derived type is read without being
   --    initialized. Used to warn if the corresponding actual type is not
   --    a fully initialized type.

   --  Used_Operations
   --    Present in N_Use_Type_Clause nodes. Holds the list of operations that
   --    are made potentially use-visible by the clause. Simplifies processing
   --    on exit from the scope of the use_type_clause, in particular in the
   --    case of Use_All_Type, when those operations several scopes.

   --  Was_Attribute_Reference
   --    Present in N_Subprogram_Body. Set to True if the original source is an
   --    attribute reference which is an actual in a generic instantiation. The
   --    instantiation prologue renames these attributes, and expansion later
   --    converts them into subprogram bodies.

   --  Was_Expression_Function
   --    Present in N_Subprogram_Body. True if the original source had an
   --    N_Expression_Function, which was converted to the N_Subprogram_Body
   --    by Analyze_Expression_Function.

   --  Was_Originally_Stub
   --    This flag is set in the node for a proper body that replaces stub.
   --    During the analysis procedure, stubs in some situations get rewritten
   --    by the corresponding bodies, and we set this flag to remember that
   --    this happened. Note that it is not good enough to rely on the use of
   --    Original_Node here because of the case of nested instantiations where
   --    the substituted node can be copied.

   --------------------------------------------------
   -- Note on Use of End_Label and End_Span Fields --
   --------------------------------------------------

   --  Several constructs have end lines:

   --    Loop Statement             end loop [loop_IDENTIFIER];
   --    Package Specification      end [[PARENT_UNIT_NAME .] IDENTIFIER]
   --    Task Definition            end [task_IDENTIFIER]
   --    Protected Definition       end [protected_IDENTIFIER]
   --    Protected Body             end [protected_IDENTIFIER]

   --    Block Statement            end [block_IDENTIFIER];
   --    Subprogram Body            end [DESIGNATOR];
   --    Package Body               end [[PARENT_UNIT_NAME .] IDENTIFIER];
   --    Task Body                  end [task_IDENTIFIER];
   --    Accept Statement           end [entry_IDENTIFIER]];
   --    Entry Body                 end [entry_IDENTIFIER];

   --    If Statement               end if;
   --    Case Statement             end case;

   --    Record Definition          end record;
   --    Enumeration Definition     );

   --  The End_Label and End_Span fields are used to mark the locations of
   --  these lines, and also keep track of the label in the case where a label
   --  is present.

   --  For the first group above, the End_Label field of the corresponding node
   --  is used to point to the label identifier. In the case where there is no
   --  label in the source, the parser supplies a dummy identifier (with
   --  Comes_From_Source set to False), and the Sloc of this dummy identifier
   --  marks the location of the token following the END token.

   --  For the second group, the use of End_Label is similar, but the End_Label
   --  is found in the N_Handled_Sequence_Of_Statements node. This is done
   --  simply because in some cases there is no room in the parent node.

   --  For the third group, there is never any label, and instead of using
   --  End_Label, we use the End_Span field which gives the location of the
   --  token following END, relative to the starting Sloc of the construct,
   --  i.e. add Sloc (Node) + End_Span (Node) to get the Sloc of the IF or CASE
   --  following the End_Label.

   --  The record definition case is handled specially, we treat it as though
   --  it required an optional label which is never present, and so the parser
   --  always builds a dummy identifier with Comes From Source set False. The
   --  reason we do this, rather than using End_Span in this case, is that we
   --  want to generate a cross-ref entry for the end of a record, since it
   --  represents a scope for name declaration purposes.

   --  The enumeration definition case is handled in an exactly similar manner,
   --  building a dummy identifier to get a cross-reference.

   --  Note: the reason we store the difference as a Uint, instead of storing
   --  the Source_Ptr value directly, is that Source_Ptr values cannot be
   --  distinguished from other types of values, and we count on all general
   --  use fields being self describing. To make things easier for clients,
   --  note that we provide function End_Location, and procedure
   --  Set_End_Location to allow access to the logical value (which is the
   --  Source_Ptr value for the end token).

      -- 2.3  Identifier --
      ---------------------

      --  IDENTIFIER ::= IDENTIFIER_LETTER {[UNDERLINE] LETTER_OR_DIGIT}
      --  LETTER_OR_DIGIT ::= IDENTIFIER_LETTER | DIGIT

      --  An IDENTIFIER shall not be a reserved word

      --  In the Ada grammar identifiers are the bottom level tokens which have
      --  very few semantics. Actual program identifiers are direct names. If
      --  we were being 100% honest with the grammar, then we would have a node
      --  called N_Direct_Name which would point to an identifier. However,
      --  that's too many extra nodes, so we just use the N_Identifier node
      --  directly as a direct name, and it contains the expression fields and
      --  Entity field that correspond to its use as a direct name. In those
      --  few cases where identifiers appear in contexts where they are not
      --  direct names (pragmas, pragma argument associations, attribute
      --  references and attribute definition clauses), the Chars field of the
      --  node contains the Name_Id for the identifier name.

      --  Note: in GNAT, a reserved word can be treated as an identifier in two
      --  cases. First, an incorrect use of a reserved word as an identifier is
      --  diagnosed and then treated as a normal identifier. Second, an
      --  attribute designator of the form of a reserved word (access, delta,
      --  digits, range) is treated as an identifier.

      --  Note: The set of letters that is permitted in an identifier depends
      --  on the character set in use. See package Csets for full details.

      --  N_Identifier
      --  Sloc points to identifier

      --  Decimal literals appear in the tree as either integer literal nodes
      --  or real literal nodes, depending on whether a period is present.

      --  Note: literal nodes appear as a result of direct use of literals
      --  in the source program, and also as the result of evaluating
      --  expressions at compile time. In the latter case, it is possible
      --  to construct real literals that have no syntactic representation

      --  We allow this special usage in all Ada modes, but it would be a

      --  replace these ASPECT_MARK forms with identifiers whose name is one
      --  of the special internal names _Pre, _Post, or _Type_Invariant.

      --  We do a similar replacement of these Aspect_Mark forms in the

      --  Note: [For Ada 2005 (AI-231)]: Because Ada 2005 extends this rule

      --  attribute in all the parents of subtype_indication nodes to indicate
      --  if the null-exclusion is present.

      --  Note: the reason that this node has expression fields is that a

      --  initializing expression is an aggregate which requires explicit
      --  assignments, the Expression field gets set to Empty, but this flag
      --  is still set, so we don't forget we had an initializing expression.

      --  Note: if a range check is required for the initialization

      --  the Expression may not have the form of an aggregate (since this

      --  ATTRIBUTE_REFERENCE ::= PREFIX ' ATTRIBUTE_DESIGNATOR

      --  Note: the syntax is quite ambiguous at this point. Consider:

      --    A'Length (X)  X is part of the attribute designator
      --    A'Pos (X)     X is an explicit actual parameter of function A'Pos
      --    A'Class (X)   X is the expression of a type conversion

      --  It would be possible for the parser to distinguish these cases
      --  by looking at the attribute identifier. However, that would mean
      --  more work in introducing new implementation defined attributes,
      --  and also it would mean that special processing for attributes
      --  would be scattered around, instead of being centralized in the
      --  semantic routine that handles an N_Attribute_Reference node.
      --  Consequently, the parser in all the above cases stores the
      --  expression (X in these examples) as a single element list in
      --  in the Expressions field of the N_Attribute_Reference node.

      --  Similarly, for attributes like Max which take two arguments,
      --  we store the two arguments as a two element list in the
      --  Expressions field. Of course it is clear at parse time that
      --  this case is really a function call with an attribute as the
      --  prefix, but it turns out to be convenient to handle the two
      --  argument case in a similar manner to the one argument case,
      --  and indeed in general the parser will accept any number of
      --  expressions in this position and store them as a list in the
      --  attribute reference node. This allows for future addition of
      --  attributes that take more than two arguments.

      --  Note: named associates are not permitted in function calls where
      --  the function is an attribute (see RM 6.4(3)) so it is legitimate
      --  to skip the normal subprogram argument processing.

      --  Note: for the attributes whose designators are technically keywords,
      --  i.e. digits, access, delta, range, the Attribute_Name field contains
      --  the corresponding name, even though no identifier is involved.

      --  Note: the generated code may contain stream attributes applied to
      --  limited types for which no stream routines exist officially. In such
      --  case, the result is to use the stream attribute for the underlying
      --  full type, or in the case of a protected type, the components
      --  (including any discriminants) are merely streamed in order.

      --  See Exp_Attr for a complete description of which attributes are
      --  passed onto Gigi, and which are handled entirely by the front end.

      --  Gigi restriction: For the Pos attribute, the prefix cannot be
      --  a non-standard enumeration type or a nonzero/zero semantics
      --  boolean type, so the value is simply the stored representation.

      --  Gigi requirement: For the Mechanism_Code attribute, if the prefix
      --  references a subprogram that is a renaming, then the front end must
      --  rewrite the attribute to refer directly to the renamed entity.

      --  Note: syntactically the prefix of an attribute reference must be a
      --  name, and this (somewhat artificial) requirement is enforced by the
      --  parser. However, for many attributes, such as 'Valid, it is quite
      --  reasonable to apply the attribute to any value, and hence to any
      --  expression. Internally in the tree, the prefix is an expression which
      --  does not have to be a name, and this is handled fine by the semantic
      --  analysis and expansion, and back ends. This arises for the case of
      --  attribute references built by the expander (e.g. 'Valid for the case
      --  of an implicit validity check).

      --  Note: In generated code, the Address and Unrestricted_Access
      --  attributes can be applied to any expression, and the meaning is
      --  to create an object containing the value (the object is in the
      --  current stack frame), and pass the address of this value. If the
      --  Must_Be_Byte_Aligned flag is set, then the object whose address
      --  is taken must be on a byte (storage unit) boundary, and if it is
      --  not (or may not be), then the generated code must create a copy
      --  that is byte aligned, and pass the address of this copy.

      --  Note: this structure is used for both record and array aggregates

      --  makes no attempt to enforce consistency here, so it is up to the
      --  semantic phase to make sure that the aggregate is consistent (i.e.
      --  that it is not a "half-and-half" case that mixes record and array
      --  syntax). In particular, for a record aggregate, the expressions
      --  field will be set if there are positional associations.

      --  Note: N_Aggregate is not used for all aggregates; in particular,
      --  there is a separate node kind for extension aggregates.

      --  Note: gigi/gcc can handle array aggregates correctly providing that
      --  they are entirely positional, and the array subtype involved has a
      --  known at compile time length and is not bit packed, or a convention
      --  Fortran array with more than one dimension. If these conditions
      --  are not met, then the front end must translate the aggregate into
      --  an appropriate set of assignments into a temporary.

      --  Note: for the record aggregate case, gigi/gcc can handle most cases
      --  of record aggregates, including those for packed, and rep-claused
      --  records, and also variant records, providing that there are no
      --  variable length fields whose size is not known at compile time,
      --  and providing that the aggregate is presented in fully named form.

      --  The other situation in which array aggregates and record aggregates
      --  cannot be passed to the back end is if assignment to one or more
      --  components itself needs expansion, e.g. in the case of an assignment
      --  of an object of a controlled type. In such cases, the front end
      --  must expand the aggregate to a series of assignments, and apply
      --  the required expansion to the individual assignment statements.

      --  Usually there is no explicit node in the tree for primary. Instead

      --  exceptions. First, there is an explicit node for a null primary.

      --  N_Null
      --  Sloc points to NULL
      --  plus fields for expression

      --  Second, the case of (EXPRESSION) is handled specially. Ada requires
      --  that the parser keep track of which subexpressions are enclosed
      --  in parentheses, and how many levels of parentheses are used. This
      --  information is required for optimization purposes, and also for
      --  some semantic checks (e.g. (((1))) in a procedure spec does not
      --  conform with ((((1)))) in the body).

      --  The parentheses are recorded by keeping a Paren_Count field in every
      --  subexpression node (it is actually present in all nodes, but only
      --  used in subexpression nodes). This count records the number of
      --  levels of parentheses. If the number of levels in the source exceeds
      --  the maximum accommodated by this count, then the count is simply left
      --  at the maximum value. This means that there are some pathological
      --  cases of failure to detect conformance failures (e.g. an expression
      --  with 500 levels of parens will conform with one with 501 levels),
      --  but we do not need to lose sleep over this.

      --  Historical note: in versions of GNAT prior to 1.75, there was a node
      --  type N_Parenthesized_Expression used to accurately record unlimited
      --  numbers of levels of parentheses. However, it turned out to be a
      --  real nuisance to have to take into account the possible presence of
      --  this node during semantic analysis, since basically parentheses have
      --  zero relevance to semantic analysis.

      --  Note: the level of parentheses always present in things like
      --  aggregates does not count, only the parentheses in the primary

      --    RELATION {and then RELATION} | RELATION {or else RELATION}

      --  Gigi restriction: For both these control forms, the operand and
      --  result types are always Standard.Boolean. The expander inserts the
      --  required conversion operations where needed to ensure this is the

      --  MEMBERSHIP_CHOICE ::=
      --    CHOICE_EXPRESSION | RANGE | SUBTYPE_MARK

      --  Note: although the grammar above allows only a range or a subtype
      --  mark, the parser in fact will accept any simple expression in place
      --  of a subtype mark. This means that the semantic analyzer must be able
      --  to deal with, and diagnose a simple expression other than a name for
      --  the right operand. This simplifies error recovery in the parser.

      --  The Alternatives field below is present only if there is more than

      --  the list of choices. In the tree passed to the back end, Alternatives
      --  is always No_List, and Right_Opnd is set (i.e. the expansion circuit
      --  expands out the complex set membership case using simple membership

      --  See also shift operators in section B.2

      --  Note on fixed-point operations passed to Gigi: For adding operators,
      --  the semantics is to treat these simply as integer operations, with
      --  the small values being ignored (the bounds are already stored in
      --  units of small, so that constraint checking works as usual). For the
      --  case of multiply/divide/rem/mod operations, Gigi will never see them.

      --  Note on equality/inequality tests for records. In the expanded tree,
      --  record comparisons are always expanded to be a series of component
      --  comparisons, so the back end will never see an equality or inequality
      --  operation with operands of a record type.

      --  Note on overflow handling: When the overflow checking mode is set to
      --  MINIMIZED or ELIMINATED, nodes for signed arithmetic operations may
      --  be modified to use a larger type for the operands and result. In
      --  the case where the computed range exceeds that of Long_Long_Integer,
      --  and we are running in ELIMINATED mode, the operator node will be
      --  changed to be a call to the appropriate routine in System.Bignums.

      --  Note: In Modify_Tree_For_C mode, we do not generate an N_Op_Mod node
      --  for signed integer types (since there is no equivalent operator in
      --  C). Instead we rewrite such an operation in terms of REM (which is
      --  % in C) and other C-available operators.

      --  Note: the Then_Actions and Else_Actions fields are always set to

      --  In the (NAME) case, the name is stored as the expression

      --  Note: the parser never generates a type conversion node, since it

      --  and also all conversions from integer to floating-point types.
      --  Conversions from floating-point to integer are only handled in

      --  Sprint syntax if Float_Truncate set: X^(Y)
      --  Sprint syntax if Conversion_OK set X?(Y)
      --  Sprint syntax if both flags set X?^(Y)

      --  Note: If either the operand or result type is fixed-point, Gigi will
      --  only see a type conversion node with Conversion_OK set. The front end
      --  takes care of all handling of small's for fixed-point conversions.

      --    SUBTYPE_MARK ' (EXPRESSION) | SUBTYPE_MARK ' AGGREGATE

      --  Note: the parentheses in the (EXPRESSION) case are deemed to enclose

      --  Note: like all nodes, the N_Allocator has the Comes_From_Source flag.
      --  This flag has a special function in conjunction with the restriction
      --  No_Implicit_Heap_Allocations, which will be triggered if this flag
      --  is not set. This means that if a source allocator is replaced with

      --  Note: the back end places some restrictions on the form of the

      --  Note: there is always a loop statement identifier present in the

      --  creates an identifier, setting the Has_Created_Identifier flag to

      --  Note that the occurrence of a block identifier is not a defining

      --  occurrence is an E_Block entity declared by the implicit label
      --  declaration which occurs in the innermost enclosing block statement

      --  For block statements that come from source code, there is always a
      --  block statement identifier present in the tree, denoting an E_Block.
      --  In the case where no block identifier is given in the source,
      --  the parser creates a name of the form B_n, where n is a decimal
      --  integer, and the flag Has_Created_Identifier is set to True. Blocks
      --  constructed by the expander usually have no identifier, and no
      --  corresponding entity.

      --  Note: the block statement created for an extended return statement
      --  has an entity, and this entity is an E_Return_Statement, rather than
      --  the usual E_Block.

      --  Note: Exception_Junk is set for the wrapping blocks created during
      --  local raise optimization (Exp_Ch11.Expand_Local_Exception_Handlers).

      --  Note: from a control flow viewpoint, a block statement defines an
      --  extended basic block, i.e. the entry of the block dominates every
      --  statement in the sequence. When generating new statements with
      --  exception handlers in the expander at the end of a sequence that
      --  comes from source code, it can be necessary to wrap them all in a

      --  There is no explicit node in the tree for a compilation, since in
      --  general the compiler is processing only a single compilation unit
      --  at a time. It is possible to parse multiple units in syntax check
      --  only mode, but the trees are discarded in that case.

      ------------------------------
      -- 10.1.1  Compilation Unit --
      ------------------------------

      --  COMPILATION_UNIT ::=
      --    CONTEXT_CLAUSE LIBRARY_ITEM
      --  | CONTEXT_CLAUSE SUBUNIT

      --  The N_Compilation_Unit node itself represents the above syntax.
      --  However, there are two additional items not reflected in the above
      --  syntax. First we have the global declarations that are added by the
      --  code generator. These are outer level declarations (so they cannot
      --  be represented as being inside the units). An example is the wrapper
      --  subprograms that are created to do ABE checking. As always a list of
      --  declarations can contain actions as well (i.e. statements), and such
      --  statements are executed as part of the elaboration of the unit. Note
      --  that all such declarations are elaborated before the library unit.

      --  Similarly, certain actions need to be elaborated at the completion
      --  of elaboration of the library unit (notably the statement that sets
      --  the Boolean flag indicating that elaboration is complete).

      --  The third item not reflected in the syntax is pragmas that appear
      --  after the compilation unit. As always pragmas are a problem since
      --  they are not part of the formal syntax, but can be stuck into the
      --  source following a set of ad hoc rules, and we have to find an ad
      --  hoc way of sticking them into the tree. For pragmas that appear
      --  before the library unit, we just consider them to be part of the
      --  context clause, and pragmas can appear in the Context_Items list
      --  of the compilation unit. However, pragmas can also appear after
      --  the library item.

      --  To deal with all these problems, we create an auxiliary node for
      --  a compilation unit, referenced from the N_Compilation_Unit node,
      --  that contains these items.

      --  N_Compilation_Unit

      --  both of the flags First_Name and Last_Name are set in this name.

      --  Note: in the case of implicit with's that are installed by the

      --  Note: if the WITH clause refers to a standard library unit, then a

      --    [exception
      --      EXCEPTION_HANDLER
      --      {EXCEPTION_HANDLER}]
      --    [at end
      --      cleanup_procedure_call (param, param, param, ...);]

      --  The AT END phrase is a GNAT extension to provide for cleanups. It is
      --  used only internally currently, but is considered to be syntactic.
      --  At the moment, the only cleanup action allowed is a single call to a
      --  parameterless procedure; this restriction could be lifted if we make
      --  some changes in gigi. The At_End_Proc field is an N_Identifier node
      --  that denotes the procedure to be called. The cleanup action occurs
      --  whenever the sequence of statements is left for any reason. The
      --  possible reasons are:
      --
      --      1. reaching the end of the sequence
      --      2. exit, return, or goto
      --      3. exception or abort
      --
      --  The cleanup action also occurs whenever the exception handlers are
      --  left.

      --  The AT END cleanup handler protects only the sequence of statements
      --  and the exception handlers (not the associated declarations of
      --  the parent), just like exception handlers do not protect the
      --  declarations. The big difference is that the cleanup actions occur
      --  on either a normal or an abnormal exit from the statement sequence.

      --  Note: the list of Exception_Handlers can contain pragmas as well
      --  as actual handlers. In practice these pragmas can only occur at
      --  the start of the list, since any pragmas occurring later on will
      --  be included in the statement list of the corresponding handler.

      --  Note: although in the Ada syntax, the sequence of statements in
      --  a handled sequence of statements can only contain statements, we
      --  allow free mixing of declarations and statements in the resulting
      --  expanded tree. This is for example used to deal with the case of
      --  a cleanup procedure that must handle declarations as well as the
      --  statements of a block.

      --  Note: the cleanup_procedure_call does not go through the common
      --  processing for calls, which in particular means that it will not be
      --  automatically inlined in all cases, even though the procedure to be
      --  called is marked inline. More specifically, if the procedure comes
      --  from another unit than the main source unit, for example a run-time
      --  unit, then it needs to be manually added to the list of bodies to be
      --  inlined by invoking Add_Inlined_Body on it.

      --  First_Real_Statement

      --  Note: A Handled_Sequence_Of_Statements can contain both
      --  Exception_Handlers and an At_End_Proc.

      --  Note: the parent always contains a Declarations field which contains
      --  declarations associated with the handled sequence of statements. This
      --  is true even in the case of an accept statement (see description of
      --  the N_Accept_Statement node).

      --  The construct DIRECT_NAME'ATTRIBUTE_DESIGNATOR appears in the tree

      ---------------------------------------
      -- 13.3  Attribute definition clause --

      --  ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION_CLAUSE ::=
      --    for LOCAL_NAME'ATTRIBUTE_DESIGNATOR use EXPRESSION;
      --  | for LOCAL_NAME'ATTRIBUTE_DESIGNATOR use NAME;

      --  In Ada 83, the expression must be a simple expression and the
      --  local name must be a direct name.

      --  Note: the only attribute definition clause that is processed by
      --  gigi is an address clause. For all other cases, the information
      --  is extracted by the front end and either results in setting entity
      --  information, e.g. Esize for the Size clause, or in appropriate
      --  expansion actions (e.g. in the case of Storage_Size).

      --  For an address clause, Gigi constructs the appropriate addressing
      --  code. It also ensures that no aliasing optimizations are made
      --  for the object for which the address clause appears.

      --  Note: for an address clause used to achieve an overlay:

      --    A : Integer;
      --    B : Integer;
      --    for B'Address use A'Address;

      --  the above rule means that Gigi will ensure that no optimizations
      --  will be made for B that would violate the implementation advice
      --  of RM 13.3(19). However, this advice applies only to B and not
      --  to A, which seems unfortunate. The GNAT front end will mark the
      --  object A as volatile to also prevent unwanted optimization
      --  assumptions based on no aliasing being made for B.

      -----------------------------------
      -- 13.3.1  Aspect Specifications --
      -----------------------------------

      --  We modify the RM grammar here, the RM grammar is:

      --       with ASPECT_MARK [=> ASPECT_DEFINITION] {,
      --            ASPECT_MARK [=> ASPECT_DEFINITION] }

      --     ASPECT_MARK ::= aspect_IDENTIFIER['Class]

      --     ASPECT_DEFINITION ::= NAME | EXPRESSION

      --  That's inconvenient, since there is no non-terminal name for a single
      --  entry in the list of aspects. So we use this grammar instead:

      --     ASPECT_SPECIFICATIONS ::=
      --       with ASPECT_SPECIFICATION {, ASPECT_SPECIFICATION}

      --     ASPECT_SPECIFICATION =>
      --       ASPECT_MARK [=> ASPECT_DEFINITION]

      --     ASPECT_MARK ::= aspect_IDENTIFIER['Class]

      --     ASPECT_DEFINITION ::= NAME | EXPRESSION

      --  Note that for Annotate, the ASPECT_DEFINITION is a pure positional
      --  aggregate with the elements of the aggregate corresponding to the
      --  successive arguments of the corresponding pragma.

      --  See separate package Aspects for details on the incorporation of

      --  Split_PPC Set if split pre/post attribute
      --  Aspect_On_Partial_View

      --  Note: Aspect_Specification is an Ada 2012 feature

      --  Note: The Identifier serves to identify the aspect involved (it
      --  is the aspect whose name corresponds to the Chars field). This
      --  means that the other fields of this identifier are unused, and
      --  in particular we use the Entity field of this identifier to save
      --  a copy of the expression for visibility analysis, see spec of
      --  Sem_Ch13 for full details of this usage.

      --  In the case of aspects of the form xxx'Class, the aspect identifier
      --  is for xxx, and Class_Present is set to True.

      --  Note: When a Pre or Post aspect specification is processed, it is
      --  broken into AND THEN sections. The left most section has Split_PPC
      --  set to False, indicating that it is the original specification (e.g.
      --  for posting errors). For the other sections, Split_PPC is set True.

      --  Note: in Ada 83, the expression must be a simple expression

      --  Gigi restriction: this node never appears. It is replaced
      --  by a corresponding Alignment attribute definition clause.

      --  Note: pragmas can appear before and after the MOD_CLAUSE since
      --  its name has "clause" in it. This is rather strange, but is quite
      --  definitely specified. The pragmas before are collected in the

   -- Semantic Nodes --

   --  These semantic nodes are used to hold additional semantic information.
   --  They are inserted into the tree as a result of semantic processing.
   --  Although there are no legitimate source syntax constructions that

   --  reconstructed tree printed by Sprint, and the node descriptions here
   --  show this syntax.

      -- Call_Marker --
      -----------------

      --  This node is created during the analysis/resolution of entry calls,
      --  requeues, and subprogram calls. It performs several functions:

      --    * Call markers provide a uniform model for handling calls by the
      --      ABE mechanism, regardless of whether expansion took place.

      --    * The call marker captures the target of the related call along
      --      with other attributes which are either unavailabe or expensive
      --      to recompute once analysis, resolution, and expansion are over.

      --    * The call marker aids the ABE Processing phase by signaling the
      --      presence of a call in case the original call was transformed by
      --      expansion.

      --    * The call marker acts as a reference point for the insertion of
      --      run-time conditional ABE checks or guaranteed ABE failures.

      -- Compound Statement --
      ------------------------

      --  This node is created by the analyzer/expander to handle some
      --  expansion cases where a sequence of actions needs to be captured
      --  within a single node (which acts as a container and allows the
      --  entire list of actions to be moved around as a whole) appearing
      --  in a sequence of statements.

      --  This is the statement counterpart to the expression node
      --  N_Expression_With_Actions.

      --  The required semantics is that the set of actions is executed in
      --  the order in which it appears, as though they appeared by themselves
      --  in the enclosing list of declarations or statements. Unlike what
      --  happens when using an N_Block_Statement, no new scope is introduced.

      --  Note: for the time being, this is used only as a transient
      --  representation during expansion, and all compound statement nodes
      --  must be exploded back to their constituent statements before handing
      --  the tree to the back end.

      --  The N_Expression_With_Actions node represents an expression with
      --  an associated set of actions (which are executable statements and
      --  declarations, as might occur in a handled statement sequence).

      --  The required semantics is that the set of actions is executed in
      --  the order in which it appears just before the expression is
      --  evaluated (and these actions must only be executed if the value
      --  of the expression is evaluated). The node is considered to be
      --  a subexpression, whose value is the value of the Expression after
      --  executing all the actions.

      --  If the actions contain declarations, then these declarations may
      --  be referenced within the expression.

      --  (AI12-0236-1): In Ada 2022, for a declare_expression, the parser
      --  generates an N_Expression_With_Actions. Declare_expressions have
      --  various restrictions, which we do not enforce on
      --  N_Expression_With_Actions nodes that are generated by the
      --  expander. The two cases can be distinguished by looking at
      --  Comes_From_Source.

      --  ???Perhaps we should change the name of this node to
      --  N_Declare_Expression, and perhaps we should change the Sprint syntax
      --  to match the RM syntax for declare_expression.

      --  Sprint syntax:  do
      --                    action;
      --                    action;
      --                    ...
      --                    action;

      --  Note: In the final generated tree presented to the code generator,
      --  the actions list is always non-null, since there is no point in this
      --  node if the actions are Empty. During semantic analysis there are
      --  cases where it is convenient to temporarily generate an empty actions
      --  list. This arises in cases where we create such an empty actions
      --  list, and it may or may not end up being a place where additional
      --  actions are inserted. The expander removes such empty cases after
      --  the expression of the node is fully analyzed and expanded, at which
      --  point it is safe to remove it, since no more actions can be inserted.

      --  Note: In Modify_Tree_For_C, we never generate any declarations in
      --  the action list, which can contain only non-declarative statements.

      -- Free Statement --
      --------------------

      --  The N_Free_Statement node is generated as a result of a call to an

      -- Freeze Entity --
      -------------------

      --  This node marks the point in a declarative part at which an entity
      --  declared therein becomes frozen. The expander places initialization
      --  procedures for types at those points. Gigi uses the freezing point
      --  to elaborate entities that may depend on previous private types.

      --  See the section in Einfo "Delayed Freezing and Elaboration" for
      --  a full description of the use of this node.

      --  The Entity field points back to the entity for the type (whose
      --  Freeze_Node field points back to this freeze node).

      --  The Actions field contains a list of declarations and statements
      --  generated by the expander which are associated with the freeze
      --  node, and are elaborated as though the freeze node were replaced
      --  by this sequence of actions.

      --  Note: the Sloc field in the freeze node references a construct
      --  associated with the freezing point. This is used for posting
      --  messages in some error/warning situations, e.g. the case where
      --  a primitive operation of a tagged type is declared too late.

      --  Sprint syntax: freeze entity-name [
      --                   freeze actions
      --                 ]

      --  First_Subtype_Link (set to Empty if no link)

      --  The Actions field holds actions associated with the freeze. These
      --  actions are elaborated at the point where the type is frozen.

      --  Note: in the case where a debug source file is generated, the Sloc
      --  for this node points to the FREEZE keyword in the Sprint file output.

      ---------------------------
      -- Freeze Generic Entity --
      ---------------------------

      --  The freeze point of an entity indicates the point at which the
      --  information needed to generate code for the entity is complete.
      --  The freeze node for an entity triggers expander activities, such as
      --  build initialization procedures, and backend activities, such as
      --  completing the elaboration of packages.

      --  For entities declared within a generic unit, for which no code is
      --  generated, the freeze point is not equally meaningful. However, in
      --  Ada 2012 several semantic checks on declarations must be delayed to
      --  the freeze point, and we need to include such a mark in the tree to
      --  trigger these checks. The Freeze_Generic_Entity node plays no other
      --  role, and is ignored by the expander and the back-end.

      --------------------------------
      -- Implicit Label Declaration --
      --------------------------------

      --  An implicit label declaration is created for every occurrence of a
      --  label on a statement or a label on a block or loop. It is chained
      --  in the declarations of the innermost enclosing block as specified
      --  in RM section 5.1 (3).

      --  The Defining_Identifier is the actual identifier for the statement
      --  identifier. Note that the occurrence of the label is a reference, NOT
      --  the defining occurrence. The defining occurrence occurs at the head
      --  of the innermost enclosing block, and is represented by this node.

      --  Note: from the grammar, this might better be called an implicit
      --  statement identifier declaration, but the term we choose seems
      --  friendlier, since at least informally statement identifiers are
      --  called labels in both cases (i.e. when used in labels, and when
      --  used as the identifiers of blocks and loops).

      --  Note: although this is logically a semantic node, since it does not
      --  correspond directly to a source syntax construction, these nodes are
      --  actually created by the parser in a post pass done just after parsing
      --  is complete, before semantic analysis is started (see Par.Labl).

      --  Sprint syntax: labelname : label;

      --  N_Implicit_Label_Declaration
      --  Sloc points to the << token for a statement identifier, or to the
      --    LOOP, DECLARE, or BEGIN token for a loop or block identifier
      --  Defining_Identifier
      --  Label_Construct

      --  Note: in the case where a debug source file is generated, the Sloc
      --  for this node points to the label name in the generated declaration.

      ---------------------
      -- Itype Reference --
      ---------------------

      --  This node is used to create a reference to an Itype. The only purpose
      --  is to make sure the Itype is defined if this is the first reference.

      --  A typical use of this node is when an Itype is to be referenced in
      --  two branches of an IF statement. In this case it is important that
      --  the first use of the Itype not be inside the conditional, since then
      --  it might not be defined if the other branch of the IF is taken, in
      --  the case where the definition generates elaboration code.

      --  The Itype field points to the referenced Itype

      --  Sprint syntax: reference itype-name

      --  N_Itype_Reference
      --  Sloc points to the node generating the reference
      --  Itype

      ---------------------
      -- Raise xxx Error --
      ---------------------

      --  One of these nodes is created during semantic analysis to replace
      --  a node for an expression that is determined to definitely raise
      --  the corresponding exception.

      --  The N_Raise_xxx_Error node may also stand alone in place
      --  of a declaration or statement, in which case it simply causes
      --  the exception to be raised (i.e. it is equivalent to a raise
      --  statement that raises the corresponding exception). This use
      --  is distinguished by the fact that the Etype in this case is
      --  Standard_Void_Type; in the subexpression case, the Etype is the
      --  same as the type of the subexpression which it replaces.

      --  If Condition is empty, then the raise is unconditional. If the
      --  Condition field is non-empty, it is a boolean expression which is
      --  first evaluated, and the exception is raised only if the value of the
      --  expression is True. In the unconditional case, the creation of this
      --  node is usually accompanied by a warning message (unless it appears
      --  within the right operand of a short-circuit form whose left argument
      --  is static and decisively eliminates elaboration of the raise
      --  operation). The condition field can ONLY be present when the node is
      --  used as a statement form; it must NOT be present in the case where
      --  the node appears within an expression.

      --  The exception is generated with a message that contains the
      --  file name and line number, and then appended text. The Reason
      --  code shows the text to be added. The Reason code is an element
      --  of the type Types.RT_Exception_Code, and indicates both the
      --  message to be added, and the exception to be raised (which must
      --  match the node type). The value is stored by storing a Uint which
      --  is the Pos value of the enumeration element in this type.

      --  Gigi restriction: This expander ensures that the type of the
      --  Condition field is always Standard.Boolean, even if the type
      --  in the source is some non-standard boolean type.

      --  Sprint syntax: [xxx_error "msg"]
      --             or: [xxx_error when condition "msg"]

      --  N_Raise_Constraint_Error
      --  Sloc references related construct

      ---------------------------------------------
      -- Optimization of Exception Raise to Goto --
      ---------------------------------------------

      --  In some cases, the front end will determine that any exception raised
      --  by the back end for a certain exception should be transformed into a
      --  goto statement.

      --  There are three kinds of exceptions raised by the back end (note that
      --  for this purpose we consider gigi to be part of the back end in the
      --  gcc case):

      --     1. Exceptions resulting from N_Raise_xxx_Error nodes
      --     2. Exceptions from checks triggered by Do_xxx_Check flags
      --     3. Other cases not specifically marked by the front end

      --  Normally all such exceptions are translated into calls to the proper
      --  Rcheck_xx procedure, where xx encodes both the exception to be raised
      --  and the exception message.

      --  The front end may determine that for a particular sequence of code,
      --  exceptions in any of these three categories for a particular builtin
      --  exception should result in a goto, rather than a call to Rcheck_xx.
      --  The exact sequence to be generated is:

      --      Local_Raise (exception'Identity);
      --      goto Label

      --  The front end marks such a sequence of code by bracketing it with
      --  push and pop nodes:

      --       N_Push_xxx_Label (referencing the label)
      --       ...
      --       (code where transformation is expected for exception xxx)
      --       ...
      --       N_Pop_xxx_Label

      --  The use of push/pop reflects the fact that such regions can properly
      --  nest, and one special case is a subregion in which no transformation
      --  is allowed. Such a region is marked by a N_Push_xxx_Label node whose
      --  Exception_Label field is Empty.

      --  N_Push_Constraint_Error_Label
      --  Sloc references first statement in region covered
      --  Exception_Label

      --  N_Push_Program_Error_Label
      --  Sloc references first statement in region covered
      --  Exception_Label

      --  N_Push_Storage_Error_Label

      -- Reference --
      ---------------

      --  For a number of purposes, we need to construct references to objects.
      --  These references are subsequently treated as normal access values.
      --  An example is the construction of the parameter block passed to a
      --  task entry. The N_Reference node is provided for this purpose. It is
      --  similar in effect to the use of the Unrestricted_Access attribute,
      --  and like Unrestricted_Access can be applied to objects which would
      --  not be valid prefixes for the Unchecked_Access attribute (e.g.
      --  objects which are not aliased, and slices). In addition it can be
      --  applied to composite type values as well as objects, including string
      --  values and aggregates.

      --  Note: we use the Prefix field for this expression so that the
      --  resulting node can be treated using common code with the attribute
      --  nodes for the 'Access and related attributes. Logically it would make
      --  more sense to call it an Expression field, but then we would have to
      --  special case the treatment of the N_Reference node.

      --  Note: evaluating a N_Reference node is guaranteed to yield a non-null
      --  value at run time. Therefore, it is valid to set Is_Known_Non_Null on
      --  a temporary initialized to a N_Reference node in order to eliminate
      --  superfluous access checks.

      --  A standard tree-walk will not encounter these nodes even if they

      -- Validate_Unchecked_Conversion --
      -----------------------------------

      --  The front end does most of the validation of unchecked conversion,
      --  including checking sizes (this is done after the back end is called
      --  to take advantage of back-annotation of calculated sizes).

      --  The front end also deals with specific cases that are not allowed
      --  e.g. involving unconstrained array types.

      --  For the case of the standard gigi backend, this means that all
      --  checks are done in the front end.

      --  However, in the case of specialized back-ends, in particular the JVM
      --  backend in the past, additional requirements and restrictions may
      --  apply to unchecked conversion, and these are most conveniently
      --  performed in the specialized back-end.

      --  To accommodate this requirement, for such back ends, the following
      --  special node is generated recording an unchecked conversion that
      --  needs to be validated. The back end should post an appropriate
      --  error message if the unchecked conversion is invalid or warrants
      --  a special warning message.

      --  Source_Type and Target_Type point to the entities for the two
      --  types involved in the unchecked conversion instantiation that
