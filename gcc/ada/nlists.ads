package Nlists is

   --  A node list is a list of nodes in a special format that means that
   --  nodes can be on at most one such list. For each node list, a list
   --  header is allocated in the lists table, and a List_Id value references
   --  this header, which may be used to access the nodes in the list using
   --  the set of routines that define this interface.

   --  Note: node lists can contain either nodes or entities (extended nodes)
   --  or a mixture of nodes and extended nodes.
