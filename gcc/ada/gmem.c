/*  This unit reads the allocation tracking log produced by augmented
    __gnat_malloc and __gnat_free procedures (see file a-raise.c) and
    provides GNATMEM tool with gdb-compliant output. The output is
    processed by GNATMEM to detect dynamic memory allocation errors.

    See GNATMEM section in GNAT User's Guide for more information.

    NOTE: This capability is currently supported on the following targets:

      DEC Unix
      GNU/Linux x86
      Solaris (sparc and x86) (*)
      Windows 98/95/NT (x86)

    (*) on these targets, the compilation must be done with -funwind-tables to
    be able to build the stack backtrace.
