--  This module handles four kinds of inlining activity:

--  a) Instantiation of generic bodies. This is done unconditionally, after
--  analysis and expansion of the main unit.

--  b) Compilation of unit bodies that contain the bodies of inlined sub-
--  programs. This is done only if inlining is enabled (-gnatn). Full inlining
--  requires that a) and b) be mutually recursive, because each step may
--  generate another generic expansion and further inlined calls.

--  c) Front-end inlining for Inline_Always subprograms. This is primarily an
--  expansion activity that is performed for performance reasons, and when the
--  target does not use the GCC back end.

--  d) Front-end inlining for GNATprove, to perform source transformations
--  to simplify formal verification. The machinery used is the same as for
--  Inline_Always subprograms, but there are fewer restrictions on the source
--  of subprograms.

   --          not Always_Inlined, then a warning is issued if the flag
   --          Ineffective_Inline_Warnings is set (adding p?), and if not,
   --          the call has no effect.
   --
   --        * Compiling with optimizations then a warning is issued if the
   --          flag Ineffective_Inline_Warnings is set (adding p?); otherwise
