   --------------------------------------------
   -- General Approach to Library Management --
   --------------------------------------------

   --  As described in GNote #1, when a unit is compiled, all its subsidiary
   --  units are recompiled, including the following:

   --    (a) Corresponding spec for a body
   --    (b) Parent spec of a child library spec
   --    (c) With'ed specs
   --    (d) Parent body of a subunit
   --    (e) Subunits corresponding to any specified stubs
   --    (f) Bodies of inlined subprograms that are called
   --    (g) Bodies of generic subprograms or packages that are instantiated
   --    (h) Bodies of packages containing either of the above two items
   --    (i) Specs and bodies of runtime units
   --    (j) Parent specs for with'ed child library units

   --  If a unit is being compiled only for syntax checking, then no subsidiary
   --  units are loaded, the syntax check applies only to the main unit,
   --  i.e. the one contained in the source submitted to the library.

   --  If a unit is being compiled for syntax and semantic checking, then only
   --  cases (a)-(d) loads are performed, since the full semantic checking can
   --  be carried out without needing (e)-(i) loads. In this case no object
   --  file, or library information file, is generated, so the missing units
   --  do not affect the results.

   --  Specifications of library subprograms, subunits, and generic specs
   --  and bodies, can only be compiled in syntax/semantic checking mode,
   --  since no code is ever generated directly for these units. In the case
   --  of subunits, only the compilation of the ultimate parent unit generates
   --  actual code. If a subunit is submitted to the compiler in syntax/
   --  semantic checking mode, the parent (or parents in the nested case) are
   --  semantically checked only up to the point of the corresponding stub.

   --  If code is being generated, then all the above units are required,
   --  although the need for bodies of inlined procedures can be suppressed
   --  by the use of a switch that sets the mode to ignore pragma Inline
   --  statements.

   --  The two main sections of the front end, Par and Sem, are recursive.
   --  Compilation proceeds unit by unit making recursive calls as necessary.
   --  The process is controlled from the GNAT main program, which makes calls
   --  to Par and Sem sequence for the main unit.

   --  Par parses the given unit, and then, after the parse is complete, uses
   --  the Par.Load subprogram to load all its subsidiary units in categories
   --  (a)-(d) above, installing pointers to the loaded units in the parse
   --  tree, as described in a later section of this spec. If any of these
   --  required units is missing, a fatal error is signalled, so that no
   --  attempt is made to run Sem in such cases, since it is assumed that
   --  too many cascaded errors would result, and the confusion would not
   --  be helpful.

   --  Following the call to Par on the main unit, the entire tree of required
   --  units is thus loaded, and Sem is called on the main unit. The parameter
   --  passed to Sem is the unit to be analyzed. The visibility table, which
   --  is a single global structure, starts out containing only the entries
   --  for the visible entities in Standard. Every call to Sem establishes a
   --  new scope stack table, pushing an entry for Standard on entry to provide
   --  the proper initial scope environment.

   --  Sem first proceeds to perform semantic analysis on the currently loaded
   --  units as follows:

   --    In the case of a body (case (a) above), Sem analyzes the corresponding
   --    spec, using a recursive call to Sem. As is always expected to be the
   --    case with calls to Sem, any entities installed in the visibility table
   --    are removed on exit from Sem, so that these entities have to be
   --    reinstalled on return to continue the analysis of the body which of
   --    course needs visibility of these entities.
   --
   --    In the case of the parent of a child spec (case (b) above), a similar
   --    call is made to Sem to analyze the parent. Again, on return, the
   --    entities from the analyzed parent spec have to be installed in the
   --    visibility table of the caller (the child unit), which must have
   --    visibility to the entities in its parent spec.

   --    For with'ed specs (case (c) above), a recursive call to Sem is made
   --    to analyze each spec in turn. After all the spec's have been analyzed,
   --    but not till that point, the entities from all the with'ed units are
   --    reinstalled in the visibility table so that the caller can proceed
   --    with the analysis of the unit doing the with's with the necessary
   --    entities made either potentially use visible or visible by selection
   --    as needed.

   --    Case (d) arises when Sem is passed a subunit to analyze. This means
   --    that the main unit is a subunit, and the unit passed to Sem is either
   --    the main unit, or one of its ancestors that is still a subunit. Since
   --    analysis must start at the top of the tree, Sem essentially cancels
   --    the current call by immediately making a call to analyze the parent
   --    (when this call is finished it immediately returns, so logically this
   --    call is like a goto). The subunit will then be analyzed at the proper
   --    time as described for the stub case. Note that we also turn off the
   --    indication that code should be generated in this case, since the only
   --    time we generate code for subunits is when compiling the main parent.

   --    Case (e), subunits corresponding to stubs, are handled as the stubs
   --    are encountered. There are three sub-cases:

   --      If the subunit has already been loaded, then this means that the
   --      main unit was a subunit, and we are back on our way down to it
   --      after following the initial processing described for case (d).
   --      In this case we analyze this particular subunit, as described
   --      for the case where we are generating code, but when we get back
   --      we are all done, since the rest of the parent is irrelevant. To
   --      get out of the parent, we raise the exception Subunit_Found, which
   --      is handled at the outer level of Sem.

   --      The cases where the subunit has not already been loaded correspond
   --      to cases where the main unit was a parent. In this case the action
   --      depends on whether or not we are generating code. If we are not
   --      generating code, then this is the case where we can simply ignore
   --      the subunit, since in checking mode we don't even want to insist
   --      that the subunit exist, much less waste time checking it.

   --      If we are generating code, then we need to load and analyze
   --      all subunits. This is achieved with a call to Lib.Load to load
   --      and parse the unit, followed by processing that installs the
   --      context clause of the subunit, analyzes the subunit, and then
   --      removes the context clause (from the visibility chains of the
   --      parent). Note that we do *not* do a recursive call to Sem in
   --      this case, precisely because we need to do the analysis of the
   --      subunit with the current visibility table and scope stack.

   --    Case (f) applies only to subprograms for which a pragma Inline is
   --    given, providing that the compiler is operating in the mode where
   --    pragma Inline's are activated. When the expander encounters a call
   --    to such a subprogram, it loads the body of the subprogram if it has
   --    not already been loaded, and calls Sem to process it.

   --    Case (g) is similar to case (f), except that the body of a generic
   --    is unconditionally required, regardless of compiler mode settings.
   --    As in the subprogram case, when the expander encounters a generic
   --    instantiation, it loads the generic body of the subprogram if it
   --    has not already been loaded, and calls Sem to process it.

   --    Case (h) arises when a package contains either an inlined subprogram
   --    which is called, or a generic which is instantiated. In this case the
   --    body of the package must be loaded and analyzed with a call to Sem.

   --    Case (i) is handled by adding implicit with clauses to the context
   --    clauses of all units that potentially reference the relevant runtime
   --    entities. Note that since we have the full set of units available,
   --    the parser can always determine the set of runtime units that is
   --    needed. These with clauses do not have associated use clauses, so
   --    all references to the entities must be by selection. Once the with
   --    clauses have been added, subsequent processing is as for normal
   --    with clauses.

   --    Case (j) is also handled by adding appropriate implicit with clauses
   --    to any unit that withs a child unit. Again there is no use clause,
   --    and subsequent processing proceeds as for an explicit with clause.

   --  Sem thus completes the loading of all required units, except those
   --  required for inline subprogram bodies or inlined generics. If any
   --  of these load attempts fails, then the expander will not be called,
   --  even if code was to be generated. If the load attempts all succeed
   --  then the expander is called, though the attempt to generate code may
   --  still fail if an error occurs during a load attempt for an inlined
   --  body or a generic body.

   -------------------------------------------
   -- Special Handling of Subprogram Bodies --
   -------------------------------------------

   --  A subprogram body (in an adb file) may stand for both a spec and a body.
   --  A simple model (and one that was adopted through version 2.07) is simply
   --  to assume that such an adb file acts as its own spec if no ads file is
   --  is present.

   --  However, this is not correct. RM 10.1.4(4) requires that such a body
   --  act as a spec unless a subprogram declaration of the same name is
   --  already present. The correct interpretation of this in GNAT library
   --  terms is to ignore an existing ads file of the same name unless this
   --  ads file contains a subprogram declaration with the same name.

   --  If there is an ads file with a unit other than a subprogram declaration
   --  with the same name, then a fatal message is output, noting that this
   --  irrelevant file must be deleted before the body can be compiled. See
   --  ACVC test CA1020D to see how this processing is required.

   -----------------
   -- Global Data --
   -----------------

   Current_Sem_Unit : Unit_Number_Type := Main_Unit;
   --  Unit number of unit currently being analyzed/expanded. This is set when
   --  ever a new unit is entered, saving and restoring the old value, so that
   --  it always reflects the unit currently being analyzed. The initial value
   --  of Main_Unit ensures that a proper value is set initially, and in
   --  particular for analysis of configuration pragmas in gnat.adc.

   Main_Unit_Entity : Entity_Id;
   --  Entity of main unit, same as Cunit_Entity (Main_Unit) except where
   --  Main_Unit is a body with a separate spec, in which case it is the
   --  entity for the spec.

   -----------------
   -- Units Table --
   -----------------

   --  The units table has an entry for each unit (source file) read in by the
   --  current compilation. The table is indexed by the unit number value.
   --  The first entry in the table, subscript Main_Unit, is for the main file.
   --  Each entry in this units table contains the following data.

   --    Cunit
   --      Pointer to the N_Compilation_Unit node. Initially set to Empty by
   --      Lib.Load, and then reset to the required node by the parser when
   --      the unit is parsed.

   --    Cunit_Entity
   --      Pointer to the entity node for the compilation unit. Initially set
   --      to Empty by Lib.Load, and then reset to the required entity by the
   --      parser when the unit is parsed.

   --    Dependency_Num
   --      This is the number of the unit within the generated dependency
   --      lines (D lines in the ALI file) which are sorted into alphabetical
   --      order. The number is ones origin, so a value of 2 refers to the
   --      second generated D line. The Dependency_Num values are set as the
   --      D lines are generated, and are used to generate proper unit
   --      references in the generated xref information and SCO output.

   --    Dynamic_Elab
   --      A flag indicating if this unit was compiled with dynamic elaboration
   --      checks specified (as the result of using the -gnatE compilation
   --      option or a pragma Elaboration_Checks (Dynamic)).

   --    Error_Location
   --      This is copied from the Sloc field of the Enode argument passed
   --      to Load_Unit. It refers to the enclosing construct which caused
   --      this unit to be loaded, e.g. most typically the with clause that
   --      referenced the unit, and is used for error handling in Par.Load.

   --    Expected_Unit
   --      This is the expected unit name for a file other than the main unit,
   --      since these are cases where we load the unit using Lib.Load and we
   --      know the unit that is expected. It must be the same as Unit_Name
   --      if it is set (see test in Par.Load). Expected_Unit is set to
   --      No_Name for the main unit.

   --    Fatal_Error
   --      A flag that is initialized to None and gets set to Error if a fatal
   --      error occurs during the processing of a unit. A fatal error is one
   --      defined as serious enough to stop the next phase of the compiler
   --      from running (i.e. fatal error during parsing stops semantics,
   --      fatal error during semantics stops code generation). Note that
   --      currently, errors of any kind cause Fatal_Error to be set, but
   --      eventually perhaps only errors labeled as fatal errors should be
   --      this severe if we decide to try Sem on sources with minor errors.
   --      There are three settings (see declaration of Fatal_Type).

   --    Generate_Code
   --      This flag is set True for all units in the current file for which
   --      code is to be generated. This includes the unit explicitly compiled,
   --      together with its specification, and any subunits.

   --    Has_RACW
   --      A Boolean flag, initially set to False when a unit entry is created,
   --      and set to True if the unit defines a remote access to class wide
   --      (RACW) object. This is used for controlling generation of the RA
   --      attribute in the ali file.

   --    Ident_String
   --      N_String_Literal node from a valid pragma Ident that applies to
   --      this unit. If no Ident pragma applies to the unit, then Empty.

   --    Is_Predefined_Renaming
   --      True if this unit is a predefined renaming, as in "Text_IO renames
   --      Ada.Text_IO").

   --    Is_Internal_Unit
   --      Same as In_Predefined_Unit, except units in the GNAT hierarchy are
   --      included.

   --    Is_Predefined_Unit
   --      True if this unit is predefined (i.e. part of the Ada, System, or
   --      Interface hierarchies, or Is_Predefined_Renaming). Note that units
   --      in the GNAT hierarchy are not considered predefined.

   --    Loading
   --      A flag that is used to catch circular WITH dependencies. It is set
   --      True when an entry is initially created in the file table, and set
   --      False when the load is completed, or ends with an error.

   --    Main_Priority
   --      This field is used to indicate the priority of a possible main
   --      program, as set by a pragma Priority. A value of -1 indicates
   --      that the default priority is to be used (and is also used for
   --      entries that do not correspond to possible main programs).

   --    Main_CPU
   --      This field is used to indicate the affinity of a possible main
   --      program, as set by a pragma CPU. A value of -1 indicates
   --      that the default affinity is to be used (and is also used for
   --      entries that do not correspond to possible main programs).

   --    Munit_Index
   --      The index of the unit within the file for multiple unit per file
   --      mode. Set to zero in normal single unit per file mode.

   --    No_Elab_Code_All
   --      A flag set when a pragma or aspect No_Elaboration_Code_All applies
   --      to the unit. This is used to implement the transitive WITH rules
   --      (and for no other purpose).

   --    OA_Setting
   --      This is a character field containing L if Optimize_Alignment mode
   --      was set locally, and O/T/S for Off/Time/Space default if not.

   --    Primary_Stack_Count
   --      The number of primary stacks belonging to tasks defined within the
   --      unit that have no Storage_Size specified when the either restriction
   --      No_Implicit_Heap_Allocations or No_Implicit_Task_Allocations is
   --      active. Only used by the binder to generate stacks for these tasks
   --      at bind time.

   --    Sec_Stack_Count
   --      The number of secondary stacks belonging to tasks defined within the
   --      unit that have no Secondary_Stack_Size specified when the either
   --      the No_Implicit_Heap_Allocations or No_Implicit_Task_Allocations
   --      restrictions are active. Only used by the binder to generate stacks
   --      for these tasks at bind time.

   --    Serial_Number
   --      This field holds a serial number used by New_Internal_Name to
   --      generate unique temporary numbers on a unit by unit basis. The
   --      only access to this field is via the Increment_Serial_Number
   --      routine which increments the current value and returns it. This
   --      serial number is separate for each unit.

   --    Source_Index
   --      The index in the source file table of the corresponding source file.
   --      Set when the entry is created by a call to Lib.Load and then cannot
   --      be changed.

   --    Unit_File_Name
   --      The name of the source file containing the unit. Set when the entry
   --      is created by a call to Lib.Load, and then cannot be changed.

   --    Unit_Name
   --      The name of the unit. Initialized to No_Name by Lib.Load, and then
   --      set by the parser when the unit is parsed to the unit name actually
   --      found in the file (which should, in the absence of errors) be the
   --      same name as Expected_Unit.

   --    Version
   --      This field holds the version of the unit, which is computed as
   --      the exclusive or of the checksums of this unit, and all its
   --      semantically dependent units. Access to the version number field
   --      is not direct, but is done through the routines described below.
   --      When a unit table entry is created, this field is initialized to
   --      the checksum of the corresponding source file. Version_Update is
   --      then called to reflect the contributions of any unit on which this
   --      unit is semantically dependent.

   --  The units table is reset to empty at the start of the compilation of
   --  each main unit by Lib.Initialize. Entries are then added by calls to
   --  the Lib.Load procedure. The following subprograms are used to access
   --  and modify entries in the Units table. Individual entries are accessed
   --  using a unit number value which ranges from Main_Unit (the first entry,
   --  which is always for the current main unit) to Last_Unit.

   Default_Main_Priority : constant Int := -1;
   --  Value used in Main_Priority field to indicate default main priority

   Default_Main_CPU : constant Int := -1;
   --  Value used in Main_CPU field to indicate default main affinity

   --  The following defines settings for the Fatal_Error field

   type Fatal_Type is (
      None,
      --  No error detected for this unit

      Error_Detected,
      --  Fatal error detected that prevents moving to the next phase. For
      --  example, a fatal error during parsing inhibits semantic analysis.

      Error_Ignored);
      --  A fatal error was detected, but we are in Try_Semantics mode (as set
      --  by -gnatq or -gnatQ). This does not stop the compiler from proceding,
      --  but tools can use this status (e.g. ASIS looking at the generated
      --  tree) to know that a fatal error was detected.

   function Cunit            (U : Unit_Number_Type) return Node_Id;
   function Cunit_Entity     (U : Unit_Number_Type) return Entity_Id;
   function Dependency_Num   (U : Unit_Number_Type) return Nat;

   --  and the unit is not given in a No_Dependence restriction that we
   --  can see, the attribute will return False.

   --  We have to ensure in this case that the binder will reject any attempt
   --  to set a No_Dependence restriction in some other unit in the partition.

   --  If the unit is in the semantic closure, then of course it is properly
   --  WITH'ed by someone, and the binder will do this job automatically as
   --  part of its normal processing.

   --  But if the unit is not in the semantic closure, we must make sure the
   --  binder knows about it. The use of the Restriction_Set attribute giving
   --  a result of False does not mean of itself that we have to include the
   --  unit in the partition. So what we do is to generate a with (W) line in
   --  the ali file (with no file name information), but no corresponding D
   --  (dependency) line. This is recognized by the binder as meaning "Don't
   --  let anyone specify No_Dependence for this unit, but you don't have to
   --  include it if there is no real W line for the unit".

   --  The following table keeps track of relevant units. It is used in the
   --  Lib.Writ circuit for outputting With lines to output the special with
   --  line with RA if the unit is not in the semantic closure.
