   -- Checksum Control --
   ----------------------

   --  Checksums are computed for sources to check for sources being the same
   --  from a compilation point of view (e.g. spelling of identifiers and
   --  white space layout do not count in this computation).

   --  The way the checksum is computed has evolved across the various versions
   --  of GNAT. When gprbuild is called with -m, the checksums must be computed
   --  the same way in gprbuild as it was in the GNAT version of the compiler.
   --  The different ways are

   --    Version 6.4 and later:

   --      The Accumulate_Token_Checksum procedure is called after each numeric
   --      literal and each identifier/keyword. For keywords, Tok_Identifier is
   --      used in the call to Accumulate_Token_Checksum.

   --    Versions 5.04 to 6.3:

   --      For keywords, the token value were used in the call to procedure
   --      Accumulate_Token_Checksum. Type Token_Type did not include Tok_Some.

   --    Versions 5.03:

   --      For keywords, the token value were used in the call to
   --      Accumulate_Token_Checksum. Type Token_Type did not include
   --      Tok_Interface, Tok_Overriding, Tok_Synchronized and Tok_Some.

   --    Versions 5.02 and before:

   --      No calls to procedure Accumulate_Token_Checksum (the checksum
   --      mechanism was introduced in version 5.03).

   --  To signal to the scanner whether Accumulate_Token_Checksum needs to be
   --  called and what versions to call, the following Boolean flags are used:

   Checksum_Accumulate_Token_Checksum : Boolean := True;
   --  GPRBUILD
   --  Set to False by gprbuild when the version of GNAT is 5.02 or before. If
   --  this switch is False, then we do not call Accumulate_Token_Checksum, so
   --  the setting of the following two flags is irrelevant.

   Checksum_GNAT_6_3 : Boolean := False;
   --  GPRBUILD
   --  Set to True by gprbuild when the version of GNAT is 6.3 or before.

   Checksum_GNAT_5_03 : Boolean := False;
   --  GPRBUILD
   --  Set to True by gprbuild when the version of GNAT is 5.03 or before.

   Checksum_Accumulate_Limited_Checksum : Boolean := False;
   --  Used to control the computation of the limited view of a package.
   --  (Not currently used, possible optimization for ALI files of units
   --  in limited with_clauses).

   -- Settings of Modes for Current Processing --
   ----------------------------------------------

   --  The following mode values represent the current state of processing.
   --  The values set here are the default values. Unless otherwise noted,
   --  the value may be reset in Switch-? with an appropriate switch. In
   --  some cases, the values can also be modified by pragmas, and in the
   --  case of some binder variables, Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg may modify
   --  the default values.

   Latest_Ada_Only : Boolean := False;
   --  If True, the only value valid for Ada_Version is Ada_Version_Type'Last,
   --  trying to specify other values will be ignored (in case of pragma
   --  Ada_xxx) or generate an error (in case of -gnat83/95/xx switches).

   type Ada_Version_Type is (Ada_83, Ada_95, Ada_2005, Ada_2012, Ada_2020);
   pragma Ordered (Ada_Version_Type);
   --  Versions of Ada for Ada_Version below. Note that these are ordered,
   --  so that tests like Ada_Version >= Ada_95 are legitimate and useful.
   --  Think twice before using "="; Ada_Version >= Ada_2012 is more likely
   --  what you want, because it will apply to future versions of the language.

   Ada_Version_Default : constant Ada_Version_Type := Ada_2012;
   pragma Warnings (Off, Ada_Version_Default);
   --  GNAT
   --  Default Ada version if no switch given. The Warnings off is to kill
   --  constant condition warnings.

   Ada_Version : Ada_Version_Type := Ada_Version_Default;
   --  GNAT
   --  Current Ada version for compiler, as set by configuration pragmas,
   --  compiler switches, or implicitly (to Ada_Version_Runtime) when a
   --  predefined or internal file is compiled.

   Ada_Version_Pragma : Node_Id := Empty;
   --  Reflects the Ada_xxx pragma that resulted in setting Ada_Version. Used
   --  to specialize error messages complaining about the Ada version in use.

   Ada_Version_Explicit : Ada_Version_Type := Ada_Version_Default;
   --  GNAT
   --  Like Ada_Version, but does not get set implicitly for predefined or
   --  internal units, so it reflects the Ada version explicitly set using
   --  configuration pragmas or compiler switches (or if neither appears, it
   --  remains set to Ada_Version_Default). This is used in the rare cases
   --  (notably pragma Obsolescent) where we want the explicit version set.

   Ada_Version_Runtime : Ada_Version_Type := Ada_2012;
   --  GNAT
   --  Ada version used to compile the runtime. Used to set Ada_Version (but
   --  not Ada_Version_Explicit) when compiling predefined or internal units.

   Ada_Final_Suffix : constant String := "final";
   Ada_Final_Name   : String_Ptr := new String'("ada" & Ada_Final_Suffix);
   --  GNATBIND
   --  The name of the procedure that performs the finalization at the end of

   Ada_Init_Name   : String_Ptr := new String'("ada" & Ada_Init_Suffix);
   --  GNATBIND
   --  The name of the procedure that performs initialization at the start
   --  of execution. This variable may be modified by Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg.

   Ada_Main_Name_Suffix : constant String := "main";
   --  GNATBIND
   --  The suffix for Ada_Main_Name. Defined as a constant here so that it
   --  can be referenced in a uniform manner to create either the default
   --  value of Ada_Main_Name (declared below), or the non-default name
   --  set by Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg.

   Ada_Main_Name : String_Ptr := new String'("ada_" & Ada_Main_Name_Suffix);
   --  GNATBIND
   --  The name of the Ada package generated by the binder (when in Ada mode).
   --  This variable may be modified by Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg.

   Address_Clause_Overlay_Warnings : Boolean := True;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set False to disable address clause warnings. Modified by use of
   --  -gnatwo/O.

   Address_Is_Private : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT, GNATBIND
   --  Set True if package System has the line "type Address is private;"

   All_Errors_Mode : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Flag set to force display of multiple errors on a single line and
   --  also repeated error messages for references to undefined identifiers
   --  and certain other repeated error messages. Set by use of -gnatf.

   Allow_Integer_Address : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Allow use of integer expression in a context requiring System.Address.
   --  Set by the use of configuration pragma Allow_Integer_Address Also set
   --  in relaxed semantics mode for use by CodePeer or when -gnatd.M is used.

   All_Sources : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  Set to True to require all source files to be present. This flag is
   --  directly modified by gnatmake to affect the shared binder routines.

   Alternate_Main_Name : String_Ptr := null;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  Set to non-null when Bind_Alternate_Main_Name is True. This value
   --  is modified as needed by Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg.

   ASIS_GNSA_Mode : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Enable GNSA back-end processing assuming ASIS_Mode is already set to
   --  True. ASIS_GNSA mode suppresses the call to gigi.

   ASIS_Mode : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Enable semantic checks and tree transformations that are important
   --  for ASIS but that are usually skipped if Operating_Mode is set to
   --  Check_Semantics. This flag does not have the corresponding option to set
   --  it ON. It is set ON when Tree_Output is set ON, it can also be set ON
   --  from the code of GNSA-based tool (a client may need to set ON the
   --  Back_Annotate_Rep_Info flag in this case. At the moment this does not
   --  make very much sense, because GNSA cannot do back annotation).

   Assertions_Enabled : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Indicates default policy (True = Check, False = Ignore) to be applied
   --  to all assertion aspects and pragmas, and to pragma Debug, if there is
   --  no overriding Assertion_Policy, Check_Policy, or Debug_Policy pragma.
   --  Set True by use of -gnata.

   Assume_No_Invalid_Values : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT Normally, in accordance with (RM 13.9.1 (9-11)) the front end
   --  assumes that values could have invalid representations, unless it can
   --  clearly prove that the values are valid. If this switch is set (by
   --  pragma Assume_No_Invalid_Values (On)), then the compiler assumes values
   --  are valid and in range of their representations. This feature is now
   --  fully enabled in the compiler.

   Back_Annotate_Rep_Info : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  If set True, enables back annotation of representation information
   --  by gigi, even in -gnatc mode. This is set True by the use of -gnatR
   --  (list representation information) or -gnatt (generate tree). It is
   --  also set true if certain Unchecked_Conversion instantiations require
   --  checking based on annotated values.

   Back_End_Handles_Limited_Types : Boolean;
   --  This flag is set true if the back end can properly handle limited or
   --  other by reference types, and avoid copies. If this flag is False, then
   --  the front end does special expansion for if/case expressions to make
   --  sure that no copy occurs. If the flag is True, then the expansion for
   --  if and case expressions relies on the back end properly handling things.
   --  Currently the default is False for all cases (set in gnat1drv). The
   --  default can be modified using -gnatd.L (sets the flag True). This is
   --  used to test the possibility of having the backend handle this.

   Back_End_Inlining : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set True to activate inlining by back-end expansion. This is the normal
   --  default mode for gcc targets, so it is True on such targets unless the
   --  switches -gnatN or -gnatd.z are used. See circuitry in gnat1drv for the
   --  exact conditions for setting this switch.

   Bind_Alternate_Main_Name : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  True if main should be called Alternate_Main_Name.all.
   --  This variable may be set to True by Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg.

   --  GNATBIND
   --  Set to False if not binding main Ada program

   Bind_For_Library : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  Set to True if the binder needs to generate a file designed for building
   --  a library. May be set to True by Gnatbind.Scan_Bind_Arg.

   Bind_Only : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATMAKE, GPRBUILD
   --  Set to True to skip compile and link steps
   --  (except when Compile_Only and/or Link_Only are True).

   Blank_Deleted_Lines : Boolean := False;

   --  Set to True to build, bind and link all the sources of a project file
   --  (switch -B)

   Check_Aliasing_Of_Parameters : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True to detect whether subprogram parameters and function results
   --  alias the same object(s).

   Check_Float_Overflow : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True to check that operations on predefined unconstrained float
   --  types (e.g. Float, Long_Float) do not overflow and generate infinities
   --  or invalid values. Set by the Check_Float_Overflow pragma, or by use
   --  of the -gnateF switch.

   Check_Object_Consistency : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATBIND, GNATMAKE
   --  Set to True to check whether every object file is consistent with its
   --  corresponding ada library information (ALI) file. An object file is
   --  inconsistent with the corresponding ALI file if the object file does
   --  not exist or if it has an older time stamp than the ALI file. Default
   --  above is for GNATBIND. GNATMAKE overrides this default to True (see
   --  Make.Initialize) since we normally do need to check source consistencies
   --  in gnatmake.

   Check_Only : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  Set to True to do checks only, no output of binder file

   Check_Policy_List : Node_Id := Empty;
   --  GNAT
   --  This points to the list of N_Pragma nodes for Check_Policy pragmas
   --  that are linked through the Next_Pragma fields, with the list being
   --  terminated by Empty. The order is most recently processed first. Note
   --  that Push_Scope and Pop_Scope in Sem_Ch8 save and restore the value
   --  of this variable, implementing the required scope control for pragmas
   --  appearing in a declarative part.

   Check_Readonly_Files : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATMAKE
   --  Set to True to check readonly files during the make process

   Check_Source_Files : Boolean := True;
   --  GNATBIND, GNATMAKE
   --  Set to True to enable consistency checking for any source files that
   --  are present (i.e. date must match the date in the library info file).

   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True to check for unreferenced formals. This is turned on by
   --  -gnatwa/wf/wu and turned off by -gnatwA/wF/wU.

   Check_Validity_Of_Parameters : Boolean := False;

   --  Set True by an occurrence of pragma Compiler_Unit_Warning (or of the
   --  obsolete pragma Compiler_Unit) in the main unit. Once set True, stays
   --  True, since any units that are with'ed directly or indirectly by
   --  a Compiler_Unit_Warning main unit are subject to the same restrictions.
   --  Such units really should have their own pragmas, but we do not bother to

   -- Configuration Settings --
   ----------------------------

   --  line switches, or by the use of appropriate configuration pragmas in a
   --  configuration pragma file (but NOT by a local use of a configuration
   --  pragma in a single file).

   Ada_Version_Config : Ada_Version_Type;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch for the Ada 83 mode, as
   --  set by the command line switches -gnat83/95/2005/2012, and possibly

   --  This will be set nonempty if it is set by a configuration pragma

   Ada_Version_Explicit_Config : Ada_Version_Type;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is set in the same manner as Ada_Version_Config. The difference is
   --  that the setting of this flag is not ignored for internal and predefined
   --  units, which for some purposes do indeed access this value, regardless
   --  of the fact that they are compiled the most up to date ada version).

   Assertions_Enabled_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch for assertions enabled
   --  mode, as possibly set by the command line switch -gnata, and possibly

   --  pragma. A value of ' ' means that no pragma was given, otherwise the

   --  This is the flag that indicates whether extensions are allowed. It can
   --  be set True either by use of the -gnatX switch, or by use of the

   --  for internal GNAT units, since extensions are always permitted in such
   --  units.

   External_Name_Exp_Casing_Config : External_Casing_Type;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls casing of
   --  external symbols for which an explicit external name is given. It can be
   --  set to Uppercase by the command line switch -gnatF, and further modified
   --  by the use of the configuration pragma External_Name_Casing in the
   --  gnat.adc file. This flag is used to set the initial value for
   --  External_Name_Exp_Casing at the start of analyzing each unit. Note
   --  however that the setting of this flag is ignored for internal and
   --  predefined units (which are always compiled with As_Is mode).

   External_Name_Imp_Casing_Config : External_Casing_Type;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls casing of
   --  external symbols where the external name is implicitly given. It can be
   --  set to Uppercase by the command line switch -gnatF, and further modified
   --  by the use of the configuration pragma External_Name_Casing in the
   --  gnat.adc file. This flag is used to set the initial value for

   Initialize_Scalars_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that is set by the
   --  pragma Initialize_Scalars when it appears in the gnat.adc file.
   --  This switch is not set when the pragma appears ahead of a given
   --  unit, so it does not affect the compilation of other units.

   No_Component_Reordering_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that is set by the
   --  pragma No_Component_Reordering when it appears in the gnat.adc file.
   --  This flag is used to set the initial value of No_Component_Reordering
   --  at the start of each compilation unit, except that it is always set
   --  False for predefined units.

   No_Exit_Message : Boolean := False;

   --  failures, the builder does not issue an exit error message.

   Optimize_Alignment_Config : Character;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls the
   --  alignment optimization mode, as set by an Optimize_Alignment pragma.
   --  It is used to set the initial value of Optimize_Alignment at the start
   --  of each new compilation unit, except that it is always set to 'O' (off)
   --  for internal units.

   Persistent_BSS_Mode_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls whether
   --  potentially persistent data is to be placed in the persistent_bss
   --  section. It can be set True by use of the pragma Persistent_BSS.
   --  This flag is used to set the initial value of Persistent_BSS_Mode
   --  at the start of each compilation unit, except that it is always
   --  set False for predefined units.

   Polling_Required_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls polling
   --  mode. It can be set True by the command line switch -gnatP, and then
   --  further modified by the use of pragma Polling in the gnat.adc file. This
   --  flag is used to set the initial value for Polling_Required at the start
   --  of analyzing each unit.

   Prefix_Exception_Messages_Config : Boolean;
   --  The setting of Prefix_Exception_Messages from configuration pragmas

   Use_VADS_Size_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT

   --  affects the way the switches are set (see above). Main_Unit is true if
   --  switches are being set for the main unit or for the spec of the main

   --  settings.

   ------------------------
   -- Other Global Flags --
   ------------------------

   Building_Static_Dispatch_Tables : Boolean := True;
   --  This flag indicates if the backend supports generation of statically
   --  allocated dispatch tables. If it is True, then the front end will
   --  generate static aggregates for dispatch tables that contain forward
   --  references to addresses of subprograms not seen yet, and the back end
   --  must be prepared to handle this case. If it is False, then the front
   --  end generates assignments to initialize the dispatch table, and there
   --  are no such forward references. By default we build statically allocated
   --  dispatch tables for all library level tagged types in all platforms.This
   --  behavior can be disabled using switch -gnatd.t which will set this flag
   --  to False and revert to the previous dynamic behavior.

   Expander_Active : Boolean := False;
   --  A flag that indicates if expansion is active (True) or deactivated
   --  (False). When expansion is deactivated all calls to expander routines
   --  have no effect. Note that the initial setting of False is merely to
   --  prevent saving of an undefined value for an initial call to the
   --  Expander_Mode_Save_And_Set procedure. For more information on the use of
   --  this flag, see package Expander. Indeed this flag might more logically
