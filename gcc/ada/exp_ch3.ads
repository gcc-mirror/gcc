   --  Builds a call to the initialization procedure for the base type of Typ,

   --  appropriate for the type (the _Master, for task types, for example).
   --  N is the construct for which the call is to be built. In_Init_Proc has
   --  to be set to True when the call is itself in an init proc in order to

   --
   --  Enclos_Type is the enclosing type when initializing a component of a
   --  composite type, and is used for the case where Typ is a task type of
   --  an array component: the indices of this enclosing type are then used
   --  to build the image string that identifies each task at run time.
   --
   --  Target_Ref is also used when Typ is a task type if the initialization
   --  call is to be generated for an allocator. It is either the name of a
   --  simple assignment whose expression is the allocator, or the defining
   --  identifier of an object declaration whose initializing expression is
   --  the allocator, or else the allocator's access type. It is used both
   --  to build the image string and to pass the task master.
   --
   --  Discr_Map is used to replace discriminants by their discriminals in
   --  expressions used to constrain record components. In the presence of
   --  entry families bounded by discriminants, protected type discriminants
   --  can appear within expressions in array bounds (not as stand-alone
   --  identifiers) and a general replacement is necessary.
   --
   --  Ada 2005 (AI-287): With_Default_Init is used to indicate that the
   --  initialization call corresponds to a default initialized component
   --  of an aggregate.
   --

   --  used only to support C++ constructors.
   --
   --  Init_Control_Actual is Empty except in the case where the init proc
   --  for a tagged type calls the init proc for its parent type in order
   --  to initialize its _Parent component. In that case, it is the
   --  actual parameter value corresponding to the Init_Control formal
   --  parameter to be used in the call of the parent type's init proc.

   --  This function executes the freezing actions associated with the given

   --  Exp_SPARK.SPARK_Freeze_Type. They need to be kept in sync.

   --  whose source location is used in the construction of the expression.
   --  Size is used as follows:
   --
   --    * If the size of the object to be initialized it is known, it should
   --      be passed to the routine.
   --
   --    * If the size is unknown or is zero, then the Esize of Typ is used as
   --      an estimate of the size.
   --
   --  The object size is needed to prepare a known invalid value for use by
   --  Normalize_Scalars. A call to this routine where Typ denotes a scalar
   --  type is valid only when Normalize_Scalars or Initialize_Scalars is

   --  the dispatch tables of Typ is appended to Stmts_List. If Fixed_Comps is

   --  variable positions of Target are initialized.

   --  The initialization routine for a tagged type is passed in a
   --  formal parameter of this type, indicating what initialization
   --  is to be performed. This parameter defaults to Full_Init in all
   --  cases except when the init proc of a type extension (let's call
   --  that type T2) calls the init proc of its parent (let's call that
   --  type T1). In that case, one of the other 3 values will
   --  be passed in. In all three of those cases, the Tag component has
   --  already been initialized before the call and is therefore not to be
   --  modified. T2's init proc will either call T1's init proc
   --  once (with Full_Init_Except_Tag as the parameter value) or twice
   --  (first with Early_Init_Only, then later with Late_Init_Only),
   --  depending on the result returned by Has_Late_Init_Component (T1).
   --  In the latter case, the first call does not initialize any
   --  components that require late initialization and the second call
   --  then performs that deferred initialization.
   --  Strictly speaking, the formal parameter subtype is actually Natural
   --  but calls will only pass in values corresponding to literals
   --  of this enumeration type.
