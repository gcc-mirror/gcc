   procedure Expand_N_Full_Type_Declaration      (N : Node_Id);

   procedure Expand_Previous_Access_Type (Def_Id : Entity_Id);
   --  For a full type declaration that contains tasks, or that is a task,
   --  check whether there exists an access type whose designated type is an
   --  incomplete declarations for the current composite type. If so, build the
   --  master for that access type, now that it is known to denote an object
   --  with tasks.

   procedure Expand_Record_Extension (T : Entity_Id; Def : Node_Id);
   --  Add a field _parent in the extension part of the record

   procedure Build_Access_Subprogram_Wrapper_Body
     (Decl     : Node_Id;
      New_Decl : Node_Id);
   --  Build the wrapper body, which holds the indirect call through an access-
   --  to-subprogram, and whose expansion incorporates the contracts of the
   --  access type declaration. Called from Build_Access_Subprogram_Wrapper.
   --  Building the wrapper is done during analysis to perform proper semantic
   --  checks on the relevant aspects. The wrapper body could be simplified to
   --  a null body when expansion is disabled ???

   procedure Build_Or_Copy_Discr_Checking_Funcs (N : Node_Id);
   --  For each variant component, builds a function that checks whether
   --  the component name is consistent with the current discriminants
   --  and sets the component's Dcheck_Function attribute to refer to it.
   --  N is the full type declaration node; the discriminant checking
   --  functions are inserted after this node.
   --  In the case of a derived untagged type, copy the attributes that were
   --  set for the components of the parent type onto the components of the
   --  derived type; no new subprograms are constructed in this case.

   function Build_Initialization_Call
     (Loc                 : Source_Ptr;

   --  Builds a call to the initialization procedure for the base type of Typ,
   --  passing it the object denoted by Id_Ref, plus additional parameters as
   --  appropriate for the type (the _Master, for task types, for example).
   --  Loc is the source location for the constructed tree. In_Init_Proc has
   --  to be set to True when the call is itself in an init proc in order to
   --  enable the use of discriminals. Enclos_Type is the enclosing type when
   --  initializing a component in an outer init proc, and it is used for
   --  various expansion cases including the case where Typ is a task type
   --  which is an array component, the indexes of the enclosing type are
   --  used to build the string that identifies each task at runtime.
   --
   --  Discr_Map is used to replace discriminants by their discriminals in
   --  expressions used to constrain record components. In the presence of
   --  entry families bounded by discriminants, protected type discriminants
   --  can appear within expressions in array bounds (not as stand-alone
   --  identifiers) and a general replacement is necessary.
   --
   --  Ada 2005 (AI-287): With_Default_Init is used to indicate that the
   --  initialization call corresponds to a default initialized component
   --  of an aggregate.
   --
   --  Constructor_Ref is a call to a constructor subprogram. It is currently
   --  used only to support C++ constructors.
   --
   --  Init_Control_Actual is Empty except in the case where the init proc
   --  for a tagged type calls the init proc for its parent type in order
   --  to initialize its _Parent component. In that case, it is the
   --  actual parameter value corresponding to the Init_Control formal
   --  parameter to be used in the call of the parent type's init proc.

   --  record Typ with the given parameters specification list.

   function Freeze_Type (N : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  This function executes the freezing actions associated with the given
   --  freeze type node N and returns True if the node is to be deleted. We
   --  delete the node if it is present just for front end purpose and we don't
   --  want Gigi to see the node. This function can't delete the node itself
   --  since it would confuse any remaining processing of the freeze node.
   --
   --  Note: for GNATprove we have a minimal variant of this routine in
   --  Exp_SPARK.SPARK_Freeze_Type. They need to be kept in sync.

   --  Build an expression that represents the required initial value of type
   --  Typ for which predicate Needs_Simple_Initialization is True. N is a node
   --  whose source location is used in the construction of the expression.
   --  Size is used as follows:
   --
   --    * If the size of the object to be initialized it is known, it should
   --      be passed to the routine.
   --
   --    * If the size is unknown or is zero, then the Esize of Typ is used as
   --      an estimate of the size.
   --
   --  The object size is needed to prepare a known invalid value for use by
   --  Normalize_Scalars. A call to this routine where Typ denotes a scalar
   --  type is valid only when Normalize_Scalars or Initialize_Scalars is
   --  active, or if N is the node for a 'Invalid_Value attribute node.

   function Init_Proc_Level_Formal (Proc : Entity_Id) return Entity_Id;
   --  Fetch the extra formal from an initalization procedure "proc"
   --  corresponding to the level of the object being initialized. When none
   --  is present Empty is returned.

   --  of Typ. The generated code referencing tag fields of Target is appended
   --  to Init_Tags_List and the code required to complete the elaboration of
   --  the dispatch tables of Typ is appended to Stmts_List. If Fixed_Comps is
   --  True then the tag components located at fixed positions of Target are
   --  initialized; if Variable_Comps is True then tags components located at
   --  variable positions of Target are initialized.

   procedure Make_Controlling_Function_Wrappers

      Decl_List : out List_Id;

   --  Ada 2005 (AI-391): Makes specs and bodies for the wrapper functions
   --  associated with inherited functions with controlling results which
   --  are not overridden. The body of each wrapper function consists solely
   --  of a return statement whose expression is an extension aggregate
   --  invoking the inherited subprogram's parent subprogram and extended
   --  with a null association list.

     (Tag_Typ     : Entity_Id;
      Predef_List : List_Id;

   --  Creates spec for the predefined equality on a tagged type Tag_Typ, if
   --  required. If created, it will be appended to Predef_List.
   --
   --  The Parameter Renamed_Eq either returns the value Empty, or else
   --  the defining unit name for the predefined equality function in the
   --  case where the type has a primitive operation that is a renaming
   --  of predefined equality (but only if there is also an overriding
   --  user-defined equality function). The returned Renamed_Eq will be

   --  requires a separate reassignment of the tag of the given type, because
   --  the expression may include an unchecked conversion. This tag assignment
   --  is inserted after the declaration, but if the object has an address
   --  clause the assignment is handled as part of the freezing of the object,
   --  see Check_Address_Clause.
