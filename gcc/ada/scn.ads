   procedure Initialize_Scanner
     (Unit  : Unit_Number_Type;
      Index : Source_File_Index);
   --  Initialize lexical scanner for scanning a new file. The caller has
   --  completed the construction of the Units.Table entry for the specified
   --  Unit and Index references the corresponding source file. A special case
   --  is when Unit = No_Unit, and Index corresponds to the source index for
   --  reading the configuration pragma file.

   function Determine_Token_Casing return Casing_Type;
   --  Determines the casing style of the current token, which is either a
   --  keyword or an identifier. See also package Casing.

   procedure Post_Scan;
   --  Create nodes for tokens: Char_Literal, Identifier, Real_Literal,
   --  Integer_Literal, String_Literal and Operator_Symbol.

   procedure Scan_Reserved_Identifier (Force_Msg : Boolean);
   --  This procedure is called to convert the current token, which the caller
   --  has checked is for a reserved word, to an equivalent identifier. This is
   --  of course only used in error situations where the parser can detect that
   --  a reserved word is being used as an identifier. An appropriate error
   --  message, pointing to the token, is also issued if either this is the
   --  first occurrence of misuse of this identifier, or if Force_Msg is True.
