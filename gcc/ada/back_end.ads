   --  outputting code. This call is made with all tables locked. The back

   procedure Scan_Compiler_Arguments;
   --  Acquires command-line parameters passed to the compiler and processes
   --  them. Calls Scan_Front_End_Switches for any front-end switches found.

   --  The processing of arguments is private to the back end, since the way
   --  of acquiring the arguments as well as the set of allowable back end
   --  switches is different depending on the particular back end being used.

   --  the assembler afterwards), but is needed for back-ends that directly
   --  generate the final object file so that the object file's timestamp is
   --  correct when compared with the corresponding ali file by gnatmake.
