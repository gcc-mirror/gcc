--  This package contains the generic functions which are instantiated with
--  predefined integer and real types to generate the runtime exponentiation
--  functions called by expanded code generated by Expand_Op_Expon. This
--  version of the package contains routines that are compiled with overflow
--  checks enabled, so they are called for exponentiation operations which
--  require overflow checking

package System.Exp_Gen is
pragma Pure (System.Exp_Gen);

   --  Exponentiation for float types (checks on)

      type Type_Of_Base is digits <>;
