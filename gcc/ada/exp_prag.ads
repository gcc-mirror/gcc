   procedure Expand_Pragma_Always_Terminates (Prag : Node_Id);
   --  This routine only exists for consistency with other pragmas, since
   --  Always_Terminates has no meaningful expansion.

   --  Given pragma Contract_Cases CCs, create the circuitry needed to evaluate
   --  case guards and trigger consequence expressions. Subp_Id is the related
   --  subprogram for which the pragma applies. Decls are the declarations of
   --  Subp_Id's body. All generated code is added to list Stmts. If Stmts is
   --  No_List on entry, a new list is created.

   procedure Expand_Pragma_Exceptional_Cases (Prag : Node_Id);
   --  Given pragma Exceptional_Cases Prag, create the circuitry needed to
   --  catch exceptions and evaluate consequence expressions.

   procedure Expand_Pragma_Exit_Cases (Prag : Node_Id);
   --  Given pragma Exit_Cases Prag, create the circuitry needed to evaluate
   --  case guards and check the exit kind (exception raised or normal return).

   procedure Expand_Pragma_Initial_Condition
     (Pack_Id : Entity_Id;
      N       : Node_Id);
   --  Verify the run-time semantics of pragma Initial_Condition when it
   --  applies to package Pack_Id. N denotes the related package spec or
   --  body.

      Subp_Id    : Entity_Id;

   --  Given pragma Subprogram_Variant Prag, create the circuitry needed
   --  to evaluate variant expressions at the subprogram entry and at the
   --  recursive call. Subp_Id is the related subprogram for which the pragma
   --  applies and Body_Decls are its body declarations. On exit, the argument
   --  of Prag is replaced with a reference to procedure with checks for the
   --  variant expressions.

   procedure Expand_Pragma_Program_Exit (Prag : Node_Id);
   --  This routine only exists for consistency with other pragmas, since
   --  Program_Exit has no meaningful expansion.
