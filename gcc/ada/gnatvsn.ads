--  This package spec exports version information for GNAT, GNATBIND and
--  GNATMAKE.

package Gnatvsn is

   function Gnat_Version_String return String;
   --  Version output when GNAT (compiler), or its related tools, including
   --  GNATBIND, GNATCHOP, GNATFIND, GNATLINK, GNATMAKE, GNATXREF, are run
   --  (with appropriate verbose option switch set).

   Gnat_Static_Version_String : constant String := "GNU Ada";
   --  Static string identifying this version, that can be used as an argument
   --  to e.g. pragma Ident.

   type Gnat_Build_Type is (FSF, Public, GAP);
   --  See Get_Gnat_Build_Type below for the meaning of these values.

   function Get_Gnat_Build_Type return Gnat_Build_Type;
   --  This function returns one of the following values of Gnat_Build_Type:
   --
   --    FSF
   --       GNAT FSF version. This version of GNAT is part of a Free Software
   --       Foundation release of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The binder
   --       will not output informational messages regarding intended use,
   --       and the bug box generated by Comperr will give information on
   --       how to report bugs and list the "no warranty" information.
   --
   --    Public
   --       GNAT Public version.
   --       The binder will output informational messages, and the bug box
   --       generated by the package Comperr will give appropriate bug
   --       submission instructions.
   --
   --    GAP
   --       GNAT Academic Program, similar to Public.

   Ver_Len_Max : constant := 32;
   --  Longest possible length for Gnat_Version_String in this or any
   --  other version of GNAT. This is used by the binder to establish
   --  space to store any possible version string value for checks. This
   --  value should never be decreased in the future, but it would be
   --  OK to increase it if absolutely necessary.

   Library_Version : constant String := "4.0";
   --  Library version. This value must be updated whenever any change to the
   --  compiler affects the library formats in such a way as to obsolete
   --  previously compiled library modules.
   --
   --  Note: Makefile.in relies on the precise format of the library version
   --  string in order to correctly construct the soname value.

   Verbose_Library_Version : constant String := "GNAT Lib v" & Library_Version;
   --  Version string stored in e.g. ALI files.

   ASIS_Version_Number : constant := 4;
   --  ASIS Version. This is used to check for consistency between the compiler
   --  used to generate trees, and an ASIS application that is reading the
   --  trees. It must be updated (incremented) whenever a change is made to
   --  the tree format that would result in a compiler being incompatible with
   --  an older version of ASIS, or vice versa.
