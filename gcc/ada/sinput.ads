--  This package contains the input routines used for reading the
--  input source file. The actual I/O routines are in OS_Interface,
--  with this module containing only the system independent processing.

--  General Note: throughout the compiler, we use the term line or source
--  line to refer to a physical line in the source, terminated by the end of
--  physical line sequence.

--  There are two distinct concepts of line terminator in GNAT

--    A logical line terminator is what corresponds to the "end of a line" as
--    described in RM 2.2 (13). Any of the characters FF, LF, CR or VT or any
--    wide character that is a Line or Paragraph Separator acts as an end of
--    logical line in this sense, and it is essentially irrelevant whether one
--    or more appears in sequence (since if a sequence of such characters is
--    regarded as separate ends of line, then the intervening logical lines
--    are null in any case).

--    A physical line terminator is a sequence of format effectors that is
--    treated as ending a physical line. Physical lines have no Ada semantic
--    significance, but they are significant for error reporting purposes,
--    since errors are identified by line and column location.

--  In GNAT, a physical line is ended by any of the sequences LF, CR/LF, or
--  CR. LF is used in typical Unix systems, CR/LF in DOS systems, and CR
--  alone in System 7. In addition, we recognize any of these sequences in
--  any of the operating systems, for better behavior in treating foreign
--  files (e.g. a Unix file with LF terminators transferred to a DOS system).
--  Finally, wide character codes in categories Separator, Line and Separator,
--  Paragraph are considered to be physical line terminators.

   --  is known.

   type License_Type is
     (Unknown,
      --  Licensing status of this source unit is unknown

      Restricted,

      GPL,
      --  This file is licensed under the unmodified GPL. It is not allowed
      --  to depend on Non_GPL units, and Non_GPL units may not depend on
      --  this source unit.

      Modified_GPL,
      --  This file is licensed under the GNAT modified GPL (see header of
      --  This file for wording of the modification). It may depend on other
      --  Modified_GPL units or on unrestricted units.

      Unrestricted);
      --  The license on this file is permitted to depend on any other
      --  units, or have other units depend on it, without violating the
      --  license of this unit. Examples are public domain units, and
      --  units defined in the RM).

   --  The above license status is checked when the appropriate check is
   --  activated and one source depends on another, and the licensing state
   --  of both files is known:

   --  The prohibited combinations are:

   --    Restricted file may not depend on GPL file

   --    GPL file may not depend on Restricted file

   --    Modified GPL file may not depend on Restricted file
   --    Modified_GPL file may not depend on GPL file

   --  The reason for the last restriction here is that a client depending
   --  on a modified GPL file must be sure that the license condition is
   --  correct considered transitively.

   --  The licensing status is determined either by the presence of a
   --  specific pragma License, or by scanning the header for a predefined
   --  statement, or any file if compiling in -gnatg mode.

   -----------------------
   -- Source File Table --
   -----------------------

   --  The source file table has an entry for each source file read in for
   --  this run of the compiler. This table is (default) initialized when
   --  the compiler is loaded, and simply accumulates entries as compilation
   --  proceeds and various routines in Sinput and its child packages are
   --  called to load required source files.

   --  Virtual entries are also created for generic templates when they are
   --  instantiated, as described in a separate section later on.

   --  In the case where there are multiple main units (e.g. in the case of
   --  the cross-reference tool), this table is not reset between these units,
   --  so that a given source file is only read once if it is used by two
   --  separate main units.

   --  The entries in the table are accessed using a Source_File_Index that
   --  ranges from 1 to Last_Source_File. Each entry has the following fields.

   --  Note: fields marked read-only are set by Sinput or one of its child
   --  packages when a source file table entry is created, and cannot be
   --  subsequently modified, or alternatively are set only by very special
   --  circumstances, documented in the comments.

   --  File_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name of the source file (simple name with no directory information)

   --  Full_File_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Full file name (full name with directory info), used for generation
   --    of error messages, etc.

   --  File_Type : Type_Of_File (read-only)
   --    Indicates type of file (source file, configuration pragmas file,
   --    preprocessor definition file, preprocessor input file).

   --  Reference_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in error messages where
   --    only the simple name of the file is required. Identical to File_Name
   --    unless pragma Source_Reference is used to change it. Only processing
   --    for the Source_Reference pragma circuit may set this field.

   --  Full_Ref_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in error messages where
   --    the full name of the file is required. Identical to Full_File_Name
   --    unless pragma Source_Reference is used to change it. Only processing
   --    for the Source_Reference pragma may set this field.

   --  Debug_Source_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in debugging information
   --    where only the simple name of the file is required. Identical to
   --    Reference_Name unless the -gnatD (debug source file) switch is used.
   --    Only processing in Sprint that generates this file is permitted to
   --    set this field.

   --  Full_Debug_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in debugging information
   --    where the full name of the file is required. This is identical to
   --    Full_Ref_Name unless the -gnatD (debug source file) switch is used.
   --    Only processing in Sprint that generates this file is permitted to
   --    set this field.

   --  Instance : Instance_Id (read-only)
   --    For entries corresponding to a generic instantiation, unique
   --    identifier denoting the full chain of nested instantiations. Set to
   --    No_Instance_Id for the case of a normal, non-instantiation entry.
   --    See below for details on the handling of generic instantiations.

   --  License : License_Type;
   --    License status of source file

   --  Num_SRef_Pragmas : Nat;
   --    Number of source reference pragmas present in source file

   --  First_Mapped_Line : Logical_Line_Number;
   --    This field stores logical line number of the first line in the
   --    file that is not a Source_Reference pragma. If no source reference
   --    pragmas are used, then the value is set to No_Line_Number.

   --  Source_Text : Source_Buffer_Ptr (read-only)
   --    Text of source file. Every source file has a distinct set of
   --    nonoverlapping bounds, so it is possible to determine which
   --    file is referenced from a given subscript (Source_Ptr) value.

   --  Source_First : Source_Ptr; (read-only)
   --    This is always equal to Source_Text'First, except during
   --    construction of a debug output file (*.dg), when Source_Text = null,
   --    and Source_First is the size so far. Likewise for Last.

   --  Source_Last : Source_Ptr; (read-only)
   --    Same idea as Source_Last, but for Last

   --  Time_Stamp : Time_Stamp_Type; (read-only)
   --    Time stamp of the source file

   --  Source_Checksum : Word;
   --    Computed checksum for contents of source file. See separate section
   --    later on in this spec for a description of the checksum algorithm.

   --  Last_Source_Line : Physical_Line_Number;
   --    Physical line number of last source line. While a file is being
   --    read, this refers to the last line scanned. Once a file has been
   --    completely scanned, it is the number of the last line in the file,
   --    and hence also gives the number of source lines in the file.

   --  Keyword_Casing : Casing_Type;
   --    Casing style used in file for keyword casing. This is initialized
   --    to Unknown, and then set from the first occurrence of a keyword.
   --    This value is used only for formatting of error messages.

   --  Identifier_Casing : Casing_Type;
   --    Casing style used in file for identifier casing. This is initialized
   --    to Unknown, and then set from an identifier in the program as soon as
   --    one is found whose casing is sufficiently clear to make a decision.
   --    This value is used for formatting of error messages, and also is used
   --    in the detection of keywords misused as identifiers.

   --  Inlined_Call : Source_Ptr;
   --    Source file location of the subprogram call if this source file entry
   --    represents an inlined body or an inherited pragma. Set to No_Location
   --    otherwise. This field is read-only for clients.

   --  Inlined_Body : Boolean;
   --    This can only be set True if Instantiation has a value other than
   --    No_Location. If true it indicates that the instantiation is actually
   --    an instance of an inlined body.

   --  Inherited_Pragma : Boolean;
   --    This can only be set True if Instantiation has a value other than
   --    No_Location. If true it indicates that the instantiation is actually
   --    an inherited class-wide pre- or postcondition.

   --  Template : Source_File_Index; (read-only)
   --    Source file index of the source file containing the template if this
   --    is a generic instantiation. Set to No_Source_File for the normal case
   --    of a non-instantiation entry. See Sinput-L for details.

   --  Unit : Unit_Number_Type;
   --    Identifies the unit contained in this source file. Set by
   --    Initialize_Scanner, must not be subsequently altered.

   --  The source file table is accessed by clients using the following
   --  subprogram interface:

   subtype SFI is Source_File_Index;

   System_Source_File_Index : SFI;
   --  The file system.ads is always read by the compiler to determine the
   --  settings of the target parameters in the private part of System. This
   --  variable records the source file index of system.ads. Typically this
   --  will be 1 since system.ads is read first.

   -----------------------
   -- Checksum Handling --
   -----------------------

   --  As a source file is scanned, a checksum is computed by taking all the
   --  non-blank characters in the file, excluding comment characters, the
   --  minus-minus sequence starting a comment, and all control characters
   --  except ESC.

   --  The checksum algorithm used is the standard CRC-32 algorithm, as
   --  implemented by System.CRC32, except that we do not bother with the
   --  final XOR with all 1 bits.

   --  This algorithm ensures that the checksum includes all semantically
   --  significant aspects of the program represented by the source file,
   --  but is insensitive to layout, presence or contents of comments, wide
   --  character representation method, or casing conventions outside strings.

   --  Scans.Checksum is initialized appropriately at the start of scanning
   --  a file, and copied into the Source_Checksum field of the file table
   --  entry when the end of file is encountered.

   -------------------------------------
   -- Handling Generic Instantiations --
   -------------------------------------

   --  As described in Sem_Ch12, a generic instantiation involves making a
   --  copy of the tree of the generic template. The source locations in
   --  this tree directly reference the source of the template. However, it
   --  is also possible to find the location of the instantiation.

   --  This is achieved as follows. When an instantiation occurs, a new entry
   --  is made in the source file table. The Source_Text of the instantiation
   --  points to the same Source_Buffer as the Source_Text of the template, but
   --  with different bounds. The separate range of Sloc values avoids
   --  confusion, and means that the Sloc values can still be used to uniquely
   --  identify the source file table entry. See Set_Dope below for the
   --  low-level trickery that allows two different pointers to point at the
   --  same array, but with different bounds.

   --  The Instantiation_Id field of this source file index entry, set
   --  to No_Instance_Id for normal entries, instead contains a value that
   --  uniquely identifies a particular instantiation, and the associated
   --  entry in the Instances table. The source location of the instantiation
   --  can be retrieved using function Instantiation below. In the case of
   --  nested instantiations, the Instances table can be used to trace the
   --  complete chain of nested instantiations.

   --  Two routines are used to build the special instance entries in the
   --  source file table. Create_Instantiation_Source is first called to build
   --  the virtual source table entry for the instantiation, and then the
   --  Sloc values in the copy are adjusted using Adjust_Instantiation_Sloc.
   --  See child unit Sinput.L for details on these two routines.

   generic
      with procedure Process (Id : Instance_Id; Inst_Sloc : Source_Ptr);
   procedure Iterate_On_Instances;
   --  Execute Process for each entry in the instance table

   function Instantiation (S : SFI) return Source_Ptr;
   --  For a source file entry that represents an inlined body, source location
   --  of the inlined call. For a source file entry that represents an
   --  inherited pragma, source location of the declaration to which the
   --  overriding subprogram for the inherited pragma is attached. Otherwise,
   --  for a source file entry that represents a generic instantiation, source
   --  location of the instantiation. Returns No_Location in all other cases.

   -----------------
   -- Global Data --
   -----------------

   Current_Source_File : Source_File_Index := No_Source_File;
   --  Source_File table index of source file currently being scanned.
   --  Initialized so that some tools (such as gprbuild) can be built with
   --  -gnatVa and pragma Initialize_Scalars without problems.

   Current_Source_Unit : Unit_Number_Type;
   --  Unit number of source file currently being scanned. The special value
   --  of No_Unit indicates that the configuration pragma file is currently
   --  being scanned (this has no entry in the unit table).

   Source_gnat_adc : Source_File_Index := No_Source_File;
   --  This is set if a gnat.adc file is present to reference this file

   Source : Source_Buffer_Ptr;
   --  Current source (copy of Source_File.Table (Current_Source_Unit).Source)

   -----------------------------------------
   -- Handling of Source Line Terminators --
   -----------------------------------------

   --  In this section we discuss in detail the issue of terminators used to
   --  terminate source lines. The RM says that one or more format effectors
   --  (other than horizontal tab) end a source line, and defines the set of
   --  such format effectors, but does not talk about exactly how they are
   --  represented in the source program (since in general the RM is not in
   --  the business of specifying source program formats).

   --  The type Types.Line_Terminator is defined as a subtype of Character
   --  that includes CR/LF/VT/FF. The most common line enders in practice
   --  are CR (some MAC systems), LF (Unix systems), and CR/LF (DOS/Windows
   --  systems). Any of these sequences is recognized as ending a physical
   --  source line, and if multiple such terminators appear (e.g. LF/LF),
   --  then we consider we have an extra blank line.

   --  VT and FF are recognized as terminating source lines, but they are
   --  considered to end a logical line instead of a physical line, so that
   --  the line numbering ignores such terminators. The use of VT and FF is
   --  mandated by the standard, and correctly handled in a conforming manner
   --  by GNAT, but their use is not recommended.

   --  In addition to the set of characters defined by the type in Types, in
   --  wide character encoding, then the codes returning True for a call to
   --  System.UTF_32.Is_UTF_32_Line_Terminator are also recognized as ending a
   --  source line. This includes the standard codes defined above in addition
   --  to NEL (NEXT LINE), LINE SEPARATOR and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR. Again, as in
   --  the case of VT and FF, the standard requires we recognize these as line
   --  terminators, but we consider them to be logical line terminators. The
   --  only physical line terminators recognized are the standard ones (CR,
   --  LF, or CR/LF).

   --  However, we do not recognize the NEL (16#85#) character as having the
   --  significance of an end of line character when operating in normal 8-bit
   --  Latin-n input mode for the compiler. Instead the rule in this mode is
   --  that all upper half control codes (16#80# .. 16#9F#) are illegal if they
   --  occur in program text, and are ignored if they appear in comments.

   --  First, note that this behavior is fully conforming with the standard.
   --  The standard has nothing whatever to say about source representation
   --  and implementations are completely free to make there own rules. In
   --  this case, in 8-bit mode, GNAT decides that the 16#0085# character is
   --  not a representation of the NEL character, even though it looks like it.
   --  If you have NEL's in your program, which you expect to be treated as
   --  end of line characters, you must use a wide character encoding such as
   --  UTF-8 for this code to be recognized.

   --  Second, an explanation of why we take this slightly surprising choice.
   --  We have never encountered anyone actually using the NEL character to
   --  end lines. One user raised the issue as a result of some experiments,
   --  but no one has ever submitted a program encoded this way, in any of
   --  the possible encodings. It seems that even when using wide character
   --  codes extensively, the normal approach is to use standard line enders
   --  (LF or CR/LF). So the failure to recognize NEL in this mode seems to
   --  have no practical downside.

   --  Moreover, what we have seen in a significant number of programs from
   --  multiple sources is the practice of writing all program text in lower
   --  half (ASCII) form, but using UTF-8 encoded wide characters freely in
   --  comments, where the comments are terminated by normal line endings
   --  (LF or CR/LF). The comments do not contain NEL codes, but they can and
   --  do contain other UTF-8 encoding sequences where one of the bytes is the
   --  NEL code. Now such programs can of course be compiled in UTF-8 mode,
   --  but in practice they also compile fine in standard 8-bit mode without
   --  specifying a character encoding. Since this is common practice, it would
   --  be a significant upwards incompatibility to recognize NEL in 8-bit mode.

   --  distinguish physical and logical line endings. A physical line ending
   --  is one of:
   --
   --     CR on its own (MAC System 7)
   --     LF on its own (Unix and unix-like systems)
   --     CR/LF (DOS, Windows)
   --     Wide character in Separator,Line or Separator,Paragraph category
   --
   --     Note: we no longer recognize LF/CR (which we did in some earlier
   --     versions of GNAT. The reason for this is that this sequence is not
   --     used and recognizing it generated confusion. For example given the
   --     sequence LF/CR/LF we were interpreting that as (LF/CR) ending the
   --     first line and a blank line ending with CR following, but it is
   --     clearly better to interpret this as LF, with a blank line terminated
   --     by CR/LF, given that LF and CR/LF are both in common use, but no
   --     system we know of uses LF/CR.
   --
   --  A logical line ending (that is not a physical line ending) is one of:
   --
   --     VT on its own
   --     FF on its own
   --
   --  On return, P is bumped past the line ending sequence (one of the above
   --  seven possibilities). Physical is set to True to indicate that a
   --  physical end of line was encountered, in which case this routine also
   --  makes sure that the lines table for the current source file has an
   --  appropriate entry for the start of the new physical line.

   procedure Sloc_Range (N : Node_Id; Min, Max : out Source_Ptr);

   --  because parentheses at the outer level do not have a recorded Sloc.
   --
   --  Note: At each step of the tree traversal, we make sure to go back to
   --  the Original_Node, since this function is concerned about original
   --  (source) locations.
   --
   --  Note: if the tree for the expression contains no "real" Sloc values,
   --  i.e. values > No_Location, then both Min and Max are set to
   --  Sloc (Original_Node (N)).

   function Source_Offset (S : Source_Ptr) return Nat;

   --  Writes out a string of the form fff:nn:cc, where fff, nn, cc are the

   --  <no location> and <standard location>. If the location is within an
   --  instantiation, then the instance location is appended, enclosed in
   --  square brackets (which can nest if necessary). Note that this routine
   --  is used only for internal compiler debugging output purposes (which
   --  is why the somewhat cryptic use of brackets is acceptable).

   procedure wl (P : Source_Ptr);
   pragma Export (Ada, wl);
