--  This is the OpenVMS version.
--  Blank line intentional so that it lines up exactly with default.

--  This package defines some system dependent parameters for GNAT. These
--  are values that are referenced by the runtime library and are therefore
--  relevant to the target machine.

--  The parameters whose value is defined in the spec are not generally
--  expected to be changed. If they are changed, it will be necessary to
--  recompile the run-time library.

--  The parameters which are defined by functions can be changed by modifying
--  the body of System.Parameters in file s-parame.adb. A change to this body
--  requires only rebinding and relinking of the application.

--  Note: do not introduce any pragma Inline statements into this unit, since
--  otherwise the relinking and rebinding capability would be deactivated.

package System.Parameters is
pragma Pure (Parameters);

   -- Task And Stack Allocation Control --
   ---------------------------------------

   type Task_Storage_Size is new Integer;
   --  Type used in tasking units for task storage size

   type Size_Type is new Task_Storage_Size;
   --  Type used to provide task storage size to runtime

   Unspecified_Size : constant Size_Type := Size_Type'First;
   --  Value used to indicate that no size type is set

   subtype Ratio is Size_Type range -1 .. 100;
   Dynamic : constant Size_Type := -1;
   --  The secondary stack ratio is a constant between 0 and 100 which
   --  determines the percentage of the allocated task stack that is
   --  used by the secondary stack (the rest being the primary stack).
   --  The special value of minus one indicates that the secondary
   --  stack is to be allocated from the heap instead.

   Sec_Stack_Ratio : constant Ratio := Dynamic;
   --  This constant defines the handling of the secondary stack

   Sec_Stack_Dynamic : constant Boolean := Sec_Stack_Ratio = Dynamic;
   --  Convenient Boolean for testing for dynamic secondary stack

   function Default_Stack_Size return Size_Type;
   --  Default task stack size used if none is specified

   function Minimum_Stack_Size return Size_Type;
   --  Minimum task stack size permitted

   function Adjust_Storage_Size (Size : Size_Type) return Size_Type;
   --  Given the storage size stored in the TCB, return the Storage_Size
   --  value required by the RM for the Storage_Size attribute. The
   --  required adjustment is as follows:
   --
   --    when Size = Unspecified_Size, return Default_Stack_Size
   --    when Size < Minimum_Stack_Size, return Minimum_Stack_Size
   --    otherwise return given Size

   Stack_Grows_Down  : constant Boolean := True;
   --  This constant indicates whether the stack grows up (False) or
   --  down (True) in memory as functions are called. It is used for
   --  proper implementation of the stack overflow check.

   ----------------------------------------------
   -- Characteristics of types in Interfaces.C --
   ----------------------------------------------

   long_bits : constant := 32;
   --  Number of bits in type long and unsigned_long. The normal convention
   --  is that this is the same as type Long_Integer, but this is not true
   --  of all targets. For example, in OpenVMS long /= Long_Integer.

   -- Behavior of Pragma Finalize_Storage_Only --
   ----------------------------------------------

   --  Garbage_Collected is a Boolean constant whose value indicates the
   --  effect of the pragma Finalize_Storage_Entry on a controlled type.

   --    Garbage_Collected = False

   --      The system releases all storage on program termination only,
   --      but not other garbage collection occurs, so finalization calls
   --      are ommitted only for outer level onjects can be omitted if
   --      pragma Finalize_Storage_Only is used.

   --    Garbage_Collected = True

   --      The system provides full garbage collection, so it is never
   --      necessary to release storage for controlled objects for which
   --      a pragma Finalize_Storage_Only is used.

   Garbage_Collected : constant Boolean := False;
   --  The storage mode for this system (release on program exit)

end System.Parameters;
