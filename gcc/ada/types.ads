--  This package contains host independent type definitions which are used
--  in more than one unit in the compiler. They are gathered here for easy
--  reference, although in some cases the full description is found in the
--  relevant module which implements the definition. The main reason that they
--  are not in their "natural" specs is that this would cause a lot of inter-
--  spec dependencies, and in particular some awkward circular dependencies
--  would have to be dealt with.

--  WARNING: There is a C version of this package. Any changes to this source
--  file must be properly reflected in the C header file types.h

--  Note: the declarations in this package reflect an expectation that the host
--  machine has an efficient integer base type with a range at least 32 bits
--  2s-complement. If there are any machines for which this is not a correct
--  assumption, a significant number of changes will be required.

   -- 8-Bit Character and String Types --
   --------------------------------------

   --  We use Standard.Character and Standard.String freely, since we are
   --  compiling ourselves, and we properly implement the required 8-bit
   --  character code as required in Ada 95. This section defines a few
   --  general use constants and subtypes.

   EOF : constant Character := ASCII.SUB;
   --  The character SUB (16#1A#) is used in DOS and other systems derived
   --  from DOS (XP, NT etc) to signal the end of a text file. Internally
   --  all source files are ended by an EOF character, even on Unix systems.
   --  An EOF character acts as the end of file only as the last character
   --  of a source buffer, in any other position, it is treated as a blank
   --  if it appears between tokens, and as an illegal character otherwise.
   --  This makes life easier dealing with files that originated from DOS,
   --  including concatenated files with interspersed EOF characters.

   subtype Graphic_Character is Character range ' ' .. '~';
   --  Graphic characters, as defined in ARM

   subtype Line_Terminator is Character range ASCII.LF .. ASCII.CR;
   --  Line terminator characters (LF, VT, FF, CR). For further details, see
   --  the extensive discussion of line termination in the Sinput spec.

   subtype Upper_Half_Character is
     Character range Character'Val (16#80#) .. Character'Val (16#FF#);
   --  8-bit Characters with the upper bit set

   type Character_Ptr    is access all Character;
   type String_Ptr       is access all String;
   type String_Ptr_Const is access constant String;
   --  Standard character and string pointers

   procedure Free is new Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation (String, String_Ptr);
   --  Procedure for freeing dynamically allocated String values

   subtype Big_String is String (Positive);
   type Big_String_Ptr is access all Big_String;
   --  Virtual type for handling imported big strings. Note that we should
   --  never have any allocators for this type, but we don't give a storage
   --  size of zero, since there are legitimate deallocations going on.

   function To_Big_String_Ptr is
     new Ada.Unchecked_Conversion (System.Address, Big_String_Ptr);
   --  Used to obtain Big_String_Ptr values from external addresses

   subtype Word_Hex_String is String (1 .. 8);

   --  letters for the alphabetic cases.

   function Get_Hex_String (W : Word) return Word_Hex_String;
   --  Convert word value to 8-character hex string

   -----------------------------------------
   -- Types Used for Text Buffer Handling --
   -----------------------------------------

   --  We cannot use type String for text buffers, since we must use the
   --  standard 32-bit integer as an index value, since we count on all index
   --  values being the same size.

   type Text_Ptr is new Int;
   --  Type used for subscripts in text buffer

   type Text_Buffer is array (Text_Ptr range <>) of Character;
   --  Text buffer used to hold source file or library information file

   type Text_Buffer_Ptr is access all Text_Buffer;
   --  Text buffers for input files are allocated dynamically and this type
   --  is used to reference these text buffers.

   procedure Free is
     new Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation (Text_Buffer, Text_Buffer_Ptr);
   --  Procedure for freeing dynamically allocated text buffers

   ------------------------------------------
   -- Types Used for Source Input Handling --
   ------------------------------------------

   type Logical_Line_Number is range 0 .. Int'Last;
   for Logical_Line_Number'Size use 32;
   --  Line number type, used for storing logical line numbers (i.e. line
   --  numbers that include effects of any Source_Reference pragmas in the
   --  source file). The value zero indicates a line containing a source
   --  reference pragma.

   No_Line_Number : constant Logical_Line_Number := 0;
   --  Special value used to indicate no line number

   type Physical_Line_Number is range 1 .. Int'Last;

   --  Line number type, used for storing physical line numbers (i.e. line
   --  numbers in the physical file being compiled, unaffected by the presence
   --  of source reference pragmas).

   type Column_Number is range 0 .. 32767;
   for Column_Number'Size use 16;
   --  Column number (assume that 2**15 - 1 is large enough). The range for
   --  this type is used to compute Hostparm.Max_Line_Length. See also the
   --  processing for -gnatyM in Stylesw).

   No_Column_Number : constant Column_Number := 0;
   --  Special value used to indicate no column number

   Source_Align : constant := 2 ** 12;
   --  Alignment requirement for source buffers (by keeping source buffers
   --  aligned, we can optimize the implementation of Get_Source_File_Index.
   --  See this routine in Sinput for details.

   subtype Source_Buffer is Text_Buffer;
   --  Type used to store text of a source file. The buffer for the main
   --  source (the source specified on the command line) has a lower bound
   --  starting at zero. Subsequent subsidiary sources have lower bounds
   --  which are one greater than the previous upper bound, rounded up to
   --  a multiple of Source_Align.

   type Source_Buffer_Ptr_Var is access all Source_Buffer;
   type Source_Buffer_Ptr is access constant Source_Buffer;
   --  Pointer to source buffer. Source_Buffer_Ptr_Var is used for allocation
   --  and deallocation; Source_Buffer_Ptr is used for all other uses of source
   --  buffers.

   --  True if X = null

   function Source_Buffer_Ptr_Equal (X, Y : Source_Buffer_Ptr) return Boolean
     renames "=";

   --  Do not call this elsewhere.

   function "=" (X, Y : Source_Buffer_Ptr) return Boolean is abstract;
   --  Make "=" abstract. Note that this makes "/=" abstract as well. This is a
   --  vestige of the zero-origin array indexing we used to use, where "=" is
   --  always wrong (including the one in Null_Source_Buffer_Ptr). We keep this
   --  just because we never need to compare Source_Buffer_Ptrs other than to
   --  null.

   subtype Source_Ptr is Text_Ptr;
   --  Type used to represent a source location, which is a subscript of a
   --  character in the source buffer. As noted above, different source buffers
   --  have different ranges, so it is possible to tell from a Source_Ptr value
   --  which source it refers to. Note that negative numbers are allowed to
   --  accommodate the following special values.

   type Source_Span is record

   --  with a First and Last location, such that Ptr in First .. Last

   function To_Span (Loc : Source_Ptr) return Source_Span is ((others => Loc));
   function To_Span (Ptr, First, Last : Source_Ptr) return Source_Span is
     ((Ptr, First, Last));

   No_Location : constant Source_Ptr := -1;
   --  Value used to indicate no source position set in a node. A test for a
   --  Source_Ptr value being > No_Location is the approved way to test for a
   --  standard value that does not include No_Location or any of the following
   --  special definitions. One important use of No_Location is to label
   --  generated nodes that we don't want the debugger to see in normal mode
   --  (very often we conditionalize so that we set No_Location in normal mode
   --  and the corresponding source line in -gnatD mode).

   function No (Loc : Source_Ptr) return Boolean is (Loc = No_Location);
   function Present (Loc : Source_Ptr) return Boolean is (not No (Loc));
   --  Tests for No_Location / not No_Location

   Standard_Location : constant Source_Ptr := -2;
   --  Used for all nodes in the representation of package Standard other than
   --  nodes representing the contents of Standard.ASCII. Note that testing for
   --  a value being <= Standard_Location tests for both Standard_Location and
   --  for Standard_ASCII_Location.

   Standard_ASCII_Location : constant Source_Ptr := -3;
   --  Used for all nodes in the presentation of package Standard.ASCII

   System_Location : constant Source_Ptr := -4;
   --  Used to identify locations of pragmas scanned by Targparm, where we know
   --  the location is in System, but we don't know exactly what line.

   First_Source_Ptr : constant Source_Ptr := 0;

   -- Range Definitions for Tree Data --
   -------------------------------------

   --  The tree has fields that can hold any of the following types:

   --    Pointers to other tree nodes (type Node_Id)
   --    List pointers (type List_Id)
   --    Element list pointers (type Elist_Id)
   --    Names (type Name_Id)
   --    Strings (type String_Id)
   --    Universal integers (type Uint)
   --    Universal reals (type Ureal)

   --  These types are represented as integer indices into various tables.
   --  However, they should be treated as private, except in a few documented
   --  cases. In particular it is usually inappropriate to perform arithmetic
   --  operations using these types. One exception is in computing hash
   --  functions of these types.

   --  In most contexts, the strongly typed interface determines which of these
   --  types is present. However, there are some situations (involving untyped
   --  traversals of the tree), where it is convenient to be easily able to
   --  distinguish these values. The underlying representation in all cases is
   --  an integer type Union_Id, and we ensure that the range of the various
   --  possible values for each of the above types is disjoint (except that
   --  List_Id and Node_Id overlap at Empty) so that this distinction is
   --  possible.

   --  Note: it is also helpful for debugging purposes to make these ranges
   --  distinct. If a bug leads to misidentification of a value, then it will
   --  typically result in an out of range value and a Constraint_Error.

   --  The range of Node_Id is most of the nonnegative integers. The other
   --  ranges are negative. Uint has a very large range, because a substantial
   --  part of this range is used to store direct values; see Uintp for
   --  details. The other types have 100 million values, which should be
   --  plenty.

   type Union_Id is new Int;
   --  The type in the tree for a union of possible ID values

   --  Following are the Low and High bounds of the various ranges.

   List_Low_Bound : constant := -099_999_999;
   --  The List_Id values are subscripts into an array of list headers which
   --  has List_Low_Bound as its lower bound.

   List_High_Bound : constant := 0;
   --  Maximum List_Id subscript value. The ranges of List_Id and Node_Id
   --  overlap by one element (with value zero), which is used both for the
   --  Empty node, and for No_List. The fact that the same value is used is
   --  convenient because it means that the default value of Empty applies to
   --  both nodes and lists, and also is more efficient to test for.

   Node_Low_Bound : constant := 0;
   --  The tree Id values start at zero, because we use zero for Empty (to
   --  allow a zero test for Empty).

   Elmt_Low_Bound : constant := -299_999_999;
   --  Low bound of element Id values. The use of these values is internal to
   --  the Elists package, but the definition of the range is included here
   --  since it must be disjoint from other Id values. The Elmt_Id values are
   --  subscripts into an array of list elements which has this as lower bound.

   Elmt_High_Bound : constant := -200_000_000;

   Uint_High_Bound : constant := -600_000_000;

   --  The following subtype definitions are used to provide convenient names
   --  for membership tests on Int values to see what data type range they
   --  lie in. Such tests appear only in the lowest level packages.

   subtype List_Range      is Union_Id

   -- Types for Atree Package --
   -----------------------------

   --  Node_Id values are used to identify nodes in the tree. They are

   --  the special values Empty and Error are subscripts into this table.
   --  See package Atree for further details.

   type Node_Id is range Node_Low_Bound .. Node_High_Bound with Size => 32;
   --  Type used to identify nodes in the tree

   subtype Entity_Id is Node_Id;
   --  A synonym for node types, used in the Einfo package to refer to nodes
   --  that are entities (i.e. nodes with an Nkind of N_Defining_xxx). All such
   --  nodes are extended nodes and these are the only extended nodes, so that
   --  in practice entity and extended nodes are synonymous.
   --
   --  Note that Sinfo.Nodes.N_Entity_Id is the same as Entity_Id, except it
   --  has a predicate requiring the correct Nkind. Opt_N_Entity_Id is the same
   --  as N_Entity_Id, except it allows Empty. (Sinfo.Nodes is generated by the
   --  Gen_IL program.)

   subtype Node_Or_Entity_Id is Node_Id;
   --  A synonym for node types, used in cases where a given value may be used
   --  to represent either a node or an entity. We like to minimize such uses
   --  for obvious reasons of logical type consistency, but where such uses
   --  occur, they should be documented by use of this type.

   Empty : constant Node_Id := Node_Low_Bound;
   --  Used to indicate null node. A node is actually allocated with this
   --  Id value, so that Nkind (Empty) = N_Empty. Note that Node_Low_Bound
   --  is zero, so Empty = No_List = zero.

   Empty_List_Or_Node : constant := 0;
   --  This constant is used in situations (e.g. initializing empty fields)
   --  where the value set will be used to represent either an empty node or
   --  a non-existent list, depending on the context.

   Error : constant Node_Id := Node_Low_Bound + 1;
   --  Used to indicate an error in the source program. A node is actually
   --  allocated with this Id value, so that Nkind (Error) = N_Error.

   Empty_Or_Error : constant Node_Id := Error;
   --  Since Empty and Error are the first two Node_Id values, the test for
   --  N <= Empty_Or_Error tests to see if N is Empty or Error. This definition
   --  provides convenient self-documentation for such tests.

   First_Node_Id  : constant Node_Id := Node_Low_Bound;
   --  Subscript of first allocated node. Note that Empty and Error are both
   --  allocated nodes, whose Nkind fields can be accessed without error.

   ------------------------------
   -- Types for Nlists Package --
   ------------------------------

   --  List_Id values are used to identify node lists stored in the tree, so
   --  that each node can be on at most one such list (see package Nlists for
   --  further details). Note that the special value Error_List is a subscript

   --  attempt to apply list operations to No_List will cause a (detected)
   --  error.

   type List_Id is range List_Low_Bound .. List_High_Bound with Size => 32;
   --  Type used to identify a node list

   No_List : constant List_Id := List_High_Bound;
   --  Used to indicate absence of a list. Note that the value is zero, which
   --  is the same as Empty, which is helpful in initializing nodes where a
   --  value of zero can represent either an empty node or an empty list.

   Error_List : constant List_Id := List_Low_Bound;
   --  Used to indicate that there was an error in the source program in a
   --  context which would normally require a list. This node appears to be
   --  an empty list to the list operations (a null list is actually allocated
   --  which has this Id value).

   --  Subscript of first allocated list header

   ------------------------------
   -- Types for Elists Package --
   ------------------------------

   No_Elist : constant Elist_Id := Elist_Low_Bound;
   --  Used to indicate absence of an element list. Note that this is not an

   --  valid.

   First_Elist_Id : constant Elist_Id := No_Elist + 1;
   --  Subscript of first allocated Elist header

   --  Element Id values are used to identify individual elements of an element

   type String_Id is range Strings_Low_Bound .. Strings_High_Bound
     with Size => 32;
   --  Type used to identify entries in the strings table

   No_String : constant String_Id := Strings_Low_Bound;
   --  Used to indicate missing string Id. Note that the value zero is used
   --  to indicate a missing data value for all the Int types in this section.

   First_String_Id : constant String_Id := No_String + 1;
   --  First subscript allocated in string table

   -------------------------
   -- Character Code Type --
   -------------------------

   --  The type Char is used for character data internally in the compiler, but
   --  character codes in the source are represented by the Char_Code type.
   --  Each character literal in the source is interpreted as being one of the
   --  16#7FFF_FFFF# possible Wide_Wide_Character codes, and a unique Integer

   -- Representation of Time Stamps --
   -----------------------------------

   --  All compiled units are marked with a time stamp which is derived from
   --  the source file (we assume that the host system has the concept of a
   --  file time stamp which is modified when a file is modified). These
   --  time stamps are used to ensure consistency of the set of units that
   --  constitutes a library. Time stamps are 14-character strings with
   --  with the following format:

   --     YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

   --       YYYY   year
   --       MM     month (2 digits 01-12)
   --       DD     day (2 digits 01-31)
   --       HH     hour (2 digits 00-23)
   --       MM     minutes (2 digits 00-59)
   --       SS     seconds (2 digits 00-59)

   --  In the case of Unix systems (and other systems which keep the time in
   --  GMT), the time stamp is the GMT time of the file, not the local time.
   --  This solves problems in using libraries across networks with clients
   --  spread across multiple time-zones.

   --  string is represented, and instead should use the subprograms below.

   Dummy_Time_Stamp : constant Time_Stamp_Type := (others => '0');
   --  This is used for dummy time stamp values used in the D lines for

   --  The reason for this non-uniformity is that we do not want All_Checks to
   --  suppress elaboration checking when using the static elaboration model.
   --  We recognize only an explicit suppress of Elaboration_Check as a signal

   type Suppress_Array is array (Predefined_Check_Id) of Boolean;

   --  To add a new check type to GNAT, the following steps are required:

   -----------------------------------
   -- Global Exception Declarations --
   -----------------------------------

   --  This section contains declarations of exceptions that are used
   --  throughout the compiler or in other GNAT tools.

   Unrecoverable_Error : exception;
   --  This exception is raised to immediately terminate the compilation of the
   --  current source program. Used in situations where things are bad enough
   --  that it doesn't seem worth continuing (e.g. max errors reached, or a
   --  required file is not found). Also raised when the compiler finds itself
   --  in trouble after an error (see Comperr).

   Terminate_Program : exception;
   --  This exception is raised to immediately terminate the tool being
   --  executed. Each tool where this exception may be raised must have a
   --  single exception handler that contains only a null statement and that is
   --  the last statement of the program. If needed, procedure Set_Exit_Status
   --  is called with the appropriate exit status before raising
   --  Terminate_Program.

   ---------------------------------
   -- Parameter Mechanism Control --
   ---------------------------------

   --  Function and parameter entities have a field that records the passing
   --  mechanism. See specification of Sem_Mech for full details. The following
   --  subtype is used to represent values of this type:

   subtype Mechanism_Type is Int range -2 .. Int'Last;
   --  Type used to represent a mechanism value. This is a subtype rather than
   --  a type to avoid some annoying processing problems with certain routines
   --  in Einfo (processing them to create the corresponding C). The values in
   --  the range -2 .. 0 are used to represent mechanism types declared as
   --  named constants in the spec of Sem_Mech. Positive values are used for
   --  the case of a pragma C_Pass_By_Copy that sets a threshold value for the
   --  mechanism to be used. For example if pragma C_Pass_By_Copy (32) is given
   --  then Default_C_Record_Mechanism is set to 32, and the meaning is to use
   --  By_Reference if the size is greater than 32, and By_Copy otherwise.

   ---------------------------------
   -- Component_Alignment Control --
   ---------------------------------

   --  There are four types of alignment possible for array and record
   --  types, and a field in the type entities contains a value of the
   --  following type indicating which alignment choice applies. For full
   --  details of the meaning of these alignment types, see description
   --  of the Component_Alignment pragma.

   type Component_Alignment_Kind is (
      Calign_Default,          -- default alignment
      Calign_Component_Size,   -- natural alignment for component size
      Calign_Component_Size_4, -- natural for size <= 4, 4 for size >= 4
      Calign_Storage_Unit);    -- all components byte aligned

   -----------------------------------
   -- Floating Point Representation --
   -----------------------------------

   type Float_Rep_Kind is (IEEE_Binary);
   --  The only one supported now is IEEE 754p conforming binary format, but
   --  other formats were supported in the past, and could conceivably be
   --  supported in the future, so we keep this singleton enumeration type.

   ----------------------------
   -- Small_Paren_Count_Type --
   ----------------------------

   --  See Paren_Count in Atree for documentation

   subtype Small_Paren_Count_Type is Nat range 0 .. 3;

   ------------------------------
   -- Run-Time Exception Codes --
   ------------------------------

   --  When the code generator generates a run-time exception, it provides a
   --  reason code which is one of the following. This reason code is used to
   --  select the appropriate run-time routine to be called, determining both
   --  the exception to be raised, and the message text to be added.

   --  The prefix CE/PE/SE indicates the exception to be raised
   --    CE = Constraint_Error
   --    PE = Program_Error
   --    SE = Storage_Error

   --  The remaining part of the name indicates the message text to be added,
   --  where all letters are lower case, and underscores are converted to
   --  spaces (for example CE_Invalid_Data adds the text "invalid data").

   --  To add a new code, you need to do the following:

   --    1. Assign a new number to the reason. Do not renumber existing codes,
   --       since this causes compatibility/bootstrap issues, so always add the
   --       new code at the end of the list.

   --    2. Update the contents of the array Kind

   --    3. Modify the corresponding definitions in types.h, including the
   --       definition of last_reason_code.

   --    4. Add the name of the routines in exp_ch11.Get_RT_Exception_Name

   --    5. Add a new routine in Ada.Exceptions with the appropriate call and
   --       static string constant. Note that there is more than one version
   --       of a-except.adb which must be modified.

   --  Note on ordering of references. For the tables in Ada.Exceptions units,
   --  usually the ordering does not matter, and we use the same ordering as
   --  is used here.
