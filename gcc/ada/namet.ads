package Namet is

--  WARNING: There is a C version of this package. Any changes to this
--  source file must be properly reflected in the C header file namet.h

--  This package contains routines for handling the names table. The table
--  is used to store character strings for identifiers and operator symbols,
--  as well as other string values such as unit names and file names.

--  The forms of the entries are as follows:

--    Identifiers        Stored with upper case letters folded to lower case.
--                       Upper half (16#80# bit set) and wide characters are
--                       stored in an encoded form (Uhh for upper half char,
--                       Whhhh for wide characters, WWhhhhhhhh as provided by
--                       the routine Append_Encoded, where hh are hex
--                       digits for the character code using lower case a-f).
--                       Normally the use of U or W in other internal names is
--                       avoided, but these letters may be used in internal
--                       names (without this special meaning), if they appear
--                       as the last character of the name, or they are
--                       followed by an upper case letter (other than the WW
--                       sequence), or an underscore.

--    Operator symbols   Stored with an initial letter O, and the remainder
--                       of the name is the lower case characters XXX where
--                       the name is Name_Op_XXX, see Snames spec for a full
--                       list of the operator names. Normally the use of O
--                       in other internal names is avoided, but it may be
--                       used in internal names (without this special meaning)
--                       if it is the last character of the name, or if it is
--                       followed by an upper case letter or an underscore.

--    Character literals Character literals have names that are used only for
--                       debugging and error message purposes. The form is an
--                       upper case Q followed by a single lower case letter,
--                       or by a Uxx/Wxxxx/WWxxxxxxx encoding as described for
--                       identifiers. The Set_Character_Literal_Name procedure
--                       should be used to construct these encodings. Normally
--                       the use of O in other internal names is avoided, but
--                       it may be used in internal names (without this special
--                       meaning) if it is the last character of the name, or
--                       if it is followed by an upper case letter or an
--                       underscore.

--    Unit names         Stored with upper case letters folded to lower case,
--                       using Uhh/Whhhh/WWhhhhhhhh encoding as described for
--                       identifiers, and a %s or %b suffix for specs/bodies.
--                       See package Uname for further details.

--    File names         Are stored in the form provided by Osint. Typically
--                       they may include wide character escape sequences and
--                       upper case characters (in non-encoded form). Casing
--                       is also derived from the external environment. Note
--                       that file names provided by Osint must generally be
--                       consistent with the names from Fname.Get_File_Name.

--    Other strings      The names table is also used as a convenient storage
--                       location for other variable length strings such as
--                       error messages etc. There are no restrictions on what
--                       characters may appear for such entries.

--  Note: the encodings Uhh (upper half characters), Whhhh (wide characters),
--  WWhhhhhhhh (wide wide characters) and Qx (character literal names) are
--  described in the spec, since they are visible throughout the system (e.g.
--  in debugging output). However, no code should depend on these particular
--  encodings, so it should be possible to change the encodings by making
--  changes only to the Namet specification (to change these comments) and the
--  body (which actually implements the encodings).

--  The names are hashed so that a given name appears only once in the table,
--  except that names entered with Name_Enter as opposed to Name_Find are
--  omitted from the hash table.

--  The first 26 entries in the names table (with Name_Id values in the range
--  First_Name_Id .. First_Name_Id + 25) represent names which are the one
--  character lower case letters in the range a-z, and these names are created
--  and initialized by the Initialize procedure.

--  Five values, one of type Int, one of type Byte, and three of type Boolean,
--  are stored with each names table entry and subprograms are provided for
--  setting and retrieving these associated values. The usage of these values
--  is up to the client:

--    In the compiler we have the following uses:

--      The Int field is used to point to a chain of potentially visible
--      entities (see Sem.Ch8 for details).

--      The Byte field is used to hold the Token_Type value for reserved words
--      (see Sem for details).

--      The Boolean1 field is used to mark address clauses to optimize the
--      performance of the Exp_Util.Following_Address_Clause function.

--      The Boolean2 field is used to mark simple names that appear in
--      Restriction[_Warning]s pragmas for No_Use_Of_Entity. This avoids most
--      unnecessary searches of the No_Use_Of_Entity table.

--      The Boolean3 field is set for names of pragmas that are to be ignored
--      because of the occurrence of a corresponding pragma Ignore_Pragma.

--    In the binder, we have the following uses:

--      The Int field is used in various ways depending on the name involved,
--      see binder documentation for details.

--      The Byte and Boolean fields are unused.

--  Note that the value of the Int and Byte fields are initialized to zero,
--  and the Boolean field is initialized to False, when a new Name table entry
--  is created.

   type Bounded_String (Max_Length : Natural := 2**12) is limited
   --  It's unlikely to have names longer than this. But we don't want to make
   --  it too big, because we declare these on the stack in recursive routines.
   record
      Length : Natural := 0;
      Chars  : String (1 .. Max_Length);
   end record;

   --  To create a Name_Id, you can declare a Bounded_String as a local
   --  variable, and Append things onto it, and finally call Name_Find.
   --  You can also use a String, as in:
   --     X := Name_Find (Some_String & "_some_suffix");

   --  For historical reasons, we also have the Global_Name_Buffer below,
   --  which is used by most of the code via the renamings. New code ought
   --  to avoid the global.

   Global_Name_Buffer : Bounded_String (Max_Length => 4 * Max_Line_Length);
   Name_Buffer        : String renames Global_Name_Buffer.Chars;
   Name_Len           : Natural renames Global_Name_Buffer.Length;

   --  Note that there is some circuitry (e.g. Osint.Write_Program_Name) that
   --  does a save/restore on Name_Len and Name_Buffer (1 .. Name_Len). This
   --  works in part because Name_Len is default-initialized to 0.

   procedure Destroy_Global_Name_Buffer with Inline;
   --  Overwrites Global_Name_Buffer with meaningless data. This can be used in
   --  the transition away from Global_Name_Buffer, in order to detect cases
   --  where we incorrectly rely on the global.

   -- Types for Namet Package --
   -----------------------------

   --  Name_Id values are used to identify entries in the names table. Except
   --  for the special values No_Name and Error_Name, they are subscript values
   --  for the Names table defined in this package.

   --  Note that with only a few exceptions, which are clearly documented, the
   --  type Name_Id should be regarded as a private type. In particular it is
   --  never appropriate to perform arithmetic operations using this type.

   type Name_Id is range Names_Low_Bound .. Names_High_Bound;
   for Name_Id'Size use 32;
   --  Type used to identify entries in the names table

   No_Name : constant Name_Id := Names_Low_Bound;
   --  The special Name_Id value No_Name is used in the parser to indicate
   --  a situation where no name is present (e.g. on a loop or block).

   Error_Name : constant Name_Id := Names_Low_Bound + 1;
   --  The special Name_Id value Error_Name is used in the parser to
   --  indicate that some kind of error was encountered in scanning out
   --  the relevant name, so it does not have a representable label.

   First_Name_Id : constant Name_Id := Names_Low_Bound + 2;
   --  Subscript of first entry in names table

   subtype Valid_Name_Id is Name_Id range First_Name_Id .. Name_Id'Last;
   --  All but No_Name and Error_Name

   function Present (Nam : Name_Id) return Boolean;
   pragma Inline (Present);
   --  Determine whether name Nam exists

   function Name_Find
     (Buf : Bounded_String := Global_Name_Buffer) return Valid_Name_Id;
   function Name_Find (S : String) return Valid_Name_Id;
   --  Name_Find searches the names table to see if the string has already been
   --  stored. If so, the Id of the existing entry is returned. Otherwise a new
   --  entry is created with its Name_Table_Int fields set to zero/false. Note
   --  that it is permissible for Buf.Length to be zero to lookup the empty
   --  name string.

   function Name_Enter
     (Buf : Bounded_String := Global_Name_Buffer) return Valid_Name_Id;
   function Name_Enter (S : String) return Valid_Name_Id;
   --  Name_Enter is similar to Name_Find. The difference is that it does not
   --  search the table for an existing match, and also subsequent Name_Find
   --  calls using the same name will not locate the entry created by this
   --  call. Thus multiple calls to Name_Enter with the same name will create
   --  multiple entries in the name table with different Name_Id values. This
   --  is useful in the case of created names, which are never expected to be
   --  looked up. Note: Name_Enter should never be used for one character
   --  names, since these are efficiently located without hashing by Name_Find
   --  in any case.

   function Name_Equals
     (N1 : Valid_Name_Id;
      N2 : Valid_Name_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Return whether N1 and N2 denote the same character sequence

   function Get_Name_String (Id : Valid_Name_Id) return String;

   --  Append the characters of Id onto Buf. It is an error to call this with
   --  one of the special name Id values (No_Name or Error_Name).

   procedure Append_Decoded (Buf : in out Bounded_String; Id : Valid_Name_Id);
   --  Same as Append, except that the result is decoded, so that upper half
   --  characters and wide characters appear as originally found in the source
   --  program text, operators have their source forms (special characters and
   --  enclosed in quotes), and character literals appear surrounded by
   --  apostrophes.

   procedure Append_Decoded_With_Brackets
     (Buf : in out Bounded_String;
      Id  : Valid_Name_Id);
   --  Same as Append_Decoded, except that the brackets notation (Uhh
   --  replaced by ["hh"], Whhhh replaced by ["hhhh"], WWhhhhhhhh replaced by
   --  ["hhhhhhhh"]) is used for all non-lower half characters, regardless of
   --  how Opt.Wide_Character_Encoding_Method is set, and also in that
   --  characters in the range 16#80# .. 16#FF# are converted to brackets
   --  notation in all cases. This routine can be used when there is a
   --  requirement for a canonical representation not affected by the
   --  character set options (e.g. in the binder generation of symbols).

   procedure Append_Unqualified
     (Buf : in out Bounded_String; Id : Valid_Name_Id);
   --  Same as Append, except that qualification (as defined in unit
   --  Exp_Dbug) is removed (including both preceding __ delimited names, and
   --  also the suffixes used to indicate package body entities and to
   --  distinguish between overloaded entities). Note that names are not
   --  qualified until just before the call to gigi, so this routine is only
   --  needed by processing that occurs after gigi has been called.

   procedure Append_Unqualified_Decoded
     (Buf : in out Bounded_String;
      Id  : Valid_Name_Id);
   --  Same as Append_Unqualified, but decoded as for Append_Decoded

   procedure Append_Encoded (Buf : in out Bounded_String; C : Char_Code);
   --  Appends given character code at the end of Buf. Lower case letters and
   --  digits are stored unchanged. Other 8-bit characters are stored using the
   --  Uhh encoding (hh = hex code), other 16-bit wide character values are
   --  stored using the Whhhh (hhhh = hex code) encoding, and other 32-bit wide
   --  wide character values are stored using the WWhhhhhhhh (hhhhhhhh = hex
   --  code). Note that this procedure does not fold upper case letters (they
   --  are stored using the Uhh encoding).

   --  with an underscore.
   --
   --  Note: if the name is qualified (has a double underscore), then only the
   --  final entity name is considered, not the qualifying names. Consider for
   --  example that the name:
   --
   --    pkg__B_1__xyz
   --
   --  is not an internal name, because the B comes from the internal name of
   --  a qualifying block, but the xyz means that this was indeed a declared
   --  identifier called "xyz" within this block and there is nothing internal
   --  about that name.

   function Is_OK_Internal_Letter (C : Character) return Boolean;
   pragma Inline (Is_OK_Internal_Letter);
   --  Returns true if C is a suitable character for using as a prefix or a

   --  This is a dummy procedure. It is retained for easy compatibility with
   --  clients who used to call Initialize when this call was required. Now
   --  initialization is performed automatically during package elaboration.
   --  Note that this change fixes problems which existed prior to the change
   --  of Initialize being called more than once. See also Reinitialize which
   --  allows reinitialization of the tables.

   procedure Reinitialize;
   --  Clears the name tables and removes all existing entries from the table.

   procedure Reset_Name_Table;
   --  This procedure is used when there are multiple source files to reset the
   --  name table info entries associated with current entries in the names
   --  table. There is no harm in keeping the names entries themselves from one
   --  compilation to another, but we can't keep the entity info, since this
   --  refers to tree nodes, which are destroyed between each main source file.

   procedure Finalize;
   --  Called at the end of a use of the Namet package (before a subsequent
   --  call to Initialize). Currently this routine is only used to generate
   --  debugging output.

   procedure Lock;
   --  Lock name tables before calling back end. We reserve some extra space
   --  before locking to avoid unnecessary inefficiencies when we unlock.

   procedure Unlock;
   --  Unlocks the name table to allow use of the extra space reserved by the
   --  call to Lock. See gnat1drv for details of the need for this.

   procedure Unlock_If_Locked;
   --  If the name table is locked, calls Unlock. Otherwise, does nothing.

   procedure Write_Name (Id : Valid_Name_Id);
   --  Write_Name writes the characters of the specified name using the
   --  standard output procedures in package Output. The name is written
   --  in encoded form (i.e. including Uhh, Whhh, Qx, _op as they appear in
   --  the name table). If Id is Error_Name or No_Name, no text is output.

   procedure Write_Name_Decoded (Id : Valid_Name_Id);
   --  Like Write_Name, except that the name written is the decoded name, as
   --  described for Append_Decoded.

   procedure Write_Name_For_Debug (Id : Name_Id; Quote : String := "");
   --  Like Write_Name, except it tries to be robust in the presence of invalid
   --  data, and valid names are surrounded by Quote.

   function Name_Entries_Count return Nat;
   --  Return current number of entries in the names table

   function Last_Name_Id return Name_Id;
   --  Return the last Name_Id in the table. This information is valid until
