   JSON_FORMATTING : constant Boolean := True;
   --  Adds newlines and indentation to the output JSON.
   --
   --  NOTE: This flag could be associated with the gcc switch:
   --  '-fno-diagnostics-json-formatting'

   INDENT_SIZE : constant := 2;
   --  The number of spaces to indent each level of the JSON output.

   Indent_Level : Natural := 0;
   --  The current indentation level.

   procedure Begin_Block;
   --  Increase the indentation level by one

   procedure End_Block;
   --  Decrease the indentation level by one

   procedure Indent;
   --  Print the indentation for the line

   procedure NL_And_Indent;
   --  Print a new line

   function To_File_Uri (Path : String) return String;
   --  Converts an absolute Path into a file URI string by adding the file
   --  schema prefix "file:///" and replacing all of the URI reserved
   --  characters in the absolute path.

   procedure Write_Boolean_Attribute (Name : String; Value : Boolean);
   --  Write a JSON attribute with a boolean value.
   --
   --  The value is either 'true' or 'false' without any quotes

   procedure Write_Int_Attribute (Name : String; Value : Int);

   procedure Write_JSON_Escaped_String (Str : String);
   --  Write each character of Str, taking care of preceding each quote and
   --  backslash with a backslash. Note that this escaping differs from what
   --  GCC does.
   --
   --  Indeed, the JSON specification mandates encoding wide characters
   --  either as their direct UTF-8 representation or as their escaped
   --  UTF-16 surrogate pairs representation. GCC seems to prefer escaping -
   --  we choose to use the UTF-8 representation instead.

   procedure Write_String_Attribute (Name : String; Value : String);
   --  Write a JSON attribute with a string value.
   --
   --  The Value is surrounded by double quotes ("") and the special characters
   --  within the string are escaped.
