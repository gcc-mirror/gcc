   --  global entities are marked on terminal nodes. Note that this function
   --  copies any aspect specifications from the input node N to the returned
   --  node, as well as the setting of the Has_Aspects flag.

   --  The flag Body_Optional indicates that the call is for an instance
   --  that precedes the current instance in the same declarative part.
   --  This call is needed when instantiating a nested generic whose body
   --  is to be found in the body of an instance. Normally we instantiate
   --  package bodies only when they appear in the main unit, or when their
   --  contents are needed for a nested generic G. If unit U contains several
   --  instances I1, I2, etc. and I2 contains a nested generic, then when U
   --  appears in the context of some other unit P that contains an instance
   --  of G, we compile the body of I2, but not that of I1. However, when we
   --  compile U as the main unit, we compile both bodies. This will lead to
   --  link-time errors if the compilation of I1 generates public symbols,
   --  because those in I2 will receive different names in both cases. This
   --  forces us to analyze the body of I1 even when U is not the main unit.
   --  We don't want this additional mechanism to generate an error when the
   --  body of the generic for I1 is not present, and this is the reason for
   --  the presence of the flag Body_Optional, which is exchanged between the
   --  current procedure and Load_Parent_Of_Generic.

   procedure Save_Global_References (Templ : Node_Id);
   --  Traverse the original generic unit, and capture all references to
   --  entities that are defined outside of the generic in the analyzed tree
   --  for the template. These references are copied into the original tree,
   --  so that they appear automatically in every instantiation. A critical
   --  invariant in this approach is that if an id in the generic resolves to
   --  a local entity, the corresponding id in the instance will resolve to
   --  the homologous entity in the instance, even though the enclosing context
   --  for resolution is different, as long as the global references have been
   --  captured as described here.

   --  Because instantiations can be nested, the environment of the instance,
   --  involving the actuals and other data-structures, must be saved and
   --  restored in stack-like fashion. Front-end inlining also uses these
   --  structures for the management of private/full views.

   --  that appear on node N.

   procedure Set_Copied_Sloc_For_Inlined_Body (N : Node_Id; E : Entity_Id);
   --  This procedure is used when a subprogram body is inlined. This process
   --  shares the same circuitry as the creation of an instantiated copy of
   --  a generic template. The call to this procedure establishes a new source
   --  file entry representing the inlined body as an instantiation, marked as
   --  an inlined body (so that errout can distinguish cases for generating
   --  error messages, otherwise the treatment is identical). In this call
   --  N is the subprogram body and E is the defining identifier of the
   --  subprogram in question. The resulting Sloc adjustment factor is
   --  saved as part of the internal state of the Sem_Ch12 package for use
   --  in subsequent calls to copy nodes.

   procedure Set_Copied_Sloc_For_Inherited_Pragma
     (N : Node_Id;
      E : Entity_Id);
   --  This procedure is used when a class-wide pre- or postcondition is
   --  inherited. This process shares the same circuitry as the creation of
   --  an instantiated copy of a generic template. The call to this procedure
   --  establishes a new source file entry representing the inherited pragma
   --  as an instantiation, marked as an inherited pragma (so that errout can
   --  distinguish cases for generating error messages, otherwise the treatment
   --  is identical). In this call, N is the subprogram declaration from
   --  which the pragma is inherited and E is the defining identifier of
   --  the overriding subprogram (when the subprogram is redefined) or the
   --  defining identifier of the extension type (when the subprogram is
   --  inherited). The resulting Sloc adjustment factor is saved as part of the
   --  internal state of the Sem_Ch12 package for use in subsequent calls to
   --  copy nodes.

   procedure Adjust_Inherited_Pragma_Sloc (N : Node_Id);
   --  This procedure is used when a class-wide pre- or postcondition
   --  is inherited. It is called on each node of the pragma expression
   --  to adjust its sloc. These call should be preceded by a call to
   --  Set_Copied_Sloc_For_Inherited_Pragma that sets the required sloc
   --  adjustment. This is done directly, instead of using Copy_Generic_Node
   --  to copy nodes and adjust slocs, as Copy_Generic_Node expects a specific
   --  structure to be in place, which is not the case for inherited pragmas.

   procedure Save_Env
     (Gen_Unit : Entity_Id;
      Act_Unit : Entity_Id);
   --  Because instantiations can be nested, the compiler maintains a stack
   --  of environments that holds variables relevant to the current instance:
   --  most importanty Instantiated_Parent, Exchanged_Views, Hidden_Entities,
   --  and others (see full list in Instance_Env).

   procedure Restore_Env;
   --  After processing an instantiation, or aborting one because of semantic
   --  errors, remove the current Instantiation_Env from Instantation_Envs.

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Initializes internal data structures

   procedure Check_Private_View (N : Node_Id);
   --  Check whether the type of a generic entity has a different view between
   --  the point of generic analysis and the point of instantiation. If the
   --  view has changed, then at the point of instantiation we restore the
   --  correct view to perform semantic analysis of the instance, and reset
   --  the current view after instantiation. The processing is driven by the
   --  current private status of the type of the node, and Has_Private_View,
   --  a flag that is set at the point of generic compilation. If view and
   --  flag are inconsistent then the type is updated appropriately.
   --
   --  This subprogram is used in Check_Generic_Actuals and Copy_Generic_Node,
   --  and is exported here for the purpose of front-end inlining (see Exp_Ch6.
