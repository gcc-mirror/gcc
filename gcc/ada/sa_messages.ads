package SA_Messages is

   --  This package can be used for reading/writing a file containing a
   --  sequence of static anaysis results. Each element can describe a runtime
   --  check whose outcome has been statically determined, or it might be a
   --  warning or diagnostic message. It is expected that typically CodePeer
   --  will do the writing and SPARK will do the reading; this will allow SPARK
   --  to get the benefit of CodePeer's analysis.
   --
   --  Each item is represented as a pair consisting of a message and an
   --  associated source location. Source locations may refer to a location
   --  within the expansion of an instance of a generic; this is represented
   --  by combining the corresponding location within the generic with the
   --  location of the instance (repeated if the instance itself occurs within
   --  a generic). In addition, the type Iteration_Id is intended for use in
   --  distinguishing messages which refer to a specific iteration of a loop
   --  (this case can arise, for example, if CodePeer chooses to unroll a
   --  for-loop). This data structure is only general enough to support the
   --  kinds of unrolling that are currently planned for CodePeer. For
   --  example, an Iteration_Id can only identify an iteration of the nearest
   --  enclosing loop of the associated File/Line/Column source location.
   --  This is not a problem because CodePeer doesn't unroll loops which
   --  contain other loops.

   --  TBD: it might be nice to distinguish these different kinds of assertions
