	* exp_ch6.adb (Make_Build_In_Place_Call_In_Object_Declaration): Handle
	properly object declarations with initializations that are
	build-in-place function calls, when there is an address specification,
	either as an aspect specification or an explicit attribute
	specification clause, for the initialized object.
	* freeze.adb (Check_Address_Clause): Do not remove side-effects from

	concurrent, nor effectively volatile.
	* ghost.adb (Check_Ghost_Type): New routine.
	* ghost.ads (Check_Ghost_Type): New routine.
	* sem_util.adb (Is_Declaration): Reimplemented. The routine can now
	consider specific subsets of declarations.

	replicated by Is_Declaration.
	* sem_util.ads (Is_Declaration): New parameter profile. Update the
	comment on usage.
	(Is_Declaration_Other_Than_Renaming): Removed.

2018-01-11  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	as Part_Of consituents of single protected types are illegal when they
	take place inside a protected function.
	(Diagnose_Non_Variable_Lhs): Use Within_Function to check for an
	enclosing function.
	(Is_Protected_Part_Of_Constituent): New routine.
	(Within_Function): New routine.

2018-01-11  Arnaud Charlet  <charlet@adacore.com>

	Bump copyright notices to 2018.

2018-01-11  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* binde.adb, par-ch6.adb, par-ch9.adb, sem_ch12.adb, sem_ch13.adb:
	Minor reformatting.

	(Make_Build_In_Place_Call_In_Object_Declaration): Update the call to
	Establish_Transient_Scope.
	* exp_ch7.adb (Establish_Transient_Scope): Restructured. Delegate the
	management of the secondary stack to an enclosing scope if there is no
	suitable construct to wrap, and the transient scope was intended to
	manage the secondary stack.
	(Find_Node_To_Be_Wrapped): Restructured. A case_statement_alternative
	is a valid boundary for a transient expression which comes from the
	statements of the alternative, otherwise alternatives cannot be
	wrapped. Assignments of controlled objects which have controlled
	actions suppressed now stop the traversal as there is no point in
	looking for an enclosing construct. Add several N_xxx_Body choices to
	the termination conditions for completeness.
	* exp_ch7.ads (Establish_Transient_Scope): Update the parameter profile
	and the associated comment on usage.

	actions are required by utilizing predicate Needs_Finalization rather
	than Is_Controlled.
	(Resolve_Call): Type initialization procedures can now utilize
	transient scopes to manage the secondary stack, thus preventing leaks
	during initialization.  Remove the previous kludgy algorithm which
	attempts to manage the secondary stack at the object creation site.

2018-01-11  Jerome Lambourg  <lambourg@adacore.com>

	* libgnat/g-soliop__qnx.ads: New.
	* adaint.c, adaint.h, cstreams.c, s-oscons-tmplt.c, sysdep.c: Update

	* sem_ch12.adb (Check_Fixed_Point_Type): Do not apply check if the
	formsl type corresponding to the actual fixed point type is private,
	because in this case there can be no suspicious arithmetic operations
	in the generic unless they reference a formal subprogram.  Clarify
	warning.

2018-01-11  Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>

	* exp_util.adb (Remove_Side_Effects): No action done for functions
	returning class-wide types since it requires generating code using
	'reference and the CCG target has no secondary stack.
	* gnat1drv.adb: Disable building static dispatch tables when generating
	C code.

2018-01-11  Piotr Trojanek  <trojanek@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Analyze_Pragma, case Predicate): Indicate that the type
	has a delayed aspect which must be processed at the point the type is

	overflow.
	(SS_Info): Align colons.
	(SS_Init): Cover the case when bootstraping with an old compiler that
	does not set Default_SS_Size.

2018-01-11  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch3.adb (Add_Internal_Interface_Entities): When checking the
	legality of an inherited operation that may require overriding, ignore
	primitive_wrappers that correspond to explicit operations that override
	an interface primitive.
	* exp_util.adb (Build_Class_Wide_Expression, Replace_Entity): If the
	operation to which the class-wide expression applies is a protected op.
	with a primitive_wrapper, verify that the updated inherited expression
	does not contain an internal call to a protected function.  This
	completes the implementation of AI12-0166.

2018-01-11  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* ali.adb: Document the remaining letters available for ALI lines.
	(Scan_ALI): A with clause is internal when it is encoded on a 'Z' line.

	either implicitly or explicitly withed.
	(Is_Implicit_With_Clause): New routine.

	* rtsfind.adb (Maybe_Add_With): Code cleanup.
	* sem_ch8.adb (Present_System_Aux): Code cleanup.
	* sem_ch10.adb (Expand_With_Clause): Mark the with clause as generated
	for a parent unit.
	(Implicit_With_On_Parent): Mark the with clause as generated for a
	parent unit.
	* sem_ch12.adb (Inherit_Context): With clauses inherited by an
	instantiation are no longer marked as Implicit_With_From_Instantiation
	because they are already marked as implicit.
	* sem_elab.adb (Ensure_Prior_Elaboration_Static): Remove the kludge
	which marks implicit with clauses as related to an instantiation.
	* sinfo.adb (Implicit_With_From_Instantiation): Removed.
	(Parent_With): New routine.
	(Set_Implicit_With_From_Instantiation): Removed.
	(Set_Parent_With): New routine.

	entity when the enclosing construct is a body.

2018-01-11  Patrick Bernardi  <bernardi@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch9.adb (Expand_N_Task_Type_Declaration): Simplified
	Secondary_Stack_Size handling as a pragma is now generated for the
	corresponding aspect instead of an attribute.  Pragma expression is
	relocated instead of evaluated. Discriminant of the corresponding
	record type is referenced rather than the type discriminant.
	(Create_Secondary_Stack_For_Task, Make_Task_Create_Call): Update
	Secondary_Stack_Size rep item checks to only look for the pragma rep.
	* sem_ch13.adb (Analyze_One_Aspect): Transform
	Aspect_Secondary_Stack_Size into a pragma instead of an attribute
	because the attribute does not have visibility on a task type's
	discriminants when the type's definition is expanded.

	Attribute_Secondary_Stack_Size.
	* snames.adb-tmpl, snames.ads-tmpl: Remove

	individual action because the action may denote a complex expression,
	such as a case statement, which in turn may contain additional
	transient objects.

2018-01-11  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_aggr.adb (Resolve_Iterated_Component_Association): Perform
	analysis on a copy of the expression with a copy of the index variable,
	because full expansion will rewrite construct into a loop with the
	original loop variable.
	* exp_aggr.adb (Gen_Assign): Defer analysis and resolution if the
	expression is an iterated component association. Full analysis takes
	place when construct is rewritten as a loop.
	(In_Place_Assign_OK, Safe_Component): An iterated_component_association
	is not safe for in-place assignment.
	* sem_util.adb (Remove_Entity): Handle properly the case of an isolated
	entity with no homonym and no other entity in the scope.
