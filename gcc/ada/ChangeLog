	* prj.ads, makeutl.adb, makeutl.ads (Queue.Insert): now also inserts
	the "roots" for a main.
	(Fill_From_Project): add support for aggregate projects. Main units
	in aggregated projects are now automatically added in the list of

	these files are not using the root proejct tree, so this needs
	further cleanup)
	* gcc-interface/Make-lang.in: Update dependencies.

	* make.adb, prj.adb, prj.ads, makeutl.adb, makeutl.ads
	(Insert_Project_Sources, Insert_withed_Sources_For): moved from the
	gprbuild sources.
	These packages are more logically placed in the Queue package, since
	they manipulate the queue. It is also likely that they can be adapted
	for gnatmake, thus sharing more code.
	(Finish_Program, Fail_Program): moved from the gprbuild sources, so
	that we could move the above.

2011-08-03  Emmanuel Briot  <briot@adacore.com>

	* errutil.adb (Finalize): clean up the list of error messages on exit.

2011-08-03  Yannick Moy  <moy@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch11.adb (Analyze_Raise_xxx_Error): do not mark such nodes as not
	in ALFA. Instead, they are considered as assertions to prove.
	* sem_ch4.adb (Analyze_Conditional_Expression): do not always mark such
	nodes as not in ALFA. Instead, include conditional expressions in ALFA
	if they have no ELSE part, or if they occur in pre- and postconditions,
	where the Condition cannot have side-effects in ALFA
	(Analyze_Membership_Op): do not mark such nodes as not in ALFA
	(Analyze_Type_Conversion): do not always mark such nodes as not in ALFA.
	Instead, include type conversion between scalar types in ALFA.
	* sem_ch6.adb (Process_Formals): correctly mark a parameter in ALFA
	if-and-only-if its type is in ALFA.

	compilation unit and call a callback parameter on all declarations

2011-08-03  Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Process_Interface_Name): Allow duplicated export names
	in Java since they are always enclosed in a namespace that
	differentiates them, and overloaded entities are supported by the VM.

2011-08-03  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* checks.adb (Determine_Range): If a computed bound of an operation is
	outside the range of the base type of the expression, and overflow
	checks are enabled, the result is unknown and cannot be used for any
	subsequent constant folding.
	* sem_eval.adb (Compile_Time_Compare): if the bounds of one operand are
	unknown, so is the result of the comparison.

	Original_Discriminant cannot be used any more for computing the
	defining name for the reference to a discriminant.

2011-08-03  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_disp.adb (Is_Tag_Indeterminate): If the return type of the
	function is not visibly tagged, this is not a dispatching call and
	therfore is not Tag_Indeterminate, even if the function is marked as
	dispatching on result.

2011-08-03  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_warn.adb (Check_One_Unit): if the only mention of a withed unit
	is a renaming declaration in the private part of a package, do not emit
	a warning that the with_clause could be moved because the renaming may
	be used in the body or in a child unit.

2011-08-03  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	Raise_From_Controlled_Operation when this routine is not present in
	the run-time library.
	(Cleanup_Protected_Object, Cleanup_Task): For restricted run-time

	and tasks can only appear at library level, so we do not want
	finalization of protected objects nor tasks.

	* exp_ch13.adb: Add with and use clause for Targparm;
	(Expand_N_Free_Statement): Prevent the generation of a custom
	Deallocate on .NET/JVM targets since this requires pools and address
	arithmetic.
	* exp_ch4.adb (Expand_Allocator_Expression): When compiling for
	.NET/JVM targets, attach the newly allocated object to the access
	type's finalization collection. Do not generate a call to
	Set_Finalize_Address_Ptr on .NET/JVM because this routine does not
	exist in the runtime.
	(Expand_N_Allocator): When compiling for .NET/JVM targets, do not
	create a custom Allocate for object that do not require initialization.
	Attach a newly allocated object to the access type's finalization
	collection on .NET/JVM.
	* exp_ch5.adb (Make_Tag_Ctrl_Assignment): Add special processing for
	assignment of controlled types on .NET/JVM. The two hidden pointers
	Prev and Next and stored and later restored after the assignment takes
	place.
	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_Call): Add local constant Curr_S. Add specialized
	kludge for .NET/JVM to recognize a particular piece of code coming from
	Heap_Management and change the call to Finalize into Deep_Finalize.
	* exp_ch7.adb (Build_Finalization_Collection): Allow the creation of
	finalization collections on .NET/JVM only for types derived from

	* a-fihema.ads, a-fihema.adb: New GNAT unit.
	Ada.Finalization.Heap_Management provides key functionality
	associated with controlled objects on the heap, their creation,
	finalization and reclamation. Type Finalization_Collection is
	effectively a wrapper which sits ontop of a storage pool and performs
	all necessary bookkeeping for all the objects it contains. Each
	access-to-controlled or access-to-class-wide type receives a collection
	as part of its expansion. The compiler generates buffer code and
	invokes Allocate / Deallocate to create and destroy allocated
	controlled objects.
	* a-finali.adb ("="): Removed.
	* a-finali.ads ("="): Removed. Controlled types no longer carry hidden
	fields Prev and Next.
	* ali.adb (Scan_ALI): Add parsing code to process PF / Has_Finalizer.
	A library unit with at least one controlled object on the library level
	has a special finalizer which is invoked by the binder. To signal this,

	associated comment on field usage.
	* a-tags.adb (Get_RC_Offset): Removed.

	runtime indication whether a type is controlled or has controlled
	components or both. Remove field RC_Offset.
	(Get_RC_Offset): Removed along with its associated pragma Export.
	Since tagged types with controlled components no longer carry hidden
	field _controller, the special mechanism to retrieve its location is no
	longer needed.
	(Needs_Finalization): New routine.
	* atree.ads, atree.adb (Elist24): New routine.
	(Set_Elist24): New routine.
	* atree.h: Add a define clause for Elist24.
	* bindgen.adb New library-level variable Lib_Final_Built.
	(Gen_Adafinal_Ada): Reimplemented. Depending on the restrictions or the
	presence of a VM target, the routine generates calls to the proper
	library finalization routine.
	(Gen_Adainit_Ada): Import Finalize_Library_Objects only on non-VM
	targets. Set the correct library finalization routine depending on
	whether the library has controlled objects or this is a VM compilation.
	(Gen_Finalize_Library_Ada): New routine. This procedure generates calls
	to library-level finalizers of compiled units in reverse order of
	elaboration. It also produces exception management code and reraises a
	potential exception after all units have been finalized.
	(Gen_Finalize_Library_C): New routine. This procedure generates calls to
	library-level finalizers of compiled units in reverse order of
	elaboration.
	(Gen_Finalize_Library_Defs_C): New routine. This procedure generates the
	definitions of all library-level finalizers available to the compilation
	(Gen_Main_Ada): Directly call Adafinal which now contails all target
	dependent code.
	(Gen_Main_C): Add new local constant Needs_Library_Finalization. Call
	System.Standard_Library.Adafinal directly. If the library needs
	finalization actions, create the sequence of finalization calls.
	(Gen_Output_File_Ada): Alphabetize local variables and constants.
	Generate a with clause for System.Soft_Links when compiling for a VM.
	Remove the code which imports System.Standard_Library.Adafinal as
	Do_Finalize. Generate the library finalization routine.
	(Gen_Output_File_C): Add new local constant Needs_Library_Finalization.
	If the library needs finalization actions, create all the definitions
	of library- level finalizers.
	(Has_Finalizer): New routine. Determines whether at least one compiled
	unit has a library-level finalizer.
	Add type Qualification_Mode.
	(Set_Unit_Name): Add a formal which controls the replacement of a dot.
	* einfo.adb: New usage of field 15 as Return_Flag.

2011-08-03  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Resolve_Aggregate): An array aggregate with 'others' is
	always legal on the right-hand side of an assignment statement; there
	is always an applicable index constraint in this case. Therefore, the
	check for Pkind = N_Assignment_Statement is now unconditional -- it
	doesn't depend on whether Is_Constrained (Typ).

2011-08-03  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch5.adb (Expand_N_Assignment_Statement): Do not force inlining of
	tagged assignment when discriminant checks are suppressed. This is
	useless and extremely costly in terms of static stack usage.

2011-08-03  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Get_Base_Subprogram): Do not follow Alias for instances
	of generics, because this leads to the wrong entity in the wrong scope,
	causing (e.g.) pragma Export_Procedure to get an error if the entity is
	an instance.
	(Process_Interface_Name): Follow Alias for instances of generics, to
	correct for the above change.

2011-08-03  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch4.adb (Expand_N_Selected_Component): If the discriminant value
	is an integer literal it is always safe to replace the reference. In
	addition, if the reference appears in the generated code for an object
	declaration it is necessary to copy because otherwise the reference
	might be to the uninitilized value of the discriminant of the object
	itself.

2011-08-03  Pascal Obry  <obry@adacore.com>

	iterators.

2011-08-03  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_res.adb (Set_String_Literal_Subtype): if the lower bound of the

2011-08-03  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch3.adb (Analyze_Object_Declaration): if a constant object of an
	unconstrained type with discriminants is initialized with an aggregate,
	use the constrained subtype of the aggregate as the type of the object,
	because it is immutable, and this allows the back-end to generate no
	code for the object declaration.

2011-08-03  Robert Dewar  <dewar@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch4.adb (Optimize_Length_Check): Fix bad handling of case where

	been excluded from being private dependents.
	* sem_ch7.adb (Uninstall_Declarations): When checking the rule of
	RM05-3.10.1(9.3/2), test that a subprogram in the Private_Dependents

	cases where nonprimitives can be in the list (such as subprograms in
	nested packages).
	* sem_disp.adb (Derives_From): Use correct condition for checking that
	a formal's type is derived from the type of the corresponding formal in
	the parent subprogram (the condition was completely wrong). Add
	checking that was missing for controlling result types being derived
	from the result type of the parent operation.
