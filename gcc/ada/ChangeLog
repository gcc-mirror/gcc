	* gcc-interface/decl.c (gnat_to_gnu_entity) <case E_Record_Subtype>:
	Tidy up.  For a subtype with discriminants and variant part, if a

	no variant part but representation clause is present.
	* gcc-interface/utils.c (make_packable_type): Robustify.
	(maybe_pad_type): Use local variable and tidy up condition.  If no
	alignment is specified, use the original one.
