	Reinstate conversion of the actual to the type of the formal

	from a fat or thin pointer type and a constrained object type.
	(build_unary_op) <ADDR_EXPR>: Always recurse down conversions between
	types variants, and process special cases of VIEW_CONVERT expressions
	as their NOP_EXPR counterpart to ensure we get to the
	CORRESPONDING_VARs associated with CONST_DECls.
	(build_binary_op) <MODIFY_EXPR>: Do not strip VIEW_CONVERT_EXPRs
	on the right-hand side.

	* utils.c (build_unc_object_type_from_ptr): New subprogram, factoring
	a common pattern.
	(convert) <VIEW_CONVERT_EXPR>: Return the inner operand directly if we

	(convert) <JM input>: Fallthrough regular conversion code instead of
	extracting the object if converting to a type variant.

	generation and we are at the top level, check for a potential violation
	of a No_Elaboration_Code restriction.

	SIZE and SIZE_UNIT which we need for later back-annotations.

	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_Call): If an actual is a function call rewritten
	from object notation, the original node is unanalyzed and carries no

	load comes from a Limited_With_Clause.

	* lib-load.adb (From_Limited_With_Chain): New predicate to determine

	* g-pehage.ads, g-pehage.adb (Select_Char_Position): When no character
	position set is provided, we compute one in order to reduce the maximum
	length of the keys.  This computation first selects a character
	position between 1 and the minimum length of the keys in order to
	avoid reducing one of the keys to an empty string.
	(Initialize, Compute): When the ratio V to K is too low, the algorithm
	does not converge. The initialization procedure now comes with a
	maximum number of iterations such that when exceeded, an exception is
	raised in Compute. The user can initialize this ratio to another value
	and try again
	Reformating and updated headers.

	* sem_attr.adb (Resolve_Attribute, case 'Address): For an illegal
	'Address attribute reference with an overloaded prefix, use the
	location of the prefix (not the location of the attribute reference) as
	the error location.
	(Analyze_Attribute, case 'Size): The name of an enumeration literal, or
	a function renaming thereof, is a valid prefix for 'Size (where it is
	intepreted as a function call).
	(Statically_Denotes_Entity): New predicate to determine whether the

	    Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch10.adb (In_Chain): Moved from the scope of a subprogram to
	become local to the whole package.
	(Install_Limited_Withed_Unit): Instead of unchaining real entities if
	the package was already analyzed the new algorithm "replaces" the
	real entities by the shadow ones. This is required to ensure that
	the order of these entities in the homonym chains does not change;
	otherwise we can have undefined references at linking time because
	in case of conflicts the external name of the entities will have
	a suffix that depends on the order of the entities in the chain.
	(Remove_Limited_With_Clause): Complementary code that completes the
	new algorithm and replaces the shadow entities by the real ones.
	(Install_Limited_Withed_Unit): When unchaining entities before the
	installation of the shadow entities, only regular entities of the
	public part must be taken into account. This is required to
	keep this routine in synch with the work done by Remove_Limited_
	With_Clause
	(Install_Limited_With_Clause): Introduce implicit limited_with_clause
	even if unit is analyzed, because the analysis of the unit is
	idempotent in any case, and the limited view of the unit may have to
	be installed for proper visibility.
	(Expand_Limited_With_Clause): Even if the unit in the implicit
	with_clause has been analyzed already, a limited view of the package
	must be built for the current context, if it does not exist yet.

	    Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>
	    Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch12.adb (Instantiate_Subprogram_Body): When creating the
	defining entity for the instance body, make a new defining identifier
	rather than copying the entity of the spec, to prevent accidental
	sharing of the entity list.
	(Check_Private_View): When exchanging views of private types, build the
	list of exchanged views as a stack, to ensure that on exit the exchanges
	are undone in the proper order.
	(Analyze_Package_Instantiation, Analyze_Subprogram_Instantiation):
	Restore the compilation environment in case of instantiation_error.
	(Analyze_Generic_Subprogram_Declaration): Handle creation of type entity
	for an anonymous access result.
	(Instantiate_Generic_Subprogram): Subtype_Mark => Result_Definition
	(Formal_Entity): Handle properly the case of a formal package that
	denotes a generic package renaming.

2005-09-01  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch13.adb (Analyze_Enumeration_Representation_Clause): Reject the

2005-09-01  Cyrille Comar  <comar@adacore.com>
	    Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>
	    Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>
	    Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch3.ads, sem_ch3.adb (Analyze_Object_Declaration): Go to the
	underlying type
	to check if a type is Constrained in cases related to code generation
	(rather than semantic checking) since otherwise we do not generate
	similar code for mutable private types depending if their
	discriminants are visible or not.
	(Check_Abstract_Overriding): Do not complain about failure to override
	the primitive operations used in dispatching selects since they will
	always be overriden at the freeze point of the type.
	(Access_Definition): Separate out handling for resetting the scope
	of an anonymous access function result type. Retrieve the scope
	of the associated function rather than using Current_Scope, which
	does not have a consistent value (depends on whether we're in the
	middle of analyzing formal parameters). Add ??? comment about
	finding a cleaner way to handle the special cases of scope setting.
	(Process_Incomplete_Dependents): A protected operation is never a
	dispatching operation (only its wrapper may be).
	(Build_Derived_Record_Type): In case of tagged private types that
	implement interfaces add derivation of predefined primitive
	operations.
	(Derive_Subprograms): Replace the Is_Interface_Derivation parameter
	by two parameters that are used in case of derivation from abstract
	interface types: No_Predefined_Prims is used to avoid the derivation
	of predefined primitives from the interface, and Predefined
	Prims_Only is used to complete the derivation predefined primitives
	in case of private tagged types implementing interfaces.
	Fix typo in comments
	(Find_Interface_In_Descendant): Protect the frontend against
	wrong code with large circularity chains.
	(Is_Private_Overriding): Add support for entities overriding interface
	subprograms. The test failed because Entities associated with overriden
	interface subprograms are always marked as hidden (and used to build
	the secondary dispatch table); in this case the overriden entity is
	available through the field abstract_interface_alias (cf. override_
	dispatching_operation)
	(Access_Definition): Set the scope of the type to Current_Scope for the
	case of a function with an anonymous access result type.
	(Access_Subprogram_Declaration): Handle creation of the type entity for
	an access-to-function type with an anonymous access result.
	(Check_Anonymous_Access_Types): Change Subtype_Mark to Result_Definition
	in handling for N_Access_Function_Definition.
	(Analyze_Subtype_Declaration): Modify the text of error message.
	(Derived_Type_Declaration): Modify the text of error message.
	(Process_Subtype): Modify the text of error message plus cleanup
	of one redundant error message.
	(Analyze_Component_Declaration): Code cleanup.
	(Analyze_Object_Declaration): Code cleanup.
	(Analyze_Subtype_Declaration): Propagate the null-exclusion
	attribute in case of access types. Code cleanup.
	(Array_Type_Declaration): Code cleanup.
	(Process_Discriminants): Create the new null-excluding itype
	if required. Code cleanup.
	(Process_Subtype): Create the new null-excluding itype if
	required. Code cleanup.
	(Build_Derived_Record_Type): Code cleanup to avoid calling
	twice the subprogram derive_subprograms in case of private
	types that implement interfaces. In this particular case the
	subprogram Complete_Subprograms_Derivation already does the
	job associated with the second call.

        * exp_strm.adb (Build_Elementary_Input_Call): Add an explicit
        conversion to the full view when generating an operation for a
        discriminant whose type may currently be private.

2005-09-01  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>
	    Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch4.adb (Transform_Object_Operation): In a context off the form
	V (Obj.F), the rewriting does not involve the indexed component, but
	only the selected component itself.
	Do not apply the transformation if the analyzed node is an actual of a
	call to another subprogram.
	(Complete_Object_Operation): Retain the entity of the
	dispatching operation in the selector of the rewritten node. The
	entity will be used in the expansion of dispatching selects.
	(Analyze_One_Call): Improve location of the error message associated
	with interface.
	(Analyze_Selected_Component): No need to resolve prefix when it is a
	function call, resolution is done when parent node is resolved, as
	usual.
	(Analyze_One_Call): Add a flag to suppress analysis of the first actual,
	when attempting to resolve a call transformed from its object notation.
	(Try_Object_Operation, Transform_Object_Operastion): Avoid makind copies
	of the argument list for each interpretation of the operation.
	(Try_Object_Operation): The designated type of an access parameter may
	be an incomplete type obtained through a limited_with clause, in which
	case the primitive operations of the type are retrieved from its full
	view.
	(Analyze_Call): If this is an indirect call, and the return type of the
	access_to_subprogram is incomplete, use its full view if available.

2005-09-01  Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>
	    Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch6.ads, sem_ch6.adb (Check_Conformance): In case of anonymous
	access types the null-exclusion and access-to-constant attributes must
	also match.
	(Analyze_Return_Statement): When the result type is an anonymous access
	type, apply a conversion of the return expression to the access type
	to ensure that appropriate accessibility checks are performed.
	(Analyze_Return_Type): For the case of an anonymous access result type,
	generate the Itype and set Is_Local_Anonymous_Access on the type.
	Add ??? placeholder for check to disallow returning a limited object
	in Ada 2005 unless it's an aggregate or a result of a function call.
	Change calls from Subtype_Mark to Result_Definition.
	(Analyze_Subprogram_Body): Change formal Subtype_Mark to
	Result_Definition in call to Make_Function_Specification.
	(Build_Body_To_Inline): Change Set_Subtype_Mark to
	Set_Result_Definition.
	(Make_Inequality_Operator): Change formal Subtype_Mark to
	Result_Definition in call to Make_Function_Specification.
	(Process_Formals): Create the new null-excluding itype if required.
	(New_Overloaded_Entity): For an entity overriding an interface primitive
	check if the entity also covers other abstract subprograms in the same
	scope. This is required to handle the general case, that is, overriding
	other interface primitives and overriding abstract subprograms inherited
	from some abstract ancestor type.
	(New_Overloaded_Entity): For an overriding entity that comes from
	source, note the operation that it overrides.
	(Check_Conformance, Type_Conformant): Addition of one new formal
	to skip controlling formals in the analysis. This is used to
	handle overloading of abstract interfaces.
	(Base_Types_Match): Add missing case for types imported from
	limited-with clauses
	(New_Overloaded_Entity): Add barrier to protect the use of
	the "alias" attribute.

	* sem_ch8.adb (Analyze_Renamed_Entry): For a renaming_as_declaration,
	verify that the procedure and the entry are mode conformant.
	(Analyze_Subprogram_Renaming): Emit a warning if an operator is renamed
	as a different operator, which is often a cut-and-paste error.

	    Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_disp.adb (Check_Controlling_Formals): Anonymous access types
	used in controlling parameters exclude null because it is necessary to
	read the tag to dispatch, and null has no tag.
	(Override_Dispatching_Operation): If the previous operation is inherited
	from an interface, it becomes hidden  and does not participate in later
	name resolution.

	    Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* sem_res.adb (Resolve_Membership_Op): In case of the membership test
	"Iface_CW_Typ in T'Class" we have nothing else to do in the frontend;
	the expander will generate the corresponding run-time check to evaluate
	the expression.
	(Resolve_Call): Check for legal type of procedure name or prefix that
	appears as a trigger in a triggering alternative.
	(Valid_Conversion): If expression is ambiguous and the context involves
	an extension of System, remove System.Address interpretations.
	(Resolve_Qualified_Expression): Reject the case of a specific-type
	qualification applied to a class-wide argument. Enhance comment
	to explain checking of Original_Node.
	(Resolve_Type_Conversion): The location of the error message was not
	general enough to handle the general case and hence it has been removed.
	In addition, this patch improves the text of the message.
	(Resolve_Type_Conversion): Add missing support for access to interface
	types.
	(Resolve_Type_Conversion): If the target is a class-wide interface type,
	do not expand if the expression is the actual in a call, because proper
	expansion will take place when the call itself is expanded.
	(Resolve_Allocator): If the context is an unchecked conversion, the
	allocator inherits its storage pool, if any, from the target type of
	the conversion.

	    Javier Miranda  <miranda@adacore.com>

	* sem_type.adb (Add_One_Interp): If a candidate operation is an
	inherited interface operation that has an implementation, use the
	implementation to avoid spurious ambiguities.
	(Interface_Present_In_Ancestor): In case of concurrent types we can't
	use the Corresponding_Record_Typ attribute to look for the interface
	because it is set by the expander (and hence it is not always
	available). For this reason we traverse the list of interfaces
	(available in the parent of the concurrent type).
	(Interface_Present_In_Ancestor): Handle entities from the limited view

2005-09-01  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_util.ads, sem_util.adb (Gather_Components): Omit interface tags
	from the list of required components.
	(Is_Controlling_Limited_Procedure): Determine whether an entity is a
	primitive procedure of a limited interface with a controlling first
	parameter.
	(Is_Renamed_Entry): Determine whether an entry is a procedure renaming
	of an entry.
	(Safe_To_Capture_Value): A value (such as non_null) is not safe to
	capture if it is generated in the second operand of a short-circuit
	operation.
	Do not capture values for variables with address clauses.
	(Is_Object_Reference): Treat a function call as an object reference only
	if its type is not Standard_Void_Type.

2005-09-01  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_warn.adb (Warn_On_Known_Condition): Refine warning when applied

	* s-osinte-mingw.ads (pCRITICAL_SECTION): Remove this type which is no
	longer needed.

	set the environment task mask here.
	(Current_State): Add this function that returns the state of the
	suspension object.
	(Set_False): Add this procedure that sets the state of the suspension
	object to False.

	Must_Override and Must_Not_Override, to better express intent of AI.

	such discriminants have their accessibility level defined in the same
	way as a normal component of an anonymous access type.
	(Resolve_Allocator): When an allocator's designated type is a class-wide

	constant-folded, there is nothing to check.
	(Resolve_Comparison_Op, Resolve_Equality_Op, Resolve_Boolean_Op): Defer
	check on possible violation of restriction No_Direct_Boolean_Operators

	(Task_Body_Procedure): New subprogram to read this attribute.
	(Set_Task_Body_Procedure): New subprogram to set this attribute.
	(Has_Controlled_Component): Now applies to all entities.
	This is only a documentation change, since it always worked to apply
	this to other than composite types (yielding false), but now this is
	official.
	Update documentation on Must_Be_Byte_Aligned for new spec

	* tbuild.adb, exp_dist.adb, exp_disp.adb, exp_ch3.ads, exp_ch3.adb,
	exp_attr.adb, exp_aggr.adb, exp_ch4.adb, exp_ch5.adb: Upgrade all the
	uses of the Access_Disp_Table attribute to reference the first dispatch
	table associated with a tagged type. As
	part of the implementation of abstract interface types,
	Access_Disp_Table has been redefined to contain a list of dispatch
	tables (rather than a single dispatch table).
	Similarly, upgrade all the references to Tag_Component by the
	new attribute First_Tag_Component.

	Clean up test in Expand_N_Object_Declaration for cases
	where we need to do a separate assignment of the initial value.
	(Expand_N_Object_Declaration): If the expression in the
	declaration of a tagged type is an aggregate, no need to generate an
	additional tag assignment.
	(Freeze_Type): Now a function that returns True if the N_Freeze_Entity
	is to be deleted.
	Bit packed array ops are only called if operands are known to be
	aligned.

	determine the amount of data to be copied.

	* par.adb (P_Interface_Type_Definition): New subprogram that parses the
	new syntax rule of Ada 2005 interfaces (for AI-251 and AI-345):
	    INTERFACE_TYPE_DEFINITION ::=
	      [limited | task | protected | synchronized] interface

	record type definition and
	derived type definition nodes.
	(Synchronized_Present, Set_Synchronized_Present): New subprograms.
	(Task_Present, Set_Task_Present): New subprogram.
	(Task_Body_Procedure): Removed.
	(Set_Task_Body_Procedure): Removed.
	These subprogram have been removed because the attribute
	Task_Body_Procedure has been moved to the corresponding task type
	or task subtype entity to leave a field free to store the list
	of interfaces implemented by a task (for AI-345)
	Add Expression field to N_Raise_Statement node for Ada 2005 AI-361
	(Null_Exclusion_Present): Change to Flag11, to avoid conflict with

	(Box_Present, Default_Name, Specification, Set_Box_Present,
	Set_Default_Name, Set_Specification): Expand the expression

	attribute Task_Body_Procedure rather than the old semantic field that
	was available in the task_type_declaration node.

	* par-ch12.adb (P_Formal_Type_Definition): Modified to handle formal
	interface type definitions.
	(P_Formal_Derived_Type_Definition): Modified to handle the list of

	inside the parent.
	(gnat_to_gnu_entity) <E_Record_Type>: Fix typo in the alignment formula
	(gnat_to_gnu_entity) <E_Variable>: Do not convert again the
	expression to the type of the object when the object is constant.
	Reverse defer_debug_incomplete_list before traversing it, so that trees

	order is important when using the stabs debug format.
	If we are deferring the output of debug information, also defer this

	When adding fields to a record, prevent emitting debug information
	for incomplete records, emit the information only when the record is

	N_Qualified_Expression.

	* sem_ch3.adb (Derived_Type_Declaration): New predicate
	Comes_From_Generic, to recognize accurately that the parent type in a

	that come from packed arrays).
	(Expand_Inlined_Call): If the subprogram is a renaming as body, and the

	improving the quality of code that depends on this test.

	* exp_util.adb (Kill_Dead_Code): For a package declaration, iterate
	over both visible and private declarations to remove them from tree,
	and mark subprograms declared in package as eliminated, to prevent
	spurious use in subsequent compilation of generic units in the context.

	here from exp_attr so it can be shared between exp_attr and exp_dist.
	(TSS_Names): Renamed from OK_TSS_Names. This array contains the list of
	all TSS names, not a subset thereof, and the previous name introduced
	an unnecessarily confusion that a distinction might exist between
	"OK" TSS names and some "not OK" TSS names.

	This change works fine when gnatlib is built from the gcc directory,

	(Note_Possible_Modification): If an entity name has no entity, return.

	Currently we don't permit this, but this is under discussion by the
	ARG, and it is easy enough to use a different example.

	* s-wchcon.ads, s-wchcnv.ads, s-wchcnv.adb: Add new subprograms for

	describing the new layout.
	(Dispatch_Table): The expander computes the actual array size, allocates

	subprogram only if inner one comes from source.
	(Analyze_Function_Call): If the call is given in object notation, the

	the calls.

	    Arnaud Charlet <charlet@adacore.com>

	* init.c (__gnat_initialize): Add a new parameter eh which contains the
	address of the exception registration. The Win32 version of this
	routine calls __gnat_install_SEH_handler() to initialize the SEH
	(Structured Exception Handling) handler.
	(__gnat_error_handler) [Win32]: Removed. Not needed as we use
	SEH (Structured Exception Handling) now.
	(__gnat_install_handler) [Win32]: Nothing to do now as we use SEH.
	(__gnat_initialize for ppc-vxworks): Adjust comments and the
	preprocessor condition protecting the call to the extra eh setup
	subprogram, which is only available for the ppc target.
	(__gnat_clear_exception_count): replaced reference to
	variable taskIdCurrent by call to taskIdSelf(), cleaner.

	* seh_init.c: New file.

	routine takes a new parameter (a pointer to the exception registration
	for the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) support.

	* raise.h: (__gnat_install_SEH_handler): New prototype.
	Update copyright notice.

	* s-tassta.adb (Task_Wrapper): Declare the exception registration

	* make.adb (Gnatmake): Do not fail when the main project has no object
	directory.

2005-02-09  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch4.adb (Analyze_Selected_Component): Create Actual_Subtype even
	with expansion disabled. The actual subtype is needed among other
	places when the selected component appears in the context of a loop
	bound, and denotes a packed array.
	(Operator_Check): Always use the first subtype in the
	error message, to avoid the appearance of internal base types.
	(Transform_Object_Operation): Copy each actual in full
	to the parameter associations of the constructed call, rather than
	using the shallow copy mechanism of New_Copy_List. This ensures that
	the chaining of named associations is done properly.
	(Complete_Object_Operation): Rewrite node, rather than
	replacing it, so that we can trace back to the original selected
	component.

	* sem_elab.adb (Set_Elaboration_Constraint): For initialization calls,
	and calls that use object notation, if the called function is not
	declared  in a withed unit, place the elaboration constraint on the
	unit in the context that makes the function accessible.

	imposes an elaboration constraint between two packages.

2005-02-09  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch7.adb (Uninstall_Declarations): Exchange full and private
	views of a private type after handling its private dependents, to

	Slight fix to documentation of -gnaty with no parameters

	* xr_tabls.ads: Add ??? comment for missing overall comment

	* xsinfo.adb: Make default file name be sinfo.h, since this is what
	we now use by default.

	the difference between compact and incompact layout and add the record
	representation clause to the example illustrating different layouts.
	Add the description of '-A5' gnatpp option ("align 'AT' keywords in
	component clauses").

2005-02-09  Florian Villoing  <villoing@adacore.com>

	* gnat_ugn.texi: Fix typos.
	Use @command to display 'gcc', 'gnatbind', etc. insted of @code or
	@file.
	Make proper use of @ref, @xref and @pxref to avoid duplication of "see"
	in the generated documentation.

	from the VxWorks kernel) that is needed for getting the active
	priority of the different tasks.

	TYPE_SIZE_UNIT of result type if SIZE is not specified.

	* sem_util.adb (Insert_Explicit_Dereference): When an implicit
	dereference is rewritten to an explicit one, generate a reference to
	the entity denoted by its prefix using the original prefix node, so

	emitting 'assigned but never read' warning on a variable on the basis
	that it has an access type.

	subprogram which is Imported with convention Intrinsic if an
	External_Name argument is specified.

	(Add_Stub_Type): Rewrite to isolate the parts that are specific to one
	implementation of the partition communication subsystem in ancillary
	subprograms.
	(Specific_Build_Stub_Type, GARLIC_Support.Build_Stub_Type,
	PolyORB_Support.Build_Stub_Type): New subrograms containing the

	ensure proper recording of references.

2004-12-07  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	attributes for the current entity and propagate first subtype
	attributes to other subtypes.
	<E_Procedure>: Attribute arguments are attr->args and not
	attr->arg any more.
	(build_attr_list): Ditto. Make attr->args a TREE_LIST when there is an
	argument provided, as this is what GCC expects. Use NULL_TREE instead
	of 0 for trees.

	procedures factors the common processing for building an RPC receiver
	for an RCI package or an RACW type.
	Stylistic cleanup: change '/= Empty' to 'Present ()'; move body of
	Build_Remote_Subprogram_Proxy_Type into proper alphabetical order.

	(Add_RAS_Access_TSS): Correct the setting of the Etype of the
	RAS_Access TSS.
	(Get_Pkg_Name_String): Remove subprogram. Usage occurrences are
	replaced with calls to Get_Library_Unit_Name_String. Previously there
	were several instances of the same code in different locations in the

	* exp_prag.adb: (Expand_Pragma_Common_Object): New procedure
	(Expand_Pragma_Psect_Object): New procedure
	These procedures contain the revised and cleaned up processing for
	these two pragmas. This processing was formerly in Sem_Prag, but
	is more appropriately moved here. The cleanup involves making sure
	that the pragmas are properly attached to the tree, and that no
	nodes are improperly shared.

	* sem_prag.adb: Move expansion of Common_Object and Psect_Object
	pragmas to Exp_Prag, which is more appropriate.
	Attach these two pragmas to the Rep_Item chain Use Rep_Item chain to
	check for duplicates Remove use of Is_Psected flag, no longer needed.
	Use new Make_String_Literal function with string.

	* exp_attr.adb (Expand_Fpt_Attribute): The floating-point attributes
	that are functions return universal values, that have to be converted
	to the context type.
	Use new Make_String_Literal function with string.
	(Get_Stream_Convert_Pragma): New function, replaces the use of
	Get_Rep_Pragma, which had to be kludged to work in this case.

	* freeze.adb: Use new Has_Rep_Pragma function

	* exp_intr.adb, exp_ch3.adb, sem_attr.adb: Use new Make_String_Literal
	function with string.

2004-11-18  Robert Dewar  <dewar@adacore.com>

	* errout.ads, errout.adb: (First_Sloc): New function

	* par-ch5.adb (P_Condition): Check for redundant parens is now a style
	check (-gnatyx) instead of being included as a redundant construct
	warning.

	* sem_ch6.adb: Change name Style_Check_Subprogram_Order to
	Style_Check_Order_Subprograms.

	* style.ads, styleg.ads, styleg.adb, styleg-c.adb, stylesw.ads,
	stylesw.adb: Add Style_Check_Xtra_Parens

	* vms_data.ads: Add entry for STYLE_CHECKS=XTRA_PARENS => -gnatyx

2004-11-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>
	    Robert Dewar  <dewar@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch4.adb (Expand_N_Selected_Component): If the component is the
	discriminant of a constrained subtype, analyze the copy of the
	corresponding constraint, because in some cases it may be only
	partially analyzed.
	Removes long-lived ??? comments.

	* exp_ch7.adb (Establish_Transient_Scope): Remove complex code that
	handled controlled or secondary-stack expressions within the
	iteration_scheme of a loop.

	* sem_ch5.adb (Analyze_Iteration_Scheme): Build a block to evaluate
	bounds that may contain functions calls, to prevent memory leaks when
	the bound contains a call to a function that uses the secondary stack.
	(Check_Complex_Bounds): Subsidiary of Analyze_Iteration_Scheme, to
	generate temporaries for loop bounds that might contain function calls
	that require secondary stack and/or finalization actions.

	* sem_ch4.adb (Analyze_Indexed_Component_Form): If the prefix is a
	selected component and the selector is overloadable (not just a
	function) treat as function call, Analyze_Call will disambiguate if
	necessary.
	(Analyze_Selected_Component): Do not generate an actual subtype for the
	selected component if expansion is disabled. The actual subtype is only
	needed for constraint checks.
	(Analyze_Allocator): If restriction No_Streams is set, then do
	not permit objects to be declared of a stream type, or of a
	composite type containing a stream.

	* restrict.ads: Remove the a-stream entry from Unit_Array, since
	No_Streams no longer prohibits with'ing this package.

	* sem_ch3.adb (Build_Derived_Record_Type): If the parent type has
	discriminants, but the parent base has unknown discriminants, there is
	no discriminant constraint to inherit. Such a discrepancy can arise
	when the actual for a formal type with unknown discriminants is a
	similar private type whose full view has discriminants.
	(Analyze_Object_Declaration): If restriction No_Streams is set, then
	do not permit objects to be declared of a stream type, or of a
	composite type containing a stream.

2004-11-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* exp_dbug.ads: Update documentation to reflect simpler encoding for
	protected operations.

	* exp_ch9.adb (Build_Selected_Name): Do not include "PT" suffix in
	generated name, it complicates decoding in gdb and hinders debugging
	of protected operations.
	(Build_Barrier_Function_Specification): Set the Needs_Debug_Info
	flag for the protected entry barrier function.
	(Build_Protected_Entry_Specification): Set the Needs_Debug_Info
	flag for the protected entry function.

2004-11-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* exp_pakd.adb (Convert_To_PAT_Type): After replacing the original
	type of the object with the packed array type, set the Analyzed flag
	on the object if it is an entity or simple indexed component, to avoid
	spurious type errors.

2004-11-18  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* gnat1drv.adb, gnatbind.adb, gnatchop.adb, gnatfind.adb, gnatlink.adb,
	gnatls.adb, gnatxref.adb, gprep.adb: Output the copyright message on a
	separate line from the version message.

2004-11-18  Ed Falis  <falis@adacore.com>

	* init.c (__gnat_map_signal): map SIGSEGV to Storage_Error for AE653
	vthreads.

	AE653. The instructions have no effect for vThreads.

2004-11-18  Vincent Celier  <celier@adacore.com>

	* make.adb (Gnatmake): Invoke gnatlink with -shared-libgcc when
	gnatbind is invoked with -shared.

2004-11-18  Jose Ruiz  <ruiz@adacore.com>

	* s-tposen.adb (Lock_Entry): Remove the code for raising Program_Error
	for Detect_Blocking which is redundant with the check done within the
	procedure Protected_Single_Entry_Call.
	(Lock_Read_Only_Entry): Remove the code for raising Program_Error for
	Detect_Blocking which is redundant with the check done within the
	procedure Protected_Single_Entry_Call.

2004-11-18  Vincent Celier  <celier@adacore.com>

	* makegpr.adb (Compile): Put the compiling switches (in package
	Compiler and on the command line) immediately after "-c", instead of
	at the end of the command line invocation of the compiler, when
	compiling a non-Ada file.
	(Build_Global_Archive): When there is no need to rebuild the archive,
	set Global_Archive_Exists, so that the archive is passed to the linker
	if one is needed.

2004-11-18  Robert Dewar  <dewar@adacore.com>
	    Sergey Rybin  <rybin@adacore.com>

	* gnat_ugn.texi:
	Remove extra paren check from list of checks for redundant constructs
	Add documentation of new -gnatyx style check (check extra parens)
	Remove paragraph about gnatelim debug options.

	* gnat_rm.texi: Document that Ada.Streams now forbids creating stream
	objects rather than forbidding dependencies on the package Ada.Streams.

	* sinfo.ads: Add ??? note that we should document pragmas passed to
	back end.

	* g-socthi-vms.adb, g-socthi-mingw.adb, g-socthi-vxworks.ads:
	(C_Writev): Change MSG_Forced_Flags to Constants.MSG_Forced_Flags as
	there is no use of GNAT.Sockets.Constants.
	Remove remaining pragma Import for C_Write
	Remove C_Read and C_Write from internal implementation unit
	GNAT.Sockets.Thin, as their usage for sockets is non-portable (using
	the read and write functions from the system runtime library is fine
	on UNIX but won't work under Windows).

	* g-socket.adb: (Abort_Selector): Use C_Send instead of C_Write.
	(Check_Selector): Use C_Recv instead of C_Read.
	Selectors are the GNAT.Sockets abstraction to perform a select()
	call on a set of descriptors. To allow abortion of an ongoing
	select operation, some data is written to a dedicated socket that
	is always monitored.
	Under Windows, the write and read library functions cannot operate
	on sockets, so we need to use send and recv instead, which is portable
	across all supported platforms.

	* g-socthi.ads: Remove C_Read and C_Write from internal implementation
	unit GNAT.Sockets.Thin, as their usage for sockets is non-portable
	(using the read and write functions from the system runtime library is
	fine on UNIX but won't work under Windows).

2004-10-26  Nicolas Setton  <setton@act-europe.fr>

	* mlib-tgt-darwin.adb: New file.

	* mlib-tgt-tru64.adb, mlib-tgt-aix.adb, mlib-tgt-irix.adb,

	mlib-tgt-mingw.adb, mlib-tgt-vxworks.adb (Archive_Indexer_Options): New
	subprogram body.

	* Makefile.in: Add support for building shared libraries under Darwin.
	(EXTRA_GNATRTL_NONTASKING_OBJS, ppc-vxworks): Add s-vxwexc.o, containing
	the low level EH init subprogram to be called from __gnat_initialize.

	* mlib-tgt.ads, mlib-tgt.adb (Archive_Indexer_Options): New subprogram,
	indicates which options to pass to the archive indexer.

	* mlib-utl.adb: Add support for calling ranlib with additional
	options. This is needed for instance under Mac OS X.
	(Ranlib_Options): New global variable, used to store the potential
	options to pass to ranlib.
	(Ar): Use Ranlib_Options when spawning ranlib.
	(Initialize): Set the value of ranlib option.

2004-10-26  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>

	* s-parame-linux.adb (Minimum_Stack_Size): Adjust to return 12K
	instead of 8K, to reflect the real potential needs for stack-checking
	in the ZCX case.

2004-10-26  Pascal Obry  <obry@gnat.com>

	* s-parame-mingw.adb (Default_Stack_Size): Add some comments.

	* s-taprop-mingw.adb (Create_Task): Set initial stack size to 1024. On
	Windows only the initial thread stack size can be set so it is good to
	start we a low stack size.
	The OS will adjust the size as needed.

2004-10-26  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>
	    Nicolas Setton  <setton@act-europe.fr>

	* expect.c, adaint.c, link.c, sysdep.c (unix sections): Guard with
	"__unix__" instead of "unix".
	The latter is implicitly defined by gcc3.2 but not by gcc >= 3.4, so the
	sections were just mistakenly ignored. The former is
	implicitely defined by gcc2.8, gcc3.2 and gcc3.4.
	Update #ifdef preprocessor macro to detect the symbol __hpux__ instead
	of hpux. This prevents an unwanted definition of the symbol
	convert_addresses in adaint.o.

2004-10-26  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@gnat.com>

	* a-exexpr.adb (Setup_Key): Change initial value to 16#DEAD#, for
	compatibility with type Unwind_Word on 16-bit targets such as AAMP.

2004-10-26  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* checks.adb (Expr_Known_Valid): If floating-point validity checks are
	enabled, check the result of unary and binary operations when the
	expression is the right-hand side of an assignment.

2004-10-26  Vincent Celier  <celier@gnat.com>

	* clean.adb (Delete): Do not output warnings when in quiet output and
	not in verbose mode.
	(Force_Deletions): New Boolean flag, defaulted to False
	(Delete): Only delete a file if it is writable, and when
	Force_Deletions is True.
	(Parse_Cmd_Line): New switch -f: set Force_Deletions to True
	(Usage): Line for new switch -f
	(Clean_Directory): Use GNAT.OS_Lib.Set_Writable instead of rolling our
	own.

2004-10-26  Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@act-europe.fr>

	* decl.c (gnat_to_gnu_field): Use the type of the inner object for a
	JM type only if its size matches that of the wrapper.  When a size is
	prescribed and the field is not aliased, remove the wrapper of a JM
	type only if the size is not greater than that of the packed array.
	(gnat_to_gnu_entity): Change the extension of packed array wrappers
	from LJM to JM.

2004-10-26  Geert Bosch  <bosch@gnat.com>

	* exp_aggr.adb (Safe_Component): An aggregate component that is an
	unchecked conversion is safe for in-place use if the expression of the
	conversion is safe.
	(Expand_Array_Aggregate): An aggregate that initializes an allocator may
	be expandable in place even if the aggregate does not come from source.
	(Convert_Array_Aggr_In_Allocator): New procedure to initialize the
	designated object of an allocator in place, rather than building it
	first on the stack. The previous scheme forces a full copy of the array,
	and may be altogether unsusable if the size of the array is too large
	for stack allocation.

2004-10-26  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* exp_ch4.adb (Expand_N_Op_Eq): Make sure we expand a loop for array
	compares if the component is atomic.

	* exp_ch5.adb (Expand_Assign_Array): Make sure we expand a loop for
	array assignment if the component type is atomic.

2004-10-26  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>
	    Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@act-europe.fr>

	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_Actuals): If the actual for an in-out parameter
	is aliased and is a by_reference type, do not pass by copy.
	(Expand_N_Function_Call) <Rhs_Of_Assign_Or_Decl>: New function to
	detect whether the call is in the right side of an assignment or
	the expression of an object declaration.  Recurse on component
	association within aggregates.
	Call it in the condition that determines whether the temporary is
	necessary for correct stack-checking.

2004-10-26  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* exp_dist.adb (Build_General_Calling_Stubs): New formal parameter
	RACW_Type, used in the PolyORB version.
	Rename RCI_Info to RCI_Locator, for consistency between the PolyORB
	version and the GARLIC version.

	* snames.ads, snames.adb, s-parint.ads, s-parint.adb:
	Rename RCI_Info to RCI_Locator for better consistency between the
	GARLIC and PolyORB versions of the distributed systems annex.
	(DSA_Implementation_Name): This enumeration lists the possible
	implementations of the Partition Communication Subsystem for the
	Distributed Systems Annex (DSA). The three available implementations
	are the dummy stub implementation (No_DSA), and two versions based on
	two different distribution runtime libraries: GARLIC and PolyORB. Both
	the GARLIC PCS and the PolyORB PCS are part of the GLADE distribution
	technology.
	Change the literal GLADE_DSA to GARLIC_DSA to accurately describe
	that organization.

	* rtsfind.ads: Rename RCI_Info to RCI_Locator for better consistency
	between the GARLIC and PolyORB versions of the distributed systems
	annex.
	Remove RE_Unbounded_Reclaim_Pool since it is unused.

	Set_Read_Only): New subprograms.
	These new routines allow the user to set or unset the Owner execute
	and Owner write permission flags on a file.

	* makegpr.adb, mlib.adb, mlib-prj.adb: Use
	GNAT.OS_Lib.Set_Executable instead of rolling our own.

2004-10-26  Matthew Gingell  <gingell@gnat.com>

	* i-cpp.ads, i-cpp.adb: Change layout of VTable for new C++ ABI.

2004-10-26  Pascal Obry  <obry@gnat.com>

	* init.c (__gnat_error_handler) [Win32]: Instead of trying to read the
	memory before the faulting page we properly test the process read
	access for this address using appropriate Win32 routine.
	(HPUX sections): guard with "__hpux__" instead of "hpux".

2004-10-26  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* lib-xref.adb (Generate_Reference): Don't complain about reference to
	entry parameter if pragma Unreferenced set, since we do not properly
	handle the case of multiple parameters.

2004-10-26  Vincent Celier  <celier@gnat.com>

	* prj-env.adb: (Contains_ALI_Files): New Boolean function
	(Ada_Objects_Path.Add): For a library project, add to the object path

	that is virtually extended.

	* prj-proc.adb (Imported_Or_Extended_Project_From): If a project with
	the specified name is directly imported, return its ID. Otherwise, if
	an extension of this project is imported, return the ID of the
	extension.

	current instance appears within a unit that is directly in the context
	of the main unit.
	Used to determine whether the body of the instance should be analyzed
	immediately after its spec, to make its subprogram bodies available
	for front-end inlining.
	(Analyze_Formal_Array_Type): Cleanup condition that checks that range
	constraint is not allowed on the component type (AARM 12.5.3(3))

	corresponding record type if the subtype declaration has no
	discriminant constraints. This can be the case in source code, or in
	the subtype declaration created to rename an actual type within an
	instantiation.

2004-10-26  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_ch6.adb (Analyze_Subprogram_Body): If body is a subunit for a
	different kind of stub (possibly wrong name for file), do not check
	for conformance.
	(Uses_Secondary_Stack): New subsidiary to Build_Body_To_Inline. If body
	includes call to some function that returns an unconstrained type, do
	not inline.

2004-10-26  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_elab.adb (Check_Elab_Call): Do not check a call that does not
	appear in the code for the main unit. Dependencies among units in the
	context of the main unit are established when those other units are
	compiled. Otherwise spurious elaboration constraints can generate
	incorrect elaboration circularities.

2004-10-26  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>
	    Ed Schonberg   <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_util.adb (Is_Aliased_View): Defend against the case where this
	subprogram is called with a parameter that is not an object name. This
	situation arises for some cases of illegal code, which is diagnosed
	later, and in this case it is wrong to call Is_Aliased, as that might
	cause a compiler crash.
	(Explain_Limited_Type): Refine previous fix to include
	inherited components of derived types, to provide complete information.

	* exp_ch9.adb (Set_Privals): Set the Ekind of the actual object that
	is the prival for a protected object.
	It is necessary to mark this entity as a variable, in addition to
	flagging it as Aliased, because Sem_Util.Is_Aliased_View has been
	modified to avoid checking the Aliased flag on entities that are not
	objects. (Checking that flag for non-objects is erroneous and could
	lead to a compiler crash).

2004-10-26  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* s-fatgen.adb (Pred): Fix redundant test for X > 0.0, since if
	X_Frac = 0.5, then we know that the number X must be positive.
	(Succ): Remove the same redundant test, and also fix the primary test
	to test for X_Frac = -0.5 (used to be 0.5) which is clearly wrong.
	Minor reformatting
	(Decompose): Add fuller comments to spec

2004-10-26  Pascal Obry  <obry@gnat.com>

	* tracebak.c (IS_BAD_PTR): Use IsBadCodePtr on Win32 to check for ptr
	validity (process must have read access). Set to 0 in all other cases.
	(STOP_FRAME): Now check for ptr validity to avoid a segmentation
	violation on Win32.
	(VALID_STACK_FRAME): Check for ptr validity on Win32 to avoid a
	segmentation violation.

2004-10-26  Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@act-europe.fr>

	* trans.c (call_to_gnu): For an (in-)out parameter passed by reference
	whose type is a constructed subtype of an aliased object with an
	unconstrained nominal subtype, convert the actual to the constructed
	subtype before taking its address.

2004-10-26  Vincent Celier  <celier@gnat.com>

	* a-dirval.ads, a-dirval.adb, a-dirval-vms.adb, a-dirval-mingw.adb
	(Is_Path_Name_Case_Sensitive): New function

	* a-direct.adb (To_Lower_If_Case_Insensitive): New procedure
	(Base_Name, Simple_Name, Current_Directory, Compose,
	Containing_Directory, Full_Name): Call To_Lower_If_Case_Insensitive on
	the result.

2004-10-26  Cyrille Comar    <comar@act-europe.fr>
	    Vasiliy Fofanov  <fofanov@act-europe.fr>
	    Vincent Celier   <celier@gnat.com>

	* gnat_ugn.texi: Generalize "finding memory problems" section into a
	"memory management issues" section and document some of the useful
	memory pools provided as part of the GNAT library.
	Remove "virtual" from declaration of A::method2 in
	the simple example of Ada/C++ mixed system.
	Library Projects may be virtually extended: their virtual extensions
	are not Library Projects.
	Added section on extending project hierarchies.

2004-10-19  Aaron W. LaFramboise  <aaronavay62@aaronwl.com>

	* adaint.c (__gnat_get_libraries_from_registry): Cast value
	to LPBYTE.
	(__gnat_portable_spawn): Remove const.

	* mingw32.h (MAXPATHLEN): Check for previous definition.

2004-10-17  Matthias Klose  <doko@debian.org>

	* gnatvsn.ads: Set gnat library version to 4.0.

2004-10-05  Vincent Celier  <celier@gnat.com>

	* Makefile.in: Define and use RANLIB_FLAGS.

2004-10-04  Pascal Obry  <obry@gnat.com>

	* tracebak.c: Always set LOWEST_ADDR to 0 on Win32 (as done on all
	other x86 platforms).

2004-10-04  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>

	* s-tassta.adb (Task_Wrapper): Make it Convention C, which makes sense
	in general and triggers stack alignment adjustment for thread entry
	points on targets where this is necessary.

2004-10-04  Bernard Banner  <banner@gnat.com>

	PR ada/13897

	* Makefile.in: Add section for powerpc linux
	Add variant i-vxwork-x86.ads

	* i-vxwork-x86.ads, system-linux-ppc.ads: New files.

2004-10-04  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>

	* init.c (__gnat_initialize): Call an Ada subprogram to perform the
	table registration calls when need be. Ensures no reference to the crt
	ctors symbol are issued in the SJLJ case, which avoids possible
	undefined symbol errors in the case of modules to be statically linked
	with the kernel.

2004-10-04  Javier Miranda  <miranda@gnat.com>

	* sem_ch4.adb (Try_Object_Operation): Reformat the code to expand
	in-line the code corresponding to subprogram Analyze_Actuals. In
	addition, analyze the actuals only in case of subprogram call.

2004-10-04  Ed Falis  <falis@gnat.com>

	* s-vxwork-x86.ads: (FP_CONTEXT): Defined to be correct size

	IF and CASE.
	(Analyze_Block_Statement): Add circuitry to detect following dead code
	(Check_Unreachable_Code): Handle case of block exit

2004-10-04  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* g-spipat.adb: (XMatch): Avoid warning for Logic_Error call
	(XMatchD): Avoid warning for Logic_Error call

2004-10-04  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* exp_ch4.adb (Is_Procedure_Actual): Correct so that this does not
	consider expressions buried within a procedure actual to be an actual.
	This caused some blowups with uses of packed slices within a procedure
	actual.

2004-10-04  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* exp_ch3.adb (Needs_Simple_Initialization): Modular packed arrays no
	longer need to be initialized to zero.
	(Get_Simple_Init_Val): Modular packed arrays no longer need to be
	initialized to zero.

	* checks.adb (Expr_Known_Valid): Packed arrays are now always
	considered valid, even if the representation is modular. That's correct
	now that we no longer initialize packed modular arrays to zero.

	* exp_dbug.ads: Clarify documentation on handling of PAD and JM
	suffixes. These are now documented as the only cases in which the
	debugger ignores outer records.
	Previously, the spec allowed arbitrary suffixes for this purpose.
	Change name of LJM to JM for packed array pad records
	Create separate section on packed array handling, and add a whole new
	set of comments to this section describing the situation with packed
	modular types and justification requirements depending on endianness.

2004-10-04  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* a-except.adb: Add a comment for last change

2004-10-04  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_ch6.adb (Analyze_Subprogram_Body): Do not treat Inline as
	Inline_Always when in Configurable_Run_Time mode.

	* sem_prag.adb (Process_Convention): If entity is an inherited
	subprogram, apply convention to parent subprogram if in same scope.
	(Analyze_Pragma, case Inline): Do not treat Inline as Inline_Always
	when in Configurable_Run_Time mode.

2004-10-04  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_ch3.adb (Build_Derived_Record_Type): Set First/Last entity of
	class_wide type after component list has been inherited.

2004-10-04  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_ch12.adb (Check_Generic_Actuals): New predicate
	Denotes_Previous_Actual, to handle properly the case of a private
	actual that is also the component type of a subsequent array actual.
	The visibility status of the first actual is not affected when the
	second is installed.
	(Process_Nested_Formal): Subsidiary of Instantiate_Formal_Package, to
	make fully recursive the treatment of formals of packages declared
	with a box.
	(Restore_Nested_Formal): Subsidiary of Restore_Private_Views, to undo
	the above on exit from an instantiation.
	(Denotes_Formal_Package): When called from Restore_Private_Views, ignore
	current instantiation which is now complete.
	(Analyze_Package_Instantiation): No instantiated body is needed if the
	main unit is generic. Efficient, and avoid anomalies when a instance
	appears in a package accessed through rtsfind.

2004-10-04  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_N_Function_Call): If stack checking is enabled,
	do not generate a declaration for a temporary if the call is part of a
	library-level instantiation.

2004-10-04  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* sem_util.adb (Explain_Limited_Type): Ignore internal components when
	searching for a limited component to flag.

	* exp_attr.adb (Freeze_Stream_Subprogram): Subsidiary procedure to
	expansion of Input, to account for the fact that the implicit call
	generated by the attribute reference must freeze the user-defined
	stream subprogram. This is only relevant to 'Input, because it can
	appear in an object declaration, prior to the body of the subprogram.

	* sem_ch13.adb (Rep_Item_Too_Late): Make the error non-serious, so that
	expansion can proceed and further errors uncovered.
	(Minor clean up): Fix cases of using | instead of \ for continuation
	messages.

2004-10-04  Richard Kenner  <kenner@vlsi1.ultra.nyu.edu>

	* cuintp.c, decl.c, utils2.c: Use gcc_assert and gcc_unreachable.

	* a-dirval-mingw.adb (Invalid_Character): Add '\' as invalid character
	in file name.
	(Is_Valid_Path_Name): Take '/' as a directory separator.

2004-10-04  Vincent Celier  <celier@gnat.com>

	resolved path.
	(Parse_Single_Project): Ditto.

	* prj-env.adb (Set_Ada_Paths.Add.Recursive_Add): Do not call
	Add_To_Project_Path for virtual projects.

	default anymore.

	* makegpr.adb (Get_Imported_Directories.add): Remove trailing
	directory separator, if any.
	(Gprmake): Do not allow mains on the command line for library projects.
	Do not attempt to link when the project is a library project.
	(Library_Opts): New table to store Library_Options.
	(Build_Library): If Library_Options is specified, pass these options
	when building a shared library.

2004-10-04  Jose Ruiz  <ruiz@act-europe.fr>

	by the expander.

2004-10-04  Jose Ruiz  <ruiz@act-europe.fr>

	* targparm.ads, targparm.adb (Targparm_Tags): Add PAS value

	system-mingw.ads, system-vms-zcx.ads, system-vxworks-ppc.ads,
	system-vxworks-alpha.ads: Add the flag Preallocated_Stacks, that is
	used to signal whether the compiler creates the required stacks and
	descriptors for the different tasks (when True) or it is done by the
	underlying operating system at run time (when False).
	It is initially set to False in all targets.

	* exp_ch9.adb (Expand_N_Task_Type_Declaration): Create the task stack
	if it is supported by the target.
	(Make_Task_Create_Call): Pass the stack address if it has been
	previously created. Otherwise pass a Null_Address.

	* snames.adb: Add _stack.

	* snames.ads: Add Name_uStack. Required to allow the expander to
	statically allocated task stacks.

	* s-tarest.ads, s-tarest.adb (Create_Restricted_Task): Add
	Stack_Address argument.

2004-10-04  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* usage.adb: Change "pragma inline" to "pragma Inline" in information
	and error messages

2004-10-04  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* exp_dist.adb: Split declaration of asynchronous flag out of
	Add_RACW_Read_Attribute.
	Minor reformatting for better alignment with PolyORB version.
	Store the entity for the asynchronous flag of an RACW, rather than the
	expression, in the asynchronous flags table. This will allow this flag
	to be used in other subprograms beside Add_RACW_Read_Attribute.

2004-10-04  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* g-socket.ads, g-socket.adb, g-socthi.adb, socket.c,

2004-09-23  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	PR ada/17540

	* sem_prag.adb (Process_Import_Or_Interface): Don't set Is_Public here,

	clause).
	Change "pragma inline" to "pragma Inline" in information and error
	messages.
	Minor reformatting.

	* freeze.adb (Check_Address_Clause): Remove previous change, not the
	right way of doing things after all.
	(Freeze_Entity): For object, set Is_Public for imported entities
	unless there is an address clause present.

2004-09-21  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>

	* decl.c (gnat_to_gnu_entity) <E_General_Access_Type>: Check for a
	dummy designated type via TYPE_MODE instead of COMPLETE_TYPE_P. This
	ensures proper handling of types with rep clauses, which might have
	their TYPE_SIZE set already.

2004-09-21  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	* decl.c (gnat_to_gnu_type, case E_Modular_Integer_Type): Wrap modular
	packed array types in both little- and big-endian cases. This change
	ensures that we no longer count on the unused bits being initialized
	for such types (and in particular ensures that equality testing will
	only read the relevant bits).
	Change name TYPE_LEFT_JUSTIFIED_MODULAR_P to TYPE_JUSTIFIED_MODULAR_P
	These changes mean that we no longer need to initialize small packed
	arrays.
	(gnat_to_gnu_entity) <E_Record_Subtype>: Apply the same
	optimization to an LJM field as to its parent field.

	* ada-tree.h, trans.c, utils.c, utils2.c:
	Change name TYPE_LEFT_JUSTIFIED_MODULAR_P to TYPE_JUSTIFIED_MODULAR_P

2004-09-20  Jan Hubicka  <jh@suse.cz>

	* utils.c (gnat_finalize): Remove.
	(end_subprog_body): Directly call cgraph_finalize_function;
	do not lower the nested functions.

2004-09-20  Robert Dewar  <dewar@gnat.com>

	PR ada/17540

	* freeze.adb (Check_Address_Clause): Reset Is_Imported and Is_Public
	if an address clause is present, since that means that the Import
	should be ignored.

2004-09-20  Arnaud Charlet  <charlet@act-europe.fr>

	* 5tsystem.ads: Removed, no longer used.

2004-09-17  Jeffrey D. Oldham  <oldham@codesourcery.com>

	* prj.ads: (Project_Error): New exception

	* prj-attr.adb: Except in procedure Initialize, Fail comes from
	Prj.Com, not from Osint.
	(Attrs, Package_Attributes): Tables moved to private part of spec
	(Add_Attribute, Add_Unknown_Package): Moved to new child package
	Prj.Attr.PM.
	(Register_New_Package (Name, Attributes), Register_New_Attribute): Raise
	Prj.Project_Error after call to Fail.
	(Register_New_Package (Name, Id)): Set Id to Empty_Package after calling
	Fail. Check that package name is not already in use.

	* prj-attr.ads: Comment updates to indicate that all subprograms may be
	used by tools, not only by the project manager, and to indicate that
	exception Prj.Prj_Error may be raised in case of problem.
	(Add_Unknown_Package, Add_Attribute): Moved to new child package
	Prj.Attr.PM.
	(Attrs, Package_Attributes): Table instantiations moved from the body to
	the private part to be accessible from Prj.Attr.PM body.

	(Unlock): When pragma Detect_Blocking is active decrease the protected
	action nesting level.

	* s-taskin.adb (Initialize_ATCB): Initialize to 0 the
	Protected_Action_Nesting.

	* s-taskin.ads: Adding the field Protected_Action_Nesting to the
	Common_ATCB record. It contains the dynamic level of protected action
	nesting for each task. It is needed for checking whether potentially
	blocking operations are called from protected operations.
	(Detect_Blocking): Adding a Boolean constant reflecting whether pragma

	(Timed_Task_Entry_Call): When pragma Detect_Blocking is active, raise
	Program_Error if called from a protected operation.

	* s-tassta.adb (Abort_Tasks): When pragma Detect_Blocking is active,
	raise Program_Error if called from a protected operation.

	* s-tpoben.adb (Lock_Entries): When pragma Detect_Blocking is active,
	raise Program_Error if called from a protected operation, and increase
	the protected action nesting level.
	(Lock_Read_Only_Entries): When pragma Detect_Blocking is active, raise

	insertion of the statement raising Program_Error. The run time
	contains the required machinery for handling that.

	* sem_util.ads: Change comment associated to procedure
	Check_Potentially_Blocking_Operation.
	This procedure does not insert a call for raising the exception because
	that is currently done by the run time.

	* raise.h (__gnat_set_globals): Pass the detect_blocking parameter.

	* init.c: Add the global variable __gl_detect_blocking that indicates
	whether pragma Detect_Blocking is active (1) or not (0). Needed for
	making the pragma available at run time.
	(__gnat_set_globals): Pass and update the detect_blocking parameter.

	* lib-writ.adb (Write_ALI): Set the DB flag in the ali file if
	pragma Detect_Blocking is active.

	* lib-writ.ads: Document the Detect_Blocking flag (DB) in ali files.

	* ali.adb (Scan_ALI): Set the Detect_Blocking value to true if the flag

	Detect_Blocking is active and delay is called from a protected
	operation.

	* bindgen.adb (Gen_Adainit_Ada): When generating the call to

	Detect_Blocking is active (0 otherwise).
	(Gen_Adainit_C): When generating the call to __gnat_set_globals, pass 1

	(Register_Receiving_Stub): Add Subp_Info formal parameter.
	Update API in placeholder implemetation of s-parint to reflect changes
	in distribution runtime library.

	* sem_ch3.adb (Expand_Derived_Record): Rename to
	Expand_Record_Extension.

	* sem_disp.adb (Check_Controlling_Formals): Improve error message for
	primitive operations of potentially distributed object types that have
	non-controlling anonymous access formals.

	* sem_dist.ads, sem_dist.adb (Build_RAS_Primitive_Specification): New
	subprogram.
	New implementation of expansion for remote access-to-subprogram types,

	 __gnat_using_gnu_linker to 1.

	* Makefile.rtl, impunit.adb, g-perhas.ads, g-pehage.ads,
	g-pehage.adb: Rename GNAT.Perfect_Hash.Generators to
	GNAT.Perfect_Hash_Generators, and remove the empty
	GNAT.Perfect_Hash package.

	* atree.adb: Minor reformatting

	* exp_ch3.adb (Expand_Derived_Record): Rename to
	Expand_Record_Extension.
	(Build_Record_Init_Proc.Build_Assignment): The default expression in
	a component declaration must remain attached at that point in the
	tree so New_Copy_Tree copies it if the enclosing record type is derived.
	It is therefore necessary to take a copy of the expression when building
	the corresponding assignment statement in the init proc.
	As a side effect, in the case of a derived record type, we now see the
	original expression, without any rewriting that could have occurred
	during expansion of the ancestor type's init proc, and we do not need
	to go back to Original_Node.

	* exp_ch3.ads (Expand_Derived_Record): Rename to
	Expand_Record_Extension.

	* exp_dist.ads, exp_dist.adb (Underlying_RACW_Type): New subprogram.

	(Build_Get_Unique_RP_Call): New subprogram. Build a call to
	System.Partition_Interface.Get_Unique_Remote_Pointer.
	(Add_RAS_Access_TSS, Add_RAS_Dereference_TSS):
	Renamed from Add_RAS_*_Attribute.
	(Add_Receiving_Stubs_To_Declarations): Generate a table of local
	subprograms.
	New implementation of expansion for remote access-to-subprogram types,
	based on the RACW infrastructure.

	* exp_dist.ads (Copy_Specification): Update comment to note that this
	function can copy the specification from either a subprogram
	specification or an access-to-subprogram type definition.

	Minor reformatting.

2004-09-09  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@act-europe.fr>

2004-08-13  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* rtsfind.adb (Entity_Not_Defined): If the error ocurrs in a predefined
	unit, this is an attempt to inline a construct that is not available in

	discriminants that rename those of the parent, recover names of

	differences in signedness between sizetype and gnu_index_subtype.
	These are as legitimate as the ones caused by a lower TYPE_PRECISION
	on sizetype.

	(Normalize_Pathname): Only resolve VMS logical names when on VMS.

	* mlib-prj.adb (Build_Library): New flag Gtrasymobj_Needed, initialize

	g-trasym.ads, set Gtrasymobj_Needed to True.

	* prj-attr.adb: Add new package Metrics for gnatmetric

	* prj-nmsc.adb (Record_Other_Sources): Put source file names in
	canonical case to take into account files with upper case characters on

2004-06-07  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* bindgen.adb (Set_Unit_Number): Units is an instance of Table, and so
	the index of the last element is Units.Last, not Units.Table'Last
	(which is usually not a valid index within the actually allocated
	storage for the table).

	* exp_ch4.adb (Insert_Dereference_Action): Change predicate that
	determines whether to generate a call to a checked storage pool
	Dereference action.
	Generate such a call only for a dereference that either comes from
	source, or is the result of rewriting a dereference that comes from

	includes case of a variable referenced on the left hand side of an
	assignment, therefore remove redundant code. Variables and prefixes of
	indexed or selected components are now marked as referenced on left
	hand side. Warnings are now properly emitted when variables or prefixes
	are assigned but not read.

	* sem_warn.adb (Output_Unreferenced_Messages): Add additional checks to
	left hand side referenced variables. Private access types do not
	produce the warning "variable ... is assigned but never read".
	Add also additional checks to left hand side referenced variables.
	Aliased, renamed objects and access types do not produce the warning
	"variable ... is assigned but never read" since other entities may read
	the memory location.

2004-06-07  Jerome Guitton  <guitton@act-europe.fr>

	distinct from the operator appearing in the source, call appropriate
	routine to insert conversions when needed, and complete resolution of
	node.
	(Resolve_Intrinsic_Operator): Fix cut-and-paste bug on transfer of
	interpretations for rewritten right operand.
	(Set_Mixed_Mode_Operand): Handle properly a universal real operand when
	the other operand is overloaded and the context is a type conversion.

	generating code and the proper body of a stub is missing.

	* sem_ch4.adb (Remove_Address_Interpretations): If the operation still
	has a universal interpretation, do the disambiguation here.

	* exp_ch4.adb (Expand_N_Type_Conversion,
	Expand_N_Unchecked_Type_Conversion): Special handling when target type
	is Address, to avoid typing anomalies when Address is a visible integer
	type.

	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_N_Subprogram_Body): Use Is_Descendent_Of_Address

	a significant reference. Warnings are now properly emitted when a
	discriminated type is not referenced.

	* lib-xref.adb (Generate_Reference): A deferred constant completion,
	record representation clause or record type discriminant does not
	produce a reference to its corresponding entity. Warnings are now

	* a-numaux-x86.adb (Reduce): Reimplement using an approximation of Pi
	with 192 bits of precision, sufficient to reduce a double-extended
	arguments X with a maximum relative error of T'Machine_Epsilon, for X
	in -2.0**32 .. 2.0**32.
	(Cos, Sin):  Always reduce arguments of 1/4 Pi or larger, to prevent

	* par-ch10.adb (P_Context_Clause): Complete documentation on AI-262

	* sem_ch10.adb (Analyze_With_Clause): After analyzed, the entity
	corresponding to a private_with must be removed from visibility; it
	will be made visible later, just before we analyze the private part of
	the package.
	(Check_Private_Child_Unit): Allow private_with clauses in public
	siblings.
	(Install_Siblings): Make visible the private entities of private-withed
	siblings.
	(Install_Withed_Unit): Do not install the private withed unit if we
	are compiling a package declaration and the Private_With_OK flag was
	not set by the caller. These declarations will be installed later,
	just before we analyze the private part of the package.

	* sem_ch3.adb (Analyze_Object_Declaration): In case of errors detected
	during the evaluation of the expression that initializes the object,
	decorate it with the expected type to avoid cascade errors.
	Code cleanup.

	* sem_ch6.adb (Analyze_Subprogram_Body): If we are compiling a library
	subprogram we have to install the private_with clauses after its
	specification has been analyzed (as documented in AI-262.TXT).

	* sem_ch8.adb (Has_Private_With): New function. Determines if the
	current compilation unit has a private with on a given entity.
	(Find_Direct_Name): Detect the Beaujolais problem described in
	AI-262.TXT

	* sem_utils.ads, sem_util.adb (Is_Ancestor_Package): New function. It
	provides the functionality of the function Is_Ancestor that was

	overridden by a previous explicit declaration, mark the previous entity
	as overriding.

	* sem_disp.adb (Check_Dispatching_Operation): New predicate
	Is_Visibly_Controlled, to determine whether a declaration of a

	complete assignment subtree which is now unnecessary, as the expansion

	be generated.

	* sem_util.adb (Note_Possible_Modification): Reorganise the handling

	 - do not rely on Original_Node being present (Analyze_Assignment
	   calls Note_Possible_Modification on a copied tree).

	* sem_warn.adb (Check_References): When an unset reference to a pointer
	that is never assigned is encountered, prefer '<pointer> may be null'
	warning over '<pointer> is never assigned a value'.

	executable name when not initialized. Otherwise, use its current value.

	* osint.ads (Exec_Name): Move Exec_Name from body to spec in order to
	initialize it to another executable name than the current one. This
	allows to configure paths for an executable name (gnatmake) different

2004-03-29  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_Call): A call to a function declared in the

2004-03-25  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* sem_attr.adb (Check_Dereference): When the prefix of a 'Tag
	attribute reference does not denote a subtype, it can be any
	expression that has a classwide type, potentially after an implicit
	dereference.  In particular, the prefix can be a view conversion for
	a classwide type (for which Is_Object_Reference holds), but it can
	also be a value conversion for an access-to-classwide type. In the
	latter case, there is an implicit dereference, and the original node
	for the prefix does not verify Is_Object_Reference.

	* sem_util.adb (Is_Dependent_Component_Of_Mutable_Object): A view
	conversion of a discriminant-dependent component of a mutable object
	is one itself.

2004-03-25  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@gnat.com>

	* freeze.adb (Freeze_Entity): When an inherited subprogram is
	inherited, has convention C, and has unconstrained array parameters,
	place the corresponding warning on the derived type declaration rather
	than the original subprogram.

	* sem_ch12.adb (Instantiate_Formal_Subprogram): Set From_Default
	indication on renaming declaration, if formal has a box and actual

	the renamed entity.

	* sinfo.ads, sinfo.adb: New flag From_Default, to indicate that a
	subprogram renaming comes from a defaulted formal subprogram in an
	instance.

2004-03-25  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@gnat.com>

	* sem_elab.adb (Check_Elab_Call): Refine loop that checks for default
	value expressions to ensure that calls within a component definition

	gigi has enough information to construct the record, and there is no
	place in the tree for the declaration.

	* sem_ch6.adb (Build_Body_To_Inline): Use an internal name without
	serial number for the dummy body that is built for analysis, to avoid
	inconsistencies in the generation of internal names when compiling

	* ada-tree.h: Update copyright notice.
	Minor reformatting.

2004-03-19  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>

	* decl.c (gnat_to_gnu_entity, case E_Exception): Handle VMS exceptions
	as regular exception objects and not as mere integers representing the
	condition code.  The latter approach required some dynamics to mask off
	severity bits, which did not fit well into the GCC table based model.
	(gnat_to_gnu_entity, objects): Don't supply an external name for VMS
	exception data objects. We don't it and it would conflict with the other
	external symbol we have to generate for such exceptions.

	* trans.c (tree_transform, case N_Exception_Handler): Remove part of
	the special code for VMS exceptions, since these are now represented
	as regular exceptions objects.

2004-03-19 Richard Kenner  <kenner@vlsi1.ultra.nyu.edu>

2004-03-18  Thomas Quinot  <quinot@act-europe.fr>

	* adaint.c: Update comments.

	* Makefile.in: set PREFIX_OBJS, SYMLIB, THREADSLIB, and
	GNATLIB_SHARED for FreeBSD.

2004-03-18  Jose Ruiz  <ruiz@act-europe.fr>

	When needed (stack checking) the stack size is retrieved
	from the VxWorks kernel.

	* Makefile.in: Flag -nostdinc is required when building the run time
	for avoiding looking for files in the base compiler.
	Add the VxWorks specific version of the package body for
	System.Stack_checking.Operations (5zstchop.adb).

	* Make-lang.in: Add the object file for
	System.Stack_Checking.Operations.

	* Makefile.rtl: Add object file for the package
	System.Stack_Checking.Operations.

	* s-stchop.ads, s-stchop.adb, 5zstchop.adb: New files.

	* s-stache.ads, s-stache.adb: Move the operations related to stack
	checking from this package to package System.Stack_Checking.Operations.
	This way, stack checking operations are only linked in the final
	executable when using the -fstack-check flag.

2004-03-18  Doug Rupp  <rupp@gnat.com>

	removed and the directory is always put as the last in the table.
	Write the path files at the end of these accumulations.

	* a-ngcoty.adb (Modulus): In alternate formula for large real or
	imaginary parts, use Double precision throughout.

	* a-tifiio.adb (Put_Scaled): Remove remaining pragma Debug. Not only
	we want to be able to compile run-time with -gnata for testing, but
	this may also be instantiated in user code that is compiled with -gnata.

2004-03-15  Olivier Hainque  <hainque@act-europe.fr>

	* s-stalib.ads (Exception_Code): New type, to represent Import/Export
	codes. Having a separate type for this is useful to enforce consistency
	throughout the various run-time units.

	occurrence matches some handler choice specification. Extracted out of
	get_action_description_for, and expanded to take care of the VMS
	specifities.
	(get_action_description_for): Use is_handled_by instead of an explicit
	complex condition to decide if the current choice at hand catches the
	propagated occurrence.

	* raise.h (Exception_Code): New type for C.

	* rtsfind.ads (RE_Id, RE_Unit_Table): Add
	System.Standard_Library.Exception_Code, to allow references from the

	New accessors to allow easy access to GNAT exception data
	characteristics.
	(GNAT_GCC_Exception record, Propagate_Exception): Get rid of the
	redundant Handled_By_Others component, helper for the personality
	routine which will now be able to call the appropriate exception data
	accessor instead.

	* cstand.adb (Create_Standard): Adjust the type of the Import_Code
	component of Standard_Exception_Type to be the closest possible to
	Exception_Code in System.Standard_Library, that we cannot get at this
	point. Expand a ??? comment to notify that this type node should
	probably be rewritten later on.

	* exp_prag.adb (Expand_Pragma_Import_Export_Exception): Adjust the
	registration call to include a pointer to the exception object in the
	arguments.

	* init.c (__gnat_error_handler): Use Exception_Code and Base_Code_In

	* g-os_lib.ads, g-os_lib.adb (Create_Output_Text_File): New function.

	* make.adb (Gnatmake): Do not check the executable suffix; it is being
	taken care of in Scan_Make_Arg.
	(Scan_Make_Arg): Add the executable suffix only if the argument
	following -o, in canonical case, does not end with the executable
	suffix.  When in verbose mode and executable file name does not end
	with executable suffix, output the executable name, in canonical case.

	* s-tataat.ads (Access_Dummy_Wrapper): Add pragma No_Strict_Aliasing
	to avoid warnings when instantiating Ada.Task_Attributes.
	Minor reformating.

	* mlib-prj.adb (Process_Imported_Libraries): Get the imported libraries

	be modified by the binder generated main program if the -D switch is
	used.

	* 4onumaux.ads, 4znumaux.ads: Add Pure_Function pragmas for all

	processing if the type involved has non-bit-aligned components

	* exp_ch5.adb (Expand_Assign_Array): Avoid assumption that
	N_String_Literal node always references an E_String_Literal_Subtype
	entity. This may not be true in the future.
	(Possible_Bit_Aligned_Component): Move processing of
	Component_May_Be_Bit_Aligned from exp_ch5 to exp_util

	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_Thread_Body): Pick up

	Note if secondary stack unit is used by compiler.

	* sem_elab.adb (Check_A_Call): Rewrite to avoid trying to put
	ineffective elaborate all pragmas on non-visible packages (this

	based on the new naming scheme.

	* gnatlink.adb (Process_Binder_File): Properly detect the new naming

	scheme.
	(install-gnatlib): Do not create symlinks for shared libraries.

	configurable run-time (e.g. if a library is not needed at all, provide
	a dummy empty library).

	* targparm.ads: Configurable_Run_Time mode no longer affects linker
	options (-L parameters and standard libraries). What we plan to do is

2003-12-08  Javier Miranda  <miranda@gnat.com>

	* exp_aggr.adb (Build_Record_Aggr_Code): Do not remove the expanded
	aggregate in the parent. Otherwise constants with limited aggregates
	are not supported. Add new formal to pass the component type (Ctype).
	It is required to call the corresponding IP subprogram in case of
	default initialized components.
	(Gen_Assign): In case of default-initialized component, generate a
	call to the IP subprogram associated with the component.
	(Build_Record_Aggr_Code): Remove the aggregate from the parent in case
	of aggregate with default initialized components.
	(Has_Default_Init_Comps): Improve implementation to recursively check
	all the present expressions.

	* exp_ch3.ads, exp_ch3.adb (Build_Initialization_Call): Add new formal
	to indicate that the initialization call corresponds to a
	default-initialized component of an aggregate.
	In case of default initialized aggregate with tasks this parameter is
	used to generate a null string (this is just a workaround that must be
	improved later). In case of discriminants, this parameter is used to
	generate a selected component node that gives access to the discriminant
	value.

	* exp_ch9.ads, exp_ch9.adb (Build_Task_Allocate_Block_With_Stmts): New
	subprogram, based on Build_Task_Allocate_Block, but adapted to expand
	allocated aggregates with default-initialized components.

	* par-ch4.adb (P_Aggregate_Or_Paren_Expr): Improve error message if
	the box notation is used in positional aggregates.

	(Post_Parse_Context_Clause): Use the N_With_Clause nodes stored in the
	With_Records.
	(Parse_Single_Project): Call Pre_Parse_Context_Clause before creating
	the N_Project node. Call Tree.Save and Tree.Reset before scanning the
	current project. Call Tree.Restore afterwards. Set the various nodes

	Previous_End).

	* prj-part.ads (Parse): New Boolean parameter Store_Comments,
	defaulted to False.

	(Time_Stamp_Mismatch): use CRC_Match for comparison.
	(Set_Source_Table): idem.

	* ali-util.ads:
	(Get_File_Checksum): renamed Get_File_CRC as now we compute CRC
	instead of simple checksum.
	(CRC_Match): new function.
	(CRC_Error): new constant.

	* ali.adb (Scan_ALI): rename variable Chk to CRC as we are handling
	a CRC now and not a simple checksum. A CRC uses lower-case hex
	letters, fixes ambiguity in parsing.

	* ali.ads (Sdep_Record.Checksum): renamed Sdep_Record.CRC as this
	is what this variable will store.

	* bcheck.adb: Change reference to chechsum in comments by CRC.
	(Check_Consistency): Rename Get_File_Checksum to Get_File_CRC.
	rename All_Checksum_Match to All_CRC_Match. Change due to API
	renaming since now GNAT does not use a simple checksum but a
	CRC using GNAT.CRC32.

	* gnatls.adb: Rename Checksum to CRC in many places, we use a CRC
	now and not anymore a simple checksum.

	* lib-load.adb: Use Source_CRC instead of Source_Checksum in many

	Update comments for the CRC.

	* types.adb (Hex): Use lowercase for the letter part.

	* types.ads (Get_Hex_String): Returns the hexadecimal representation
	for a word. This is currently used only for CRC. In previous version,
	the checksum was using a representation with all letter being
	upper-case. With the new implementation (using CRC) we do not remove
	the 32th bit of the CRC, so we can have an upper-case starting letter
	in the CRC. This is not possible to parse in Scan_ALI (ali.adb).
	It is ambigous since the CRC was optional and could be followed by
	options like EB, EE. So now this routines uses lower-case letter for
	the hexadecimal representation. Strange enough only lower case letters
	where checked in Scan_ALI (even if this was not a possible case).

	* gnatvsn.ads (Library_Version): changed to 3.15a.

	* s-crc32.ads: Initial version from GNAT.CRC32. This is the version
	for the compiler.

	for the compiler.

	* ali-util.adb: Redo previous change to avoid using word CRC everywhere
	Add 2001 to copyright notice
	(Accumulate_Checksum): Modify to use System.CRC32.

	* ali-util.ads: Redo changes of previous revision to continue to use
	the word Checksum. Add 2001 to copyright notice.

	* ali.adb: Undo some of previous changes, not needed.
	Keep the change for lower case letters in the checksum.

	* ali.ads: Undo previous change not needed.

	* bcheck.adb: Undo most of previous change, not needed.
	But do use Checksums_Match for checksum comparison.

	* lib-load.adb: Undo previous change, not needed.

	* lib-writ.adb: Undo previous change, not needed.

	* lib-writ.ads: Document that checksums use lower case,
	not upper case letters.
