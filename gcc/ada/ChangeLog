	(Set_Restriction_No_Use_Of_Entity): Update the parameter profile.
	* sem_attr.adb (Analyze_Attribute): Check restriction
	No_Use_Of_Attribute.
	* sem_ch13.adb (Analyze_Attribute_Definition_Clause): Check
	restriction No_Use_Of_Attribute before any rewritings have
	taken place.
	* sem_prag.adb (Analyze_Pragma): Check restriction
	No_Use_Of_Pragma before any rewritings have taken place.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch6.adb (Is_Inline_Pragma): The pragma
	argument can be a selected component, which has no Chars field,
	so we need to deal with that case (use the Selector_Name).
	(Check_Inline_Pragma): We need to test Is_List_Member before
	calling In_Same_List, because in case of a library unit, they're
	not in lists, so In_Same_List fails an assertion.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* namet.ads, namet.adb: Add an Append that appends a
	Bounded_String onto a Bounded_String. Probably a little more
	efficient than "Append(X, +Y);". Also minor cleanup.
	(Append_Decoded, Append_Decoded_With_Brackets, Append_Unqualified,
	Append_Unqualified_Decoded): Make sure these work with non-empty
	buffers.
	* casing.ads, casing.adb (Set_Casing): Pass a Bounded_String
	parameter, defaulting to Global_Name_Buffer.
	* errout.ads, errout.adb (Adjust_Name_Case): Pass a
	Bounded_String parameter, no default.
	* exp_ch11.adb (Expand_N_Raise_Statement): Use local
	Bounded_String instead of Global_Name_Buffer.
	* exp_intr.ads, exp_intr.adb (Write_Entity_Name): Rename it
	to Append_Entity_Name, and pass a Bounded_String parameter,
	instead of using globals.
	(Add_Source_Info): Pass a Bounded_String parameter, instead of
	using globals.
	(Expand_Source_Info): Use local instead of globals.
	* stringt.ads, stringt.adb (Append): Add an Append procedure
	for appending a String_Id onto a Bounded_String.
	(String_To_Name_Buffer, Add_String_To_Name_Buffer): Rewrite in
	terms of Append.
	* sem_prag.adb (Set_Error_Msg_To_Profile_Name): Adjust for new
	Adjust_Name_Case parameter.
	* erroutc.adb, uname.adb: Don't pass D => Mixed_Case to
	Set_Casing; that's the default.
	* lib-xref-spark_specific.adb (Add_SPARK_Scope): Pretend that calls to
	protected subprograms are entry calls; otherwise it is not possible to
	distinguish them from regular subprogram calls.

2016-04-18  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch13.adb (Has_Good_Profile): Improvement
	of error message. Now indicates subtype_mark of formal parameter
	rather than the formal's name, plus minor rewording.

2016-04-18  Pascal Obry  <obry@adacore.com>

	* adaint.c, adaint.h, s-os_lib.ads: Add new routine Current_Process_Id.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* stringt.adb, exp_ch6.adb, sem_ch13.adb: Minor reformatting.

2016-04-18  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* par-ch4.adb, sem_prag.adb: Minor reformatting.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* sinput.ads, sinput.adb (Build_Location_String): Take a
	parameter instead of using a global variable.  The function
	version no longer destroys the Name_Buffer.
	* stringt.ads, stringt.adb (String_From_Name_Buffer): Take a
	parameter, which defaults to the Global_Name_Buffer, so some
	calls can avoid the global.
	* exp_ch11.adb, exp_intr.adb: Use new interfaces above
	to avoid using globals. All but one call to Build_Location_String
	avoids the global. Only one call to String_From_Name_Buffer
	avoids it.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* namet.adb, namet.ads, exp_unst.adb: Minor reformatting.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* sem_eval.adb (Choice_Matches): Check the expression
	against the predicate values when the choice denotes a
	subtype with a static predicate.
	(Eval_Membership_Op): Code cleanup. Remove the suspicious guard which
	tests for predicates.
	(Is_OK_Static_Subtype): A subtype with a dynamic predicate
	is not static.	(Is_Static_Subtype): A subtype with a dynamic
	predicate is not static.
	* sem_eval.ads (Is_OK_Static_Subtype): Update the comment on usage.
	(Is_Static_Subtype): Update the comment on usage.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Analyze_Input_Item): Allow
	generic formals to appear as initialization items.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch13.adb (Analyze_Stream_TSS_Definition,
	Has_Good_Profile): Additional error message to indicate that
	the second parameter of the subprogram must be a first subtype.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch6.adb (Analyze_Subprogram_Body_Helper, Is_Inline_Pragma):
	Use the pragma lookahead that determines whether a subprogram
	is to be inlined, when some level of backend optimization is
	required.
	* sem_ch12.ads, sem_ch12.adb (Add_Pending_Instantiation): Factorize
	code used to create an instance body when needed for inlining.
	* exp_ch6.adb (Expand_Call): When a call is to be inlined, and the
	call appears within an instantiation that is not a compilation
	unit, add a pending instantiation for the enclosing instance,
	so the backend can inline in turn the calls contained in the
	inlined body.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Build_Pragma_Check_Equivalent): The mapping
	that relates operations of the parent type to the operations of
	the derived type has three distinct sources:
	a) explicit operations of the derived type carry an
	Overridden_Operation that designates the operation in the
	ancestor.
	b) Implicit operations that are inherited by the derived type
	carry an alias that may be an explicit subprogram (in which case
	it may have an Overridden_ Operation indicator) or may also be
	inherited and carry its own alias.
	c) If the parent type is an interface, the operation of the
	derived type does not override, but the interface operation
	indicates the operation that implements it.
	* sem_prag.adb: Minor reformatting.
	* sem_prag.adb (Check_External_Property): Update
	the comment on usage. Reimplement.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch5.adb (Expand_Assignment_Statement): In restricted
	profiles such as ZFP, ceiling priority is not available.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* namet-sp.ads: Minor typo fix, ironically in 'Spelling_Checker'.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* sem_elab.adb (Output_Calls): Use
	Get_Name_String, to clearly indicate that the global Name_Buffer
	is being used. The previous code used Is_Internal_Name, which
	returns a Boolean, but also has a side effect of setting the
	Name_Buffer. Then it called the other Is_Internal_Name, which uses
	the Name_Buffer for its input. And then it called Error_Msg_N,
	again using the Name_Buffer. We haven't eliminated the global
	usage here, but we've made it a bit clearer.
	This also allows us to have a side-effect-free version of
	Is_Internal_Name.
	* namet.ads, namet.adb: Provide a type Bounded_String, along with
	routines that can be used without using global variables. Provide
	Global_Name_Buffer so existing code can continue to use the
	global. Mark the routines that use globals as obsolete.  New code
	shouldn't call the obsolete ones, and we should clean up existing
	code from time to time.
	Name_Find_Str is renamed as Name_Find.
	* namet.h: Changed as necessary to interface to the new version
	of Namet.
	* bindgen.adb, exp_unst.adb: Name_Find_Str is renamed as
	Name_Find.

2016-04-18  Yannick Moy  <moy@adacore.com>

	* sem_util.adb, sem_util.ads (Has_Full_Default_Initialization): used
	outside of GNATprove, hence it should not be removed.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Analyze_Refinement_Clause):
	The refinement of an external abstract state can now mention
	non-external constituents.
	(Check_External_Property): Update all SPARK RM references.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* exp_intr.adb: Remove some duplicated code.

2016-04-18  Johannes Kanig  <kanig@adacore.com>

	* gnat1drv.adb (Gnat1drv): Force loading of System
	unit for SPARK.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* a-cuprqu.adb: Correction to previous change. If a new node
	is inserted at the front of the queue (because it is higher
	priority than the previous front node), we need to update
	Header.Next_Unequal -- not just in the case where the queue was
	previously empty.

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* a-cuprqu.ads: Change the representation of List_Type from a
	singly-linked list to a doubly-linked list. In addition, add a
	pointer Next_Unequal, which points past a possibly-long chain
	of equal-priority items. This increases efficiency, especially
	in the case of many equal-priority items.
	* a-cuprqu.adb (Dequeue, Enqueue): Rewrite algorithms to take
	advantage of new data structure.
	(Finalize): Rewrite in terms of Dequeue, for simplicity.

2016-04-18  Yannick Moy  <moy@adacore.com>

	* contracts.adb (Analyze_Object_Contract,
	Analyze_Protected_Contract): Remove tests performed in GNATprove.

	* sem_aggr.adb (Resolve_Record_Aggregate): If
	Warn_On_Redundant_Constructs is enabled, report a redundant box
	association that does not cover any components, as it done for
	redundant others associations in case statements.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.adb (Collect_Inherited_Class_Wide_Conditions):
	Analyze the generated Check pragma for an inherited condition so
	that it does not freeze the dispatching type of the primitive
	operation, because it is pre-analyzed at the point of the
	subprogram declaration (and not in the subprogram body, as is
	done during regular expansion).

2016-04-18  Vincent Celier  <celier@adacore.com>

	* ali.ads: Increase the range of all _Id types to 100 millions.

2016-04-18  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* sem_warn.adb (Check_References): Change warning to suggest
	using pragma Export rather than saying "volatile has no effect".

2016-04-18  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* g-souinf.ads (Compilation_ISO_Date): New function to return
	the current date in ISO form.
	* exp_intr.adb (Expand_Source_Info, Add_Source_Info): Expand
	a call to Compilation_ISO_Date into a string literal containing
	the current date in ISO form.
	* exp_intr.ads (Add_Source_Info): Improve documentation.
	* sem_intr.adb (Check_Intrinsic_Subprogram): Recognize
	Compilation_ISO_Date.
	* snames.ads-tmpl (Name_Compilation_ISO_Date): New Name_Id.

2016-04-18  Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@adacore.com>

	* layout.adb (Set_Elem_Alignment): Extend setting of alignment
	to subtypes that are not first subtypes.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_prag.ads (Collect_Inherited_Class_Wide_Conditions):
	Simplify interface.
	* sem_prag.adb (Collect_Inherited_Class_Wide_Conditions): Insert
	generated pragmas after subprogram declaration, rather than in
	the corresponding subprogram body.
	* sem_ch6.adb (New_Overloaded_Entity): In GNATProve
	mode, if the operation is overridding, call
	Collect_Inherited_Class_Wide_Conditions to generate the
	corresponding pragmas immediately after the corresponding
	subprogram declaration.

2016-04-18  Arnaud Charlet  <charlet@adacore.com>

	* spark_xrefs.ads (Xref_Index, Scope_Index, File_Index): restrict
	type to natural numbers.

2016-04-18  Ed Schonberg  <schonberg@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch4.adb (Analyze_Selected_Component): Refine error
	detection when a selected component in the body of a synchronized
	type is a reference to an object of the same type declared
	elsewhere. The construct is legal if the prefix of the selected
	component includes an explicit dereference at any point.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch3.adb (Analyze_Object_Declaration): Do not consider
	internally generated expressions when trying to determine whether
	a formal parameter of a tagged type subject to Extensions_Visible
	False is used to initialize an object.
	* sem_ch4.adb (Analyze_Type_Conversion): Do not consider
	internally generated expressions when trying to determine whether
	a formal parameter of a tagged type subject to Extensions_Visible
	False is used in a type conversion.

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* sem_res.adb (Is_Protected_Operation_Call):
	Add guards to account for a non-decorated selected component.

	procedure for overriding subprograms, used to generate the pragmas
	corresponding to an inherited class- wide pre- or postcondition.
	* sem_prag.adb (Build_Pragma_Check_Equivalent): moved here
	from contracts.adb (Replace_Condition_Entities): Subsidiary
	Build_Pragma_Check_Equivalent, to implement the proper semantics
	of inherited class-wide conditions, as given in AI12-0113.
	(Process_Class_Wide_Condition): Removed.

	indeterminate.
	(Check_Dispatching_Context): Add parameter to support recursive

2016-04-18  Hristian Kirtchev  <kirtchev@adacore.com>

	* freeze.adb (Freeze_Entity): Use New_Freeze_Node
	to create a brand new freeze node. This handles a case where an
	ignored Ghost context is freezing something which is not ignored
	Ghost and whose freeze node should not be removed from the tree.
	(New_Freeze_Node): New routine.

2016-04-18  Jerome Lambourg  <lambourg@adacore.com>

	* sigtramp.h (__gnat_set_is_vxsim) New function to
	tell sigtramp-vxworks to handle vxsim signal contexts.	*
	sigtramp-vxworks.c (__gnat_sigtramp) Take into account the
	differences in the sigcontext structure between the expected
	regular x86 or x86_64 ones and the ones received in case of
	exexution on the vxworks simulator.
	* init.c: also compute is_vxsim in case of x86_64-vx7 target. Provide
	this information to sigtramp-vxworks.c. Remove the old mechanism for
	vxsim.
	* init-vxsim.c, sigtramp-vxworks-vxsim.c: remove, now obsolete.

2016-04-18  Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@adacore.com>

2016-04-18  Jerome Lambourg  <lambourg@adacore.com>

	* sigtramp-vxworks-target.inc: sigtramp-vxworks: force the stack
	alignment for x86_64.
	* init.c: Better fix for guard page reset on x86_64-vx7.
	Do not try to retrieve the page that actually raised
	the signal as the probing mechanism used on x86_64 do not allow
	such retrieval. We thus just test if the guard page is active,
	and re-activate it if not.

2016-04-18  Arnaud Charlet  <charlet@adacore.com>
