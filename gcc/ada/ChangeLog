	parameter is True, then a slice of an aliased non-bitpacked array
	is aliased, a constrained nominal subtype does not force a result
	of False, and a dereference of an extended access value is
	aliased. The last point is somewhat subtle. This is how we prevent
	covert fat-to-nonfat type conversions via things like
	"Not_Extended_Type'(Extended_Ptr.all'Access)" or passing
	Extended_Ptr.all as an actual parameter corresponding to an
	explicitly aliased formal parameter.

2024-09-02  Bob Duff  <duff@adacore.com>

	* doc/gnat_rm/gnat_language_extensions.rst: I assume "extended set
	of extensions" was a typo for "experimental set of extensions",
	because "extended extensions" is repetitive and redundant. "in
	addition" clarifies that the one subsumes the other. Add a
	reminder at the start of each subsection about what switch/pragma
	enables what extensions. Add new section about "Inference of
	Dependent Types in Generic Instantiations".

	* sem_ch6.adb (Check_Discriminant_Conformance): Immediately after
	calling Is_Immutably_Limited_Type, perform an additional test that
	one might reasonably imagine would instead have been part of
	Is_Immutably_Limited_Type. The new test is a call to a new
	function Has_Tagged_Limited_Partial_View whose implementation
	includes a call to Incomplete_Or_Partial_View, which cannot be
	easily be called from Is_Immutably_Limited_Type (because sem_aux,
	which is in the closure of the binder, cannot easily "with"
	sem_util).

	For this implementation type, if its component type is the same as
	that of the original type, copy the alias set from the latter.

	(Others_Choice): Remove this variable; no longer needed.
	* types.ads (Text_Ptr): Add a range constraint limiting the

	caught.
	* sinput.ads (Sloc_Adjust): Use the base subtype; this is used as

2024-05-20  Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@adacore.com>

	* exp_aggr.ads (Is_Delayed_Conditional_Expression): New predicate.
	* exp_aggr.adb (Convert_To_Assignments.Known_Size): Likewise.
	(Convert_To_Assignments): Climb the parent chain, looking through
	qualified expressions and dependent expressions of conditional
	expressions, to find out whether the expansion may be delayed.
	Call Known_Size for this in the case of an object declaration.
	If so, set Expansion_Delayed on the aggregate as well as all the
	intermediate conditional expressions.
	(Initialize_Component): Reset the Analyzed flag on an initialization
	expression that is a conditional expression whose expansion has been
	delayed.
	(Is_Delayed_Conditional_Expression): New predicate.
	* exp_ch3.adb (Expand_N_Object_Declaration): Handle initialization
	expressions that are conditional expressions whose expansion has
	been delayed.
	* exp_ch4.adb (Build_Explicit_Assignment): New procedure.
	(Expand_Allocator_Expression): Handle initialization expressions
	that are conditional expressions whose expansion has been delayed.
	(Expand_N_Case_Expression): Deal with expressions whose expansion
	has been delayed by waiting for the rewriting of their parent as
	an assignment statement and then optimizing the assignment.
	(Expand_N_If_Expression): Likewise.
	(Expand_N_Qualified_Expression): Do not apply a predicate check to
	an operand that is a delayed aggregate or conditional expression.
	* gen_il-gen-gen_nodes.adb (N_If_Expression): Add Expansion_Delayed
	semantic flag.
	(N_Case_Expression): Likewise.
	* sinfo.ads (Expansion_Delayed): Document extended usage.

2024-05-20  Gary Dismukes  <dismukes@adacore.com>

	* exp_aggr.adb (Expand_Container_Aggregate): Add top-level
	variables Choice_{Lo|Hi} and Int_Choice_{Lo|Hi} used for
	determining the low and high bounds of component association
	choices. Replace code for determining whether we have an indexed
	aggregate with call to new function Sem_Aggr.Is_Indexed_Aggregate.
	Remove test of whether Empty_Subp is a function, since it must be
	a function. Move Default and Count_Type to be locals of a new
	block enclosing the code that creates the object to hold the
	aggregate length, and set them according to the default and type
	of the Empty function's parameter when present (and to Empty and
	Standard_Natural otherwise). Use Siz_Exp for the aggregate length
	when set, and use Empty's default length when available, and use
	zero for the length otherwise. In generating the call to the
	New_Indexed function, use the determined lower and upper bounds if
	determined earlier by Aggregate_Size, and otherwise compute those
	from the index type's lower bound and the determined aggregate
	length. In the case where a call to Empty is generated and the
	function has a formal parameter, pass the value saved in Siz_Decl
	(otherwise the parameter list is empty). Remove code specific to
	making a parameterless call to the Empty function. Extend the code
	for handling positional container aggregates to account for types
	that define Assign_Indexed, rather than just Add_Unnamed, and in
	the case of indexed aggregates, create a temporary object to hold
	values of the aggregate's key index, and initialize and increment
	that temporary for each call generated to the Assign_Indexed
	procedure. For named container aggregates that have key choices
	given by ranges, call Expand_Range_Component to generate a loop
	that will call the appropriate insertion procedure for each value
	of the range. For indexed aggregates with a Component_Associations
	list, set and use the Assign_Indexed procedure for each component
	association, whether or not there's an iterator specification.
	(Add_Range_Size): Add code to determine the low and high bounds of
	the range and capture those in up-level variables when their value
	is less than or greater than (respectively) the current minimum
	and maximum bounds values.
	(Aggregate_Size): Separately handle the case where a single choice
	is of a discrete type, and call Add_Range_Size to take its value
	into consideration for determination of min and max bounds of the
	aggregate. Add comments in a couple of places.
	(Build_Siz_Exp): Remove the last sentence and "???" from the
	comment that talks about accumulating nonstatic sizes, since that
	sentence seems to be obsolete. Record the low and high bound
	values in Choice_Lo and Choice_Hi in the case of a nonstatic
	range.
	(Expand_Iterated_Component): Set the Defining_Identifier of the
	iterator specification to the Loop_Id in the
	N_Iterated_Component_Association case.
	(Expand_Range_Component): Procedure unnested from the block
	handling indexed aggregates in Expand_Container_Aggregate, and
	moved to top level of that procedure so it can also be called for
	Add_Named cases. A formal parameter Insert_Op is added, and
	existing calls to this procedure are changed to pass the
	appropriate insertion procedure's Entity.
	* sem_aggr.ads: Add with_clause for Sinfo.Nodes.
	(Is_Indexed_Aggregate): New function for use by
	Resolve_Container_Aggregate and Expand_Container_Aggregate.
	* sem_aggr.adb: Add with_clause for Sem_Ch5. Move with_clause for
	Sinfo.Nodes to sem_aggr.ads.
	(Is_Indexed_Aggregate): New function to determine whether a
	container aggregate is a container aggregate (replacing local
	variable of the same name in Resolve_Container_Aggregate).
	(Resolve_Iterated_Association): Remove part of comment saying that
	a Key_Expression is always present. Set Parent field of the copy
	of a component association with a loop parameter specification. On
	the setting of Loop_Param_Id, account for a
	Loop_Parameter_Specification being changed into an
	Iterator_Specification as a result of being analyzed. Only call
	Preanalyze_And_Resolve on Key_Expr when a key expression is
	actually present. Remove loop for handling choices for the case of
	an N_Component_Association with a Defining_Identifier (there
	shouldn't be more than one choice in this case, and add an
	assertion to ensure that). Also add code here to handle the case
	where the choice is a function call, creating an
	iterator_specification analyzing it, and call
	Resolve_Iterated_Association recursively to process it. Add error
	check to enforce RM22 4.3.5(27), which requires that the type of
	the loop parameter must be the same as the key type when there is
	no key expression and the aggregate is an indexed aggregate or has
	an Add_Named op.
	(Resolve_Container_Aggregate): In the Add_Unnamed case, call
	Resolve_Iterated_Association for both
	N_Iterated_Element_Association and N_Component_Association (rather
	than just the latter). Remove error check for nonstatic choices in
	component associations in Add_Named cases (multiple named
	nonstatic associations are fine except in indexed aggregates).
	Remove local variable Is_Indexed_Aggregate, replaced with new
	library-level function of the same name, and add test of
	Is_Indexed_Aggregate in the case where the aggregate type has an
	Assign_Indexed operation, as a guard for doing error checks for
	indexed aggregates. For indexed aggregate resolution, do not call
	Analyze_And_Resolve on the expression of an
	N_Component_Association in the "box association" case. Move error
	checks for indexed aggregates with iterated associations that flag
	cases where an association is a loop_parameter_specification with
	an iterator filter or a key expression (violation of RM22
	4.3.5(28/5)), from the loop that checks for contiguous and
	nonoverlapping choices and into the preceding association loop
	after the call to Resolve_Iterated_Association. The RM reference
	is added to the error-message strings.

2024-05-14  Steve Baird  <baird@adacore.com>

	* exp_attr.adb (Build_And_Insert_Type_Attr_Subp): If a subprogram

	* exp_util.adb (Find_Hook_Context): Exclude N_*Aggregate Nkinds

	function rather than the enclosing declaration or statement.

2024-05-14  Steve Baird  <baird@adacore.com>

	* exp_attr.adb: Replace 6 "not Present" tests with equivalent calls to "No".

2024-05-14  Eric Botcazou  <ebotcazou@adacore.com>

	* exp_ch3.adb (Expand_N_Object_Declaration): Examine the Expression
	field after the call to Default_Initialize_Object in order to set
	Is_Known_Null, as well as Is_Known_Non_Null, on an access object.

2024-05-14  Steve Baird  <baird@adacore.com>

	* exp_attr.adb: Change name of package Cached_Streaming_Ops to
	reflect the fact that it is now also used for Put_Image
	procedures. Similarly change other "Streaming_Op" names therein.
	Add Validate_Cached_Candidate procedure to detect case where a
	subprogram found in the cache cannot be reused. Add new generic
	procedure Build_And_Insert_Type_Attr_Subp; the "Build" part is
	handled by just calling a formal procedure; the bulk of this
	(generic) procedure's code has to with deciding where in the tree
	to insert the newly-constructed subprogram. Replace each later
	"Build" call (and the following Insert_Action or
	Compile_Stream_Body_In_Scope call) with a declare block that
	instantiates and then calls this generic procedure. Delete the
	now-unused procedure Compile_Stream_Body_In_Scope. A constructed
	subprogram is entered in the appropriate cache if the
	corresponding type is untagged; this replaces more complex tests.
	A new function Interunit_Ref_OK is added to determine whether an
	attribute reference occuring in one unit can safely refer to a
	cached subprogram declared in another unit.
	* exp_ch3.adb (Build_Predefined_Primitive_Bodies): A formal
	parameter was deleted, so delete the corresponding actual in a
	call.
	* exp_put_image.adb (Build_Array_Put_Image_Procedure): Because the
	procedure being built may be referenced more than once, the
	generated procedure takes its source position info from the type
	declaration instead of the (first) attribute reference.
	(Build_Record_Put_Image_Procedure): Likewise.
	* exp_put_image.ads (Build_Array_Put_Image_Procedure): Eliminate
	now-unused Nod parameter.
	(Build_Record_Put_Image_Procedure): Eliminate now-unused Loc parameter.
	* sem_ch3.adb (Constrain_Discriminated_Type): For declaring a
	subtype with a discriminant constraint, ignore privacy if
	Comes_From_Source is false (as is already done if Is_Instance is
	true).
	* sem_res.adb (Resolve): When passed two type entities that have
	the same underlying base type, Sem_Type.Covers may return False in
	some cases because of privacy. [This can happen even if
	Is_Private_Type returns False both for Etype (N) and for Typ;
	Covers calls Base_Type, which can take a non-private argument and
	yield a private result.] If Comes_From_Source (N) is False
	(e.g., for a compiler-generated Put_Image or streaming subprogram), then
	avoid that scenario by not calling Covers. Covers already has tests for
	doing this sort of thing (see the calls therein to Full_View_Covers),
	but the Comes_From_Source test is too coarse to apply there. So instead
	we handle the problem here at the call site.
	(Original_Implementation_Base_Type): A new function. Same as
	Implementation_Base_Type except if the Original_Node attribute of
	a non-derived type declaration indicates that it once was a derived
	type declaration. Needed for looking through privacy.
	(Valid Conversion): Ignore privacy when converting between different views
	of the same type if Comes_From_Source is False for the conversion.
	(Valid_Tagged_Conversion): An ancestor-to-descendant conversion is not an
	illegal downward conversion if there is no type extension involved
	(because the derivation was from an untagged view of the parent type).

2024-05-14  Steve Baird  <baird@adacore.com>

	* sem_ch5.adb (Analyze_Case_Statement): Emit a message and return
	early in the case where general case statements are allowed but
	the selector expression is of a private type. This is done to
	avoid a bugbox.

2024-05-14  Justin Squirek  <squirek@adacore.com>

	* sem_util.adb (Set_Referenced_Modified): Use Original_Node to

	* rtsfind.adb (Load_RTU): Wrap an Instance_Context Save/Restore

	a Subp is if we are nested inside a subprogram that also has a
	postcondition, and in that case we would find the wrong (outer)
	one. In any case, Subp is set to Empty after the loop, so all
	subsequent tests for Present (Subp) are necessarily False; remove
	them and the corresponding code. Set Ins_Node unconditionally (to
	the right thing). Remove obsolete comments.
