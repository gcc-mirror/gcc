   ------------------------------------
   -- Handling of Static Expressions --
   ------------------------------------

   --  This package contains a set of routines that process individual
   --  subexpression nodes with the objective of folding (precomputing) the
   --  value of static expressions that are known at compile time and properly
   --  computing the setting of two flags that appear in every subexpression
   --  node:

   --    Is_Static_Expression

   --      True for static expressions, as defined in RM-4.9.

   --    Raises_Constraint_Error

   --      This flag indicates that it is known at compile time that the
   --      evaluation of an expression raises constraint error. If the
   --      expression is static, and this flag is off, then it is also known at
   --      compile time that the expression does not raise constraint error
   --      (i.e. the flag is accurate for static expressions, and conservative
   --      for non-static expressions.

   --  See also Is_OK_Static_Expression, which is True for static
   --  expressions that do not raise Constraint_Error. This is used in most
   --  legality checks, because static expressions that raise Constraint_Error
   --  are usually illegal.

   --  See also Compile_Time_Known_Value, which is True for an expression whose
   --  value is known at compile time. In this case, the expression is folded
   --  to a literal or to a constant that is itself (recursively) either a
   --  literal or a constant

   --  Is_[OK_]Static_Expression are used for legality checks, whereas
   --  Compile_Time_Known_Value is used for optimization purposes.

   --  When we are analyzing and evaluating static expressions, we propagate
   --  both flags. Usually if a subexpression raises a Constraint_Error, then
   --  so will its parent expression, and Raise_Constraint_Error will be
   --  propagated to this parent. The exception is conditional cases like
   --  (True or else 1/0 = 0), which results in an expression that has the
   --  Is_Static_Expression flag True, and Raises_Constraint_Error False. Even
   --  though 1/0 would raise an exception, the right operand is never actually
   --  executed, so the expression as a whole does not raise CE.

   --  Finally, the case of static predicates. These are applied only to entire
   --  expressions, not to subexpressions, so we do not have the case of having
   --  to propagate this information. We handle this case simply by resetting
   --  the Is_Static_Expression flag if a static predicate fails. Note that we
   --  can't use this simpler approach for the constraint error case because of
   --  the (True or else 1/0 = 0) example discussed above.

   -------------------------------
   -- Compile-Time Known Values --
   -------------------------------

   --  For most legality checking purposes the flag Is_Static_Expression
   --  defined in Sinfo should be used. This package also provides a routine
   --  called Is_OK_Static_Expression which in addition of checking that an
   --  expression is static in the RM 4.9 sense, it checks that the expression
   --  does not raise constraint error. In fact for certain legality checks not
   --  only do we need to ascertain that the expression is static, but we must
   --  also ensure that it does not raise constraint error.

   --  Neither of Is_Static_Expression and Is_OK_Static_Expression should be
   --  used for compile time evaluation purposes. In fact certain expression
   --  whose value may be known at compile time are not static in the RM 4.9
   --  sense. A typical example is:

   --     C : constant Integer := Record_Type'Size;

   --  The expression 'C' is not static in the technical RM sense, but for many
   --  simple record types, the size is in fact known at compile time. When we
   --  are trying to perform compile time constant folding (for instance for
   --  expressions like C + 1), Is_Static_Expression or Is_OK_Static_Expression
   --  are not the right functions to test if folding is possible. Instead, we
   --  use Compile_Time_Known_Value. All static expressions that do not raise
   --  constraint error (i.e. those for which Is_OK_Static_Expression is true)
   --  are known at compile time, but as shown by the above example, there may
   --  be cases of non-static expressions which are known at compile time.

      Static_Failure_Is_Error : Boolean := False);
   --  Determine whether an arbitrary expression satisfies the static predicate
   --  of a type. The routine does nothing if Expr is not known at compile time
   --  or Typ lacks a static predicate; otherwise it may emit a warning if the
   --  expression is prohibited by the predicate, or if Static_Failure_Is_Error
   --  is True then an error will be flagged. If the expression is a static
   --  expression, it fails a predicate that was not explicitly stated to be
   --  a dynamic predicate, and Static_Failure_Is_Error is False, then an
   --  additional warning is given, and the flag Is_Static_Expression is reset
   --  on Expr.

   procedure Check_Non_Static_Context (N : Node_Id);
   --  Deals with the special check required for a static expression that
   --  appears in a non-static context, i.e. is not part of a larger static
   --  expression (see RM 4.9(35)), i.e. the value of the expression must be
   --  within the base range of the base type of its expected type. A check is
   --  also made for expressions that are inside the base range, but outside
   --  the range of the expected subtype (this is a warning message rather than
   --  an illegality).
   --
   --  Note: most cases of non-static context checks are handled within
   --  Sem_Eval itself, including all cases of expressions at the outer level
   --  (i.e. those that are not a subexpression). The outside customers for
   --  this procedure are Sem_Aggr, Sem_Attr (because Eval_Attribute is there)
   --  and Sem_Res (for a special case arising from ranges, see Resolve_Range).
   --
   --  Note: this procedure is also called by GNATprove on real literals
   --  that are not sub-expressions of static expressions, to convert them to
   --  machine numbers, as GNATprove cannot perform this conversion contrary
   --  to gigi.

   procedure Check_String_Literal_Length (N : Node_Id; Ttype : Entity_Id);
   --  N is either a string literal, or a constraint error node. In the latter
   --  case, the situation is already dealt with, and the call has no effect.
   --  In the former case, if the target type, Ttyp is constrained, then a
   --  check is made to see if the string literal is of appropriate length.

   function Checking_Potentially_Static_Expression return Boolean;

   --  then Diff.all contains No_Uint on return. Rec is a parameter that is set
   --  True for a recursive call from within Compile_Time_Compare to avoid some

   function Compile_Time_Known_Bounds (T : Entity_Id) return Boolean;
   --  If T is an array whose index bounds are all known at compile time, then
   --  True is returned. If T is not an array type, or one or more of its index
   --  bounds is not known at compile time, then False is returned.

   function Compile_Time_Known_Value (Op : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Returns true if Op is an expression not raising Constraint_Error whose
   --  value is known at compile time and for which a call to Expr_Value can
   --  be used to determine this value. This is always true if Op is a static
   --  expression, but can also be true for expressions which are technically
   --  non-static but which are in fact known at compile time. Some examples of
   --  such expressions are the static lower bound of a non-static range or the
   --  value of a constant object whose initial value is itself compile time
   --  known in the sense of this routine. Note that this routine is defended
   --  against unanalyzed expressions. Such expressions will not cause a
   --  blowup, they may cause pessimistic (i.e. False) results to be returned.
   --  In general we take a pessimistic view. False does not mean the value
   --  could not be known at compile time, but True means that absolutely
   --  definition it is known at compile time and it is safe to call
   --  Expr_Value[_XX] on the expression Op.
   --
   --  Note that we don't define precisely the set of expressions that return
   --  True. Callers should not make any assumptions regarding the value that
   --  is returned for non-static expressions. Functional behavior should never
   --  be affected by whether a given non-static expression returns True or
   --  False when this function is called. In other words this is purely for
   --  efficiency optimization purposes. The code generated can often be more
   --  efficient with compile time known values, e.g. range analysis for the
   --  purpose of removing checks is more effective if we know precise bounds.

   --  WARNING: There is a matching C declaration of this subprogram in fe.h

   function CRT_Safe_Compile_Time_Known_Value (Op : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  In the case of configurable run-times, there may be an issue calling
   --  Compile_Time_Known_Value with non-static expressions where the legality
   --  of the program is not well-defined. Consider this example:
   --
   --    X := B ** C;
   --
   --  Now if C is compile time known, and has the value 4, then inline code
   --  can be generated at compile time, instead of calling a run-time routine.
   --  That's fine in the normal case, but when we have a configurable run-time
   --  the run-time routine may not be available. This means that the program
   --  will be rejected if C is not known at compile time. We don't want the
   --  legality of a program to depend on how clever the implementation of this
   --  function is. If the run-time in use lacks the exponentiation routine,
   --  then what we say is that exponentiation is permitted if the exponent is
   --  officially static and has a value in the range 0 .. 4.
   --
   --  In a case like this, we use CRT_Safe_Compile_Time_Known_Value to avoid
   --  this effect. This routine will return False for a non-static expression
   --  if we are in configurable run-time mode, even if the expression would
   --  normally be considered compile-time known.

   --  than the pos value. This is the value that is needed for generating code
   --  sequences, while the Expr_Value value is appropriate for compile time
   --  constraint errors or getting the logical value. Note that this function
   --  does NOT concern itself with biased values, if the caller needs a
   --  properly biased value, the subtraction of the bias must be handled
   --  explicitly.

   function Expr_Value (N : Node_Id) return Uint;

   --  or character literals. In the latter two cases, the value returned is
   --  the Pos value in the relevant enumeration type. It can also be used for
   --  fixed-point values, in which case it returns the corresponding integer

   procedure Why_Not_Static (Expr : Node_Id);
   --  This procedure may be called after generating an error message that
   --  complains that something is non-static. If it finds good reasons, it
   --  generates one or more error messages pointing the appropriate offending
   --  component of the expression. If no good reasons can be figured out, then
   --  no messages are generated. The expectation here is that the caller has
   --  already issued a message complaining that the expression is non-static.
   --  Note that this message should be placed using Error_Msg_F or
   --  Error_Msg_FE, so that it will sort before any messages placed by this
   --  call. Note that it is fine to call Why_Not_Static with something that
   --  is not an expression, and usually this has no effect, but in some cases
   --  (N_Parameter_Association or N_Range), it makes sense for the internal
   --  recursive calls.
   --
   --  Note that these messages are not continuation messages, instead they are
   --  separate unconditional messages, marked with '!'. The reason for this is
   --  that they can be posted at a different location from the main message as
   --  documented above ("appropriate offending component"), and continuation
   --  messages must always point to the same location as the parent message.
