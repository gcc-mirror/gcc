                  --  inherit the alignment, since that's what the RM implies,
                  --  but that leads to complex rules and oddities. Consider
                  --  for example:

                  --    type R is new Character;
                  --    for R'Size use 16;

                  --  It seems quite bogus in this case to inherit an alignment
                  --  of 1 from the parent type Character. Furthermore, if that
                  --  is what the programmer really wanted for some odd reason,
                  --  then he could specify the alignment directly.

                  --  Moreover we really don't want to inherit the alignment in
                  --  the case of a specified Object_Size for a subtype, since
                  --  there would be no way of overriding to give a reasonable
                  --  value (as we don't have an Object_Alignment attribute).
                  --  Consider for example:

                  --    subtype R is Character;
                  --    for R'Object_Size use 16;

                  --  If we inherit the alignment of 1, then it will be very
                  --  inefficient for the subtype and this cannot be fixed.

                  --  So we make the decision that if Size (or Object_Size) is
                  --  given and the alignment is not specified with a clause,
                  --  we reset the alignment to the appropriate value for the
                  --  specified size. This is a nice simple rule to implement
                  --  and document.

                  --  There is a theoretical glitch, which is that a confirming
                  --  size clause could now change the alignment, which, if we
                  --  really think that confirming rep clauses should have no
                  --  effect, could be seen as a no-no. However that's already
                  --  implemented by Alignment_Check_For_Size_Change so we do
                  --  not change the philosophy here.

                  --  odd distinction was made between inherited alignments
                  --  larger than the computed alignment (where the larger
                  --  alignment was inherited) and inherited alignments smaller
                  --  than the computed alignment (where the smaller alignment
                  --  was overridden). This was a dubious fix to get around an
                  --  ACATS problem which seems to have disappeared anyway, and
                  --  in any case, this peculiarity was never documented.
