--  This package contains the routines for supporting the Image attribute for
--  signed integer types up to Size Integer'Size, and also for conversion
--  operations required in Text_IO.Integer_IO for such types.

   pragma Pure;

   procedure Image_Integer
     (V : Integer;
      S : in out String;
      P : out Natural);
   --  Computes Integer'Image (V) and stores the result in S (1 .. P)
   --  setting the resulting value of P. The caller guarantees that S
   --  is long enough to hold the result, and that S'First is 1.

   procedure Set_Image_Integer
     (V : Integer;
      S : in out String;
      P : in out Natural);
   --  Stores the image of V in S starting at S (P + 1), P is updated to point
   --  to the last character stored. The value stored is identical to the value
   --  of Integer'Image (V) except that no leading space is stored when V is
   --  non-negative. The caller guarantees that S is long enough to hold the
   --  result. S need not have a lower bound of 1.
