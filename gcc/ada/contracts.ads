   --    Async_Writers
   --    Depends           (single concurrent object)
   --    Effective_Reads
   --    Effective_Writes
   --    Global            (single concurrent object)

   procedure Analyze_Package_Contract (Pack_Id : Entity_Id);
   --  Analyze all delayed pragmas chained on the contract of package Pack_Id
   --  as if they appeared at the end of a declarative region. The pragmas
   --  that are considered are:
   --
   --    Initial_Condition
   --    Initializes

   procedure Analyze_Protected_Contract (Prot_Id : Entity_Id);
   --  Analyze all delayed pragmas chained on the contract of protected unit
   --  Prot_Id if they appeared at the end of a declarative region. Currently
   --  there are no such pragmas.

   procedure Analyze_Subprogram_Body_Stub_Contract (Stub_Id : Entity_Id);
   --  Analyze all delayed pragmas chained on the contract of subprogram body
   --  stub Stub_Id as if they appeared at the end of a declarative region. The

   --  question are:
   --
   --    Depends
   --    Global

   procedure Create_Generic_Contract (Unit : Node_Id);
   --  Create a contract node for a generic package, generic subprogram, or a
   --  generic body denoted by Unit by collecting all source contract-related
   --  pragmas in the contract of the unit.

   procedure Freeze_Previous_Contracts (Body_Decl : Node_Id);
   --  Freeze the contracts of all source constructs found in the declarative
   --  list which contains entry, package, protected, subprogram, or task body
   --  denoted by Body_Decl. In addition, freeze the contract of the nearest
   --  enclosing package body.

   procedure Inherit_Subprogram_Contract
     (Subp      : Entity_Id;
      From_Subp : Entity_Id);
   --  Inherit relevant contract items from source subprogram From_Subp. Subp
   --  denotes the destination subprogram. The inherited items are:
   --    Extensions_Visible
   --  ??? it would be nice if this routine handles Pre'Class and Post'Class

   procedure Instantiate_Subprogram_Contract (Templ : Node_Id; L : List_Id);
   --  Instantiate all source pragmas found in the contract of the generic
   --  subprogram declaration template denoted by Templ. The instantiated
   --  pragmas are added to list L.

     (Templ  : Node_Id;
      Gen_Id : Entity_Id);
   --  Save all global references found within the aspect specifications and
