   --  At one point, we may also lock the parent, if the parent is different

   --  Since we are holding both the activator's lock, and Task_Wrapper locks
   --  that before it does anything more than initialize the low-level ATCB
   --  components, it should be safe to wait to update the counts until we see
   --  that the thread creation is successful.

   --  If the thread creation fails, we do need to close the entries of the
   --  task. The first phase, of dequeuing calls, only requires locking the
   --  acceptor's ATCB, but the waking up of the callers requires locking the
   --  caller's ATCB. We cannot safely do this while we are holding other
   --  locks. Therefore, the queue-clearing operation is done in a separate

   --  Before we allow the thread to exit, we must clean up. This is a delicate
   --  job. We must wake up the task's master, who may immediately try to
   --  deallocate the ATCB from the current task WHILE IT IS STILL EXECUTING.

   --  To avoid this, the parent task must be blocked up to the latest
   --  statement executed. The trouble is that we have another step that we
   --  also want to postpone to the very end, i.e., calling SSL.Destroy_TSD.
   --  We have to postpone that until the end because compiler-generated code
   --  is likely to try to access that data at just about any point.

   --  We can't call Destroy_TSD while we are holding any other locks, because
   --  it locks Global_Task_Lock, and our deadlock prevention rules require
   --  that to be the outermost lock. Our first "solution" was to just lock
   --  Global_Task_Lock in addition to the other locks, and force the parent to
   --  also lock this lock between its wakeup and its freeing of the ATCB. See
   --  Complete_Task for the parent-side of the code that has the matching
   --  calls to Task_Lock and Task_Unlock. That was not really a solution,
   --  since the operation Task_Unlock continued to access the ATCB after
   --  unlocking, after which the parent was observed to race ahead, deallocate
   --  the ATCB, and then reallocate it to another task. The call to
   --  Undefer_Abort in Task_Unlock by the "terminated" task was overwriting
