   --  not tagged.

   --  Add A to the list of access types to process when expanding the
   --  freeze node of E.

   procedure Add_Block_Identifier (N : Node_Id; Id : out Entity_Id);
   --  Given a block statement N, generate an internal E_Block label and make
   --  it the identifier of the block. Id denotes the generated entity. If the
   --  block already has an identifier, Id returns the entity of its label.

   procedure Add_Global_Declaration (N : Node_Id);
   --  These procedures adds a declaration N at the library level, to be
   --  elaborated before any other code in the unit. It is used for example
   --  for the entity that marks whether a unit has been elaborated. The
   --  declaration is added to the Declarations list of the Aux_Decls_Node
   --  for the current unit. The declarations are added in the current scope,
   --  so the caller should push a new scope as required before the call.

   function Add_Suffix (E : Entity_Id; Suffix : Character) return Name_Id;
   --  Returns the name of E adding Suffix

   function Address_Integer_Convert_OK (T1, T2 : Entity_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Given two types, returns True if we are in Allow_Integer_Address mode

      Check_Typ : Entity_Id);
   --  Checks expression Exp against subtype Check_Typ. If Exp is an aggregate
   --  and Check_Typ a constrained record type with discriminants, we generate
   --  the appropriate discriminant checks. If Exp is an array aggregate then
   --  emit the appropriate length checks. If Exp is a scalar type, or a string
   --  literal, Exp is changed into Check_Typ'(Exp) to ensure that range checks
   --  are performed at run time. Also used for expressions in the argument of
   --  'Update, which shares some of the features of an aggregate.

   function Alignment_In_Bits (E : Entity_Id) return Uint;

   --  Used to implement pragma Restrictions (No_Dynamic_Sized_Objects).
   --  Given a constraint or subtree of a constraint on a composite
   --  subtype/object, returns True if there are no nonstatic constraints,
   --  which might cause objects to be created with dynamic size.
   --  Called for subtype declarations (including implicit ones created for
   --  subtype indications in object declarations, as well as discriminated
   --  record aggregate cases). For record aggregates, only records containing
   --  discriminant-dependent arrays matter, because the discriminants must be
   --  static when governing a variant part. Access discriminants are
   --  irrelevant. Also called for array aggregates, but only named notation,
   --  because those are the only dynamic cases.

   procedure Append_Entity_Name (Buf : in out Bounded_String; E : Entity_Id);
   --  Recursive procedure to construct string for qualified name of enclosing
   --  program unit. The qualification stops at an enclosing scope has no

   --  even in Ada 95, and is not a ? if the message represents an illegality
   --  (because of violation of static expression rules) in Ada 95 (but not
   --  in Ada 83). Typically this routine posts all messages at the Sloc of
   --  node N. However, if Loc /= No_Location, Loc is the Sloc used to output
   --  the message. After posting the appropriate message, and if the flag
   --  Rep is set, this routine replaces the expression with an appropriate
   --  N_Raise_Constraint_Error node using the given Reason code. This node
   --  is then marked as being static if the original node is static, but
   --  sets the flag Raises_Constraint_Error, preventing further evaluation.
   --  The error message may contain a } or & insertion character. This
   --  normally references Etype (N), unless the Ent argument is given
   --  explicitly, in which case it is used instead. The type of the raise
   --  node that is built is normally Etype (N), but if the Typ parameter
   --  is present, this is used instead. Warn is normally False. If it is
   --  True then the message is treated as a warning even though it does
   --  not end with a ? (this is used when the caller wants to parameterize
   --  whether an error or warning is given), or when the message should be
   --  treated as a warning even when SPARK_Mode is On (which otherwise would

   --  If at the point of declaration an array type has a private or limited
   --  component, several array operations are not available on the type, and

   --  the & for the type itself. Note that if Typ is a generic actual type,
   --  then the message will be output as a warning, and a raise Program_Error
   --  is inserted using Insert_Action with node N as the insertion point. Node
   --  N also supplies the source location for construction of the raise node.

   --  Handling of inherited primitives whose ancestors have class-wide
   --  pre/postconditions.

   --  If a primitive operation of a parent type has a class-wide pre/post-
   --  condition that includes calls to other primitives, and that operation
   --  is inherited by a descendant type that also overrides some of these
   --  other primitives, the condition that applies to the inherited
   --  operation has a modified condition in which the overridden primitives
   --  have been replaced by the primitives of the descendent type. A call
   --  to the inherited operation cannot be simply a call to the parent
   --  operation (with an appropriate conversion) as is the case for other
   --  inherited operations, but must appear with a wrapper subprogram to which
   --  the modified conditions apply. Furthermore the call to the parent
   --  operation must not be subject to the original class-wide condition,
   --  given that modified conditions apply. To implement these semantics
   --  economically we create a subprogram body (a "class-wide clone") to
   --  which no pre/postconditions apply, and we create bodies for the
   --  original and the inherited operation that have their respective
   --  pre/postconditions and simply call the clone. The following operations

   --  clone includes the proper conversion in a call the parent operation.

   procedure Build_Class_Wide_Clone_Decl (Spec_Id : Entity_Id);
