   --  not tagged.

   type Accessibility_Level_Kind is
     (Dynamic_Level,
      Object_Decl_Level,
      Zero_On_Dynamic_Level);
   --  Accessibility_Level_Kind is an enumerated type which captures the
   --  different modes in which an accessibility level could be obtained for
   --  a given expression.

   --  When in the context of the function Accessibility_Level,
   --  Accessibility_Level_Kind signals what type of accessibility level to
   --  obtain. For example, when Level is Dynamic_Level, a defining identifier
   --  associated with a SAOOAAT may be returned or an N_Integer_Literal node.
   --  When the level is Object_Decl_Level, an N_Integer_Literal node is
   --  returned containing the level of the declaration of the object if
   --  relevant (be it a SAOOAAT or otherwise). Finally, Zero_On_Dynamic_Level
   --  returns library level for all cases where the accessibility level is
   --  dynamic (used to bypass static accessibility checks in dynamic cases).

   --  Centralized accessibility level calculation routine for finding the
   --  accessibility level of a given expression Expr.

   --  In_Return_Context forces the Accessibility_Level calculations to be
   --  carried out "as if" Expr existed in a return value. This is useful for
   --  calculating the accessibility levels for discriminant associations
   --  and return aggregates.

   --  The Allow_Alt_Model parameter allows the alternative level calculation
   --  under the restriction No_Dynamic_Accessibility_Checks to be performed.

   function Acquire_Warning_Match_String (Str_Lit : Node_Id) return String;
   --  Used by pragma Warnings (Off, string), and Warn_As_Error (string) to get

   procedure Add_Block_Identifier (N : Node_Id; Id : out Entity_Id);
   --  Given a block statement N, generate an internal E_Block label and make
   --  it the identifier of the block. Id denotes the generated entity. If the

   procedure Add_Global_Declaration (N : Node_Id);
   --  These procedures adds a declaration N at the library level, to be
   --  elaborated before any other code in the unit. It is used for example
   --  for the entity that marks whether a unit has been elaborated. The
   --  declaration is added to the Declarations list of the Aux_Decls_Node
   --  for the current unit. The declarations are added in the current scope,
   --  so the caller should push a new scope as required before the call.

   --  Given two types, returns True if we are in Allow_Integer_Address mode
   --  and one of the types is (a descendant of) System.Address (and this type
   --  is private), and the other type is any integer type.

   --  Return the underlying value of the expression N of an address clause

   function Addressable (V : Uint) return Boolean;
   function Addressable (V : Int)  return Boolean;
   pragma Inline (Addressable);
   --  Returns True if the value of V is the word size or an addressable factor
   --  or multiple of the word size (typically 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128).

   procedure Aggregate_Constraint_Checks
     (Exp       : Node_Id;
      Check_Typ : Entity_Id);
   --  Checks expression Exp against subtype Check_Typ. If Exp is an aggregate
   --  and Check_Typ a constrained record type with discriminants, we generate
   --  the appropriate discriminant checks. If Exp is an array aggregate then
   --  emit the appropriate length checks. If Exp is a scalar type, or a string
   --  literal, Exp is changed into Check_Typ'(Exp) to ensure that range checks
   --  are performed at run time. Also used for expressions in the argument of
   --  'Update, which shares some of the features of an aggregate.

   function Alignment_In_Bits (E : Entity_Id) return Uint;
   --  If the alignment of the type or object E is currently known to the
   --  compiler, then this function returns the alignment value in bits.
   --  Otherwise Uint_0 is returned, indicating that the alignment of the
   --  entity is not yet known to the compiler.

   function All_Composite_Constraints_Static (Constr : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Used to implement pragma Restrictions (No_Dynamic_Sized_Objects).
   --  Given a constraint or subtree of a constraint on a composite
   --  subtype/object, returns True if there are no nonstatic constraints,
   --  which might cause objects to be created with dynamic size.
   --  Called for subtype declarations (including implicit ones created for
   --  subtype indications in object declarations, as well as discriminated
   --  record aggregate cases). For record aggregates, only records containing
   --  discriminant-dependent arrays matter, because the discriminants must be
   --  static when governing a variant part. Access discriminants are
   --  irrelevant. Also called for array aggregates, but only named notation,
   --  because those are the only dynamic cases.

   procedure Append_Entity_Name (Buf : in out Bounded_String; E : Entity_Id);
   --  Recursive procedure to construct string for qualified name of enclosing

   --  enclosing wrapper package. The name is appended to Buf.

   procedure Append_Inherited_Subprogram (S : Entity_Id);

   --  N is a subexpression that will raise Constraint_Error when evaluated

   --  exception. The last character is ? if the message is always a warning,
   --  even in Ada 95, and is not a ? if the message represents an illegality
   --  (because of violation of static expression rules) in Ada 95 (but not
   --  in Ada 83). Typically this routine posts all messages at the Sloc of
   --  node N. However, if Loc /= No_Location, Loc is the Sloc used to output
   --  the message. After posting the appropriate message, this routine
   --  replaces the expression with an appropriate N_Raise_Constraint_Error
   --  node using the given Reason code. This node is then marked as being
   --  static if the original node is static, but sets the flag
   --  Raises_Constraint_Error, preventing further evaluation. The error
   --  message may contain a } or & insertion character. This normally
   --  references Etype (N), unless the Ent argument is given explicitly, in
   --  which case it is used instead. The type of the raise node that is built
   --  is normally Etype (N), but if the Typ parameter is present, this is used
   --  instead. Warn is normally False. If it is True then the message is
   --  treated as a warning even though it does not end with a ? (this is used
   --  when the caller wants to parameterize whether an error or warning is
   --  given), or when the message should be treated as a warning even when
   --  SPARK_Mode is On (which otherwise would force an error).
   --  If Emit_Message is False, then do not emit any message.

   --  is inserted using Insert_Action with node N as the insertion point. Node
   --  N also supplies the source location for construction of the raise node.
   --  If Typ does not have any predicates, the call has no effect. Set flag
   --  Suggest_Static when the context warrants an advice on how to avoid the

   --  Handling of inherited primitives whose ancestors have class-wide
   --  pre/postconditions.

   --  If a primitive operation of a parent type has a class-wide pre/post-
   --  condition that includes calls to other primitives, and that operation
   --  is inherited by a descendant type that also overrides some of these
   --  other primitives, the condition that applies to the inherited
   --  operation has a modified condition in which the overridden primitives
   --  have been replaced by the primitives of the descendent type. A call
   --  to the inherited operation cannot be simply a call to the parent
   --  operation (with an appropriate conversion) as is the case for other
   --  inherited operations, but must appear with a wrapper subprogram to which
   --  the modified conditions apply. Furthermore the call to the parent
   --  operation must not be subject to the original class-wide condition,
   --  given that modified conditions apply. To implement these semantics
   --  economically we create a subprogram body (a "class-wide clone") to
   --  which no pre/postconditions apply, and we create bodies for the
   --  original and the inherited operation that have their respective
   --  pre/postconditions and simply call the clone. The following operations
   --  take care of constructing declaration and body of the clone, and
   --  building the calls to it within the appropriate wrappers.

   --  ??? This code used to be pretty much a copy of Build_Subtype, but now

   --  ??? Performance WARNING. The current implementation creates a new itype
   --  for all aggregates whose base type is discriminated. This means that
   --  for record aggregates nested inside an array aggregate we will create
   --  a new itype for each record aggregate if the array component type has
   --  discriminants. For large aggregates this may be a problem. What should
