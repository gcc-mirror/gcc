/* This module provide facilities for clonning functions. I.e. creating
   new functions based on existing functions with simple modifications,
   such as replacement of parameters.

   To allow whole program optimization without actual presence of function
   bodies, an additional infrastructure is provided for so-called virtual
   clones

   A virtual clone in the callgraph is a function that has no
   associated body, just a description of how to create its body based
   on a different function (which itself may be a virtual clone).

   The description of function modifications includes adjustments to
   the function's signature (which allows, for example, removing or
   adding function arguments), substitutions to perform on the
   function body, and, for inlined functions, a pointer to the
   function that it will be inlined into.

   It is also possible to redirect any edge of the callgraph from a
   function to its virtual clone.  This implies updating of the call
   site to adjust for the new function signature.

   Most of the transformations performed by inter-procedural
   optimizations can be represented via virtual clones.  For
   instance, a constant propagation pass can produce a virtual clone
   of the function which replaces one of its arguments by a
   constant.  The inliner can represent its decisions by producing a
   clone of a function whose body will be later integrated into
   a given function.

   Using virtual clones, the program can be easily updated
   during the Execute stage, solving most of pass interactions
   problems that would otherwise occur during Transform.

   Virtual clones are later materialized in the LTRANS stage and
   turned into real functions.  Passes executed after the virtual
   clone were introduced also perform their Transform stage
   on new functions, so for a pass there is no significant
   difference between operating on a real function or a virtual
   clone introduced before its Execute stage.

   Optimization passes then work on virtual clones introduced before
   their Execute stage as if they were real functions.  The
   only difference is that clones are not visible during the
   Generate Summary stage.  */
