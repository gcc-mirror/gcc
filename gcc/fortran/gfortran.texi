@chapter Getting Started

Gfortran is the GNU Fortran 95 compiler front end,
designed initially as a free replacement for,
or alternative to, the unix @command{f95} command;
@command{gfortran} is the command you'll use to invoke the compiler.

Gfortran is still in an early state of development.
@command{gfortran} can generate code for most constructs and expressions,
but much work remains to be done.

When @command{gfortran} is finished,
it will do everything you expect from any decent compiler: 

@itemize @bullet
@item
Read a user's program,
stored in a file and containing instructions written
in Fortran 77, Fortran 90 or Fortran 95.
This file contains @dfn{source code}.

@item
Translate the user's program into instructions a computer
can carry out more quickly than it takes to translate the
instructions in the first
place.  The result after compilation of a program is
@dfn{machine code},
code designed to be efficiently translated and processed
by a machine such as your computer.
Humans usually aren't as good writing machine code
as they are at writing Fortran (or C++, Ada, or Java),
because is easy to make tiny mistakes writing machine code.

@item
Provide the user with information about the reasons why
the compiler is unable to create a binary from the source code.
Usually this will be the case if the source code is flawed.
When writing Fortran, it is easy to make big mistakes.
The Fortran 90 requires that the compiler can point out
mistakes to the user.
An incorrect usage of the language causes an @dfn{error message}.

The compiler will also attempt to diagnose cases where the
user's program contains a correct usage of the language,
but instructs the computer to do something questionable.
This kind of diagnostics message is called a @dfn{warning message}.

@item
Provide optional information about the translation passes
from the source code to machine code.
This can help a user of the compiler to find the cause of
certain bugs which may not be obvious in the source code,
but may be more easily found at a lower level compiler output.
It also helps developers to find bugs in the compiler itself.

@item
Provide information in the generated machine code that can
make it easier to find bugs in the program (using a debugging tool,
called a @dfn{debugger}, such as the GNU Debugger @command{gdb}). 

@item
Locate and gather machine code already generated to
perform actions requested by statements in the user's program.
This machine code is organized into @dfn{modules} and is located
and @dfn{linked} to the user program. 
@end itemize

Gfortran consists of several components:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A version of the @command{gcc} command
(which also might be installed as the system's @command{cc} command)
that also understands and accepts Fortran source code.
The @command{gcc} command is the @dfn{driver} program for
all the languages in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC);
With @command{gcc},
you can compile the source code of any language for
which a front end is available in GCC.

@item
The @command{gfortran} command itself,
which also might be installed as the
system's @command{f95} command.
@command{gfortran} is just another driver program,
but specifically for the Fortran 95 compiler only.
The difference with @command{gcc} is that @command{gfortran}
will automatically link the correct libraries to your program.

@item
A collection of run-time libraries.
These libraries contain the machine code needed to support
capabilities of the Fortran language that are not directly
provided by the machine code generated by the
@command{gfortran} compilation phase,
such as intrinsic functions and subroutines,
and routines for interaction with files and the operating system.
@c and mechanisms to spawn,
@c unleash and pause threads in parallelized code.

@item
The Fortran compiler itself, (@command{f951}).
This is the gfortran parser and code generator,
linked to and interfaced with the GCC backend library.
@command{f951} ``translates'' the source code to
assembler code.  You would typically not use this
program directly;
instead, the @command{gcc} or @command{gfortran} driver
programs will call it for you.

@chapter GFORTRAN and GCC
@cindex GNU Compiler Collection

GCC used to be the GNU ``C'' Compiler,
but is now known as the @dfn{GNU Compiler Collection}.
GCC provides the GNU system with a very versatile
compiler middle end (shared optimization passes),
and back ends (code generators) for many different
computer architectures and operating systems.
The code of the middle end and back end are shared by all
compiler front ends that are in the GNU Compiler Collection.

A GCC front end is essentially a source code parser
and an intermediate code generator.  The code generator translates the
semantics of the source code into a language independent form called
@dfn{GENERIC}.

The parser takes a source file written in a
particular computer language, reads and parses it,
and tries to make sure that the source code conforms to
the language rules.
Once the correctness of a program has been established,
the compiler will build a data structure known as the
@dfn{Abstract Syntax tree},
or just @dfn{AST} or ``tree'' for short.
This data structure represents the whole program
or a subroutine or a function.
The ``tree'' is passed to the GCC middle end,
which will perform optimization passes on it.  The optimized AST is then 
handed off too the back end which assembles the program unit.

Different phases in this translation process can be,
and in fact @emph{are} merged in many compiler front ends.
GNU Fortran 95 has a strict separation between the
parser and code generator.

The goal of the gfortran project is to build a new front end for GCC.
Specifically, a Fortran 95 front end.
In a non-gfortran installation,
@command{gcc} will not be able to compile Fortran 95 source code
(only the ``C'' front end has to be compiled if you want to build GCC,
all other languages are optional).
If you build GCC with gfortran, @command{gcc} will recognize
@file{.f/.f90/.f95} source files and accepts Fortran 95 specific
command line options.

@chapter GFORTRAN and G77
@cindex Fortran 77
@cindex G77

Why do we write a compiler front end from scratch? 
There's a fine Fortran 77 compiler in the
GNU Compiler Collection that accepts some features
of the Fortran 90 standard as extensions.
Why not start from there and revamp it?

One of the reasons is that Craig Burley, the author of G77,
has decided to stop working on the G77 front end.
On @uref{http://world.std.com/~burley/g77-why.html,
Craig explains the reasons for his decision to stop working on G77}
in one of the pages in his homepage.
Among the reasons is a lack of interest in improvements to
@command{g77}.
Users appear to be quite satisfied with @command{g77} as it is.
While @command{g77} is still being maintained (by Toon Moene),
it is unlikely that sufficient people will be willing
to completely rewrite the existing code. 

But there are other reasons to start from scratch.
Many people, including Craig Burley,
no longer agreed with certain design decisions in the G77 front end.
Also, the interface of @command{g77} to the back end is written in
a style which is confusing and not up to date on recommended practice.
In fact, a full rewrite had already been planned for GCC 3.0.

When Craig decided to stop,
it just seemed to be a better idea to start a new project from scratch,
because it was expected to be easier to maintain code we
develop ourselves than to do a major overhaul of @command{g77} first,
and then build a Fortran 95 compiler out of it.

@quotation
As soon as gfortran can parse all of the statements correctly,
it will be in the ``larva'' state.
When we generate code, the ``puppa'' state.
When gfortran is done,
we'll see if it will be a beautiful butterfly,
or just a big bug....

--Andy Vaught, April 2000
@end quotation

The start of the GNU Fortran 95 project was announced on
the GCC homepage in March 18, 2000
(even though Andy had already been working on it for a while,
of course).

Gfortran is currently reaching the stage where is is able to compile real
world programs.  However it is still under development and has many rough
edges.

@section Compiler Status

@table @emph
@item Front end
This is the part of gfortran which parses a source file, verifies that it
is valid Fortran 95, performs compile time replacement of constants
(PARAMETER variables) and reads and generate module files. This is
almost complete. Every Fortran 95 source should be accepted, and most
none-Fortran 95 source should be rejected. If you find a source file where
this is not true, please tell us. You can use the -fsyntax-only switch to
make gfortran quit after running the front end, effectively reducing it to
a syntax checker.

@item Middle end interface
These are the parts of gfortran that take the parse tree generated by the
front end and translate it to the GENERIC form required by the GCC back
end. Work is ongoing in these parts of gfortran, but a large part has
already been completed.
@end table

@node Library Status
@section Library Status

Some intrinsic functions map directly to library functions, and in most
cases the name of the library function used depends on the type of the
arguments.  For some intrinsics we generate inline code, and for others,
such as sin, cos and sqrt, we rely on the backend to use special
instructions in the floating point unit of the CPU if available, or to
fall back to a call to libm if these are not available.

Implementation of some non-elemental intrinsic functions (eg. DOT_PRODUCT,
AVERAGE) is not yet optimal. This is hard because we have to make decisions
whether to use inline code (good for small arrays as no function call
overhead occurs) or generate function calls (good for large arrays as it
allows use of hand-optimized assembly routines, SIMD instructions, etc.)

The IO library is in a mostly usable state.  Unformatted I/O for
@code{REAL(KIND=10)} variables is currently not recommended.

Array intrinsics mostly work.

@node Proposed Extensions
@section Proposed Extensions

Here's a list of proposed extensions for @command{gfortran}, in no particular
order.  Most of these are necessary to be fully compatible with
existing Fortran compilers, but they are not part of the official
J3 Fortran 95 standard.

@subsection Compiler extensions: 
@itemize @bullet
@item
Flag for defining the kind number for default logicals.

@item
User-specified alignment rules for structures.
@item
Flag to generate @code{Makefile} info.

@item
Automatically extend single precision constants to double.

@item
Compile code that conserves memory by dynamically allocating common and
module storage either on stack or heap.

@item
Flag to cause the compiler to distinguish between upper and lower case
names.  The Fortran 95 standard does not distinguish them.

@item
Compile flag to generate code for array conformance checking (suggest -CC).

@item
User control of symbol names (underscores, etc).

@item
Compile setting for maximum size of stack frame size before spilling
parts to static or heap.

@item
Flag to force local variables into static space.

@item
Flag to force local variables onto stack.

@item
Flag to compile lines beginning with ``D''.

@item
Flag to ignore lines beginning with ``D''.

@item
Flag for maximum errors before ending compile.

@item
Generate code to check for null pointer dereferences -- prints locus of
dereference instead of segfaulting.  There was some discussion about this
option in the g95 development mailing list.

@item
Allow setting the default unit number.

@item
Option to initialize otherwise uninitialized integer and floating
point variables.

@item
Support for OpenMP directives.  This also requires support from the runtime
library and the rest of the compiler.

@item
Support for Fortran 200x. This includes several new features including
floating point exceptions, extended use of allocatable arrays, C
interoperability, Parameterizer data types and function pointers.

@cindex Extension

@command{gfortran} implements a number of extensions over standard
Fortran. This chapter contains information on their syntax and
meaning.  There are currently two categories of @command{gfortran}
extensions, those that provide functionality beyond that provided
by any standard, and those that are supported by @command{gfortran}
purely for backward compatibility with legacy compilers.  By default,
@option{-std=gnu} allows the compiler to accept both types of
extensions, but to warn about the use of the latter.  Specifying
either @option{-std=f95} or @option{-std=f2003} disables both types
of extensions, and @option{-std=legacy} allows both without warning.

@node Old-style kind specifications
@section Old-style kind specifications
@cindex Kind specifications

@command{gfortran} allows old-style kind specifications in
declarations. These look like:
@smallexample
      TYPESPEC*k x,y,z
@end smallexample
where @code{TYPESPEC} is a basic type, and where @code{k} is a valid kind
number for that type. The statement then declares @code{x}, @code{y}
and @code{z} to be of type @code{TYPESPEC} with kind @code{k}. In
other words, it is equivalent to the standard conforming declaration
@smallexample
      TYPESPEC(k) x,y,z
@end smallexample

@node Old-style variable initialization
@section Old-style variable initialization
@cindex Initialization

@command{gfortran} allows old-style initialization of variables of the
form:
@smallexample
      INTEGER*4 i/1/,j/2/
      REAL*8 x(2,2) /3*0.,1./
@end smallexample
These are only allowed in declarations without double colons
(@code{::}), as these were introduced in Fortran 90 which also
introduced a new syntax for variable initializations. The syntax for
the individual initializers is as for the @code{DATA} statement, but
unlike in a @code{DATA} statement, an initializer only applies to the
variable immediately preceding. In other words, something like
@code{INTEGER I,J/2,3/} is not valid.

Examples of standard conforming code equivalent to the above example, are:
@smallexample
! Fortran 90
      INTEGER(4) :: i = 1, j = 2
      REAL(8) :: x(2,2) = RESHAPE((/0.,0.,0.,1./),SHAPE(x))
! Fortran 77
      INTEGER  i, j
      DOUBLE PRECISION x(2,2)
      DATA i,j,x /1,2,3*0.,1./
@end smallexample

@node Extensions to namelist
@section Extensions to namelist
@cindex Namelist

@command{gfortran} fully supports the Fortran 95 standard for namelist I/O
including array qualifiers, substrings and fully qualified derived types.
The output from a namelist write is compatible with namelist read.  The
output has all names in upper case and indentation to column 1 after the
namelist name.  Two extensions are permitted:

Old-style use of $ instead of &
@smallexample
$MYNML
 X(:)%Y(2) = 1.0 2.0 3.0
 CH(1:4) = "abcd"
$END
@end smallexample

It should be noticed that the default terminator is / rather than &END.

Querying of the namelist when inputting from stdin. After at least
one space, entering ? sends to stdout the namelist name and the names of
the variables in the namelist:
@smallexample
?

&mynml
 x
 x%y
 ch
&end
@end smallexample

Entering =? outputs the namelist to stdout, as if WRITE (*,NML = mynml)
had been called:
@smallexample
=?

&MYNML
 X(1)%Y=  0.000000    ,  1.000000    ,  0.000000    ,
 X(2)%Y=  0.000000    ,  2.000000    ,  0.000000    ,
 X(3)%Y=  0.000000    ,  3.000000    ,  0.000000    ,
 CH=abcd,  /
@end smallexample

To aid this dialog, when input is from stdin, errors send their
messages to stderr and execution continues, even if IOSTAT is set.

PRINT namelist is permitted.  This causes an error if -std=f95 is used.
@smallexample
PROGRAM test_print
  REAL, dimension (4)  ::  x = (/1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0/)
  NAMELIST /mynml/ x
  PRINT mynml
END PROGRAM test_print
@end smallexample

@node X format descriptor
@section X format descriptor
@cindex X format descriptor

To support legacy codes, @command{gfortran} permits the count field
of the X edit descriptor in FORMAT statements to be omitted.  When
omitted, the count is implicitly assumed to be one.

@smallexample
       PRINT 10, 2, 3
10     FORMAT (I1, X, I1)
@end smallexample

@node Commas in FORMAT specifications
@section Commas in FORMAT specifications
@cindex Commas in FORMAT specifications

To support legacy codes, @command{gfortran} allows the comma separator
to be omitted immediately before and after character string edit
descriptors in FORMAT statements.

@smallexample
       PRINT 10, 2, 3
10     FORMAT ('FOO='I1' BAR='I2)
@end smallexample

@node I/O item lists
@section I/O item lists
@cindex I/O item lists

To support legacy codes, @command{gfortran} allows the input item list
of the READ statement, and the output item lists of the WRITE and PRINT
statements to start with a comma.

@node Hexadecimal constants
@section Hexadecimal constants
@cindex Hexadecimal constants

As a GNU extension, @command{gfortran} allows hexadecimal constants to
be specified using the X prefix, in addition to the standard Z prefix.

@node Real array indices
@section Real array indices
@cindex Real array indices

As a GNU extension, @command{gfortran} allows arrays to be indexed using
real types, whose values are implicitly converted to integers.

@node Unary operators
@section Unary operators
@cindex Unary operators

As a GNU extension, @command{gfortran} allows unary plus and unary
minus operators to appear as the second operand of binary arithmetic
operators without the need for parenthesis.

@smallexample
       X = Y * -Z
@end smallexample

@node Implicitly interconvert LOGICAL and INTEGER
@section Implicitly interconvert LOGICAL and INTEGER
@cindex Implicitly interconvert LOGICAL and INTEGER

As a GNU extension for backwards compatibility with other compilers,
@command{gfortran} allows the implicit conversion of LOGICALs to INTEGERs
and vice versa.  When converting from a LOGICAL to an INTEGER, the numeric
value of @code{.FALSE.} is zero, and that of @code{.TRUE.} is one.  When
converting from INTEGER to LOGICAL, the value zero is interpreted as
@code{.FALSE.} and any nonzero value is interpreted as @code{.TRUE.}.

@smallexample
       INTEGER*4 i
       i = .FALSE.
@end smallexample

@node Hollerith constants support
@section Hollerith constants support
@cindex Hollerith constants

A Hollerith constant is a string of characters preceded by the letter @samp{H}
or @samp{h}, and there must be an literal, unsigned, nonzero default integer
constant indicating the number of characters in the string. Hollerith constants
are stored as byte strings, one character per byte.

@command{gfortran} supports Hollerith constants. They can be used as the right
hands in the @code{DATA} statement and @code{ASSIGN} statement, also as the
arguments. The left hands can be of Integer, Real, Complex and Logical type.
The constant will be padded or trancated to fit the size of left hand.

Valid Hollerith constants examples:
@smallexample
complex*16 x(2)
data x /16Habcdefghijklmnop, 16Hqrstuvwxyz012345/
call foo (4H abc)
x(1) = 16Habcdefghijklmnop
@end smallexample

Invalid Hollerith constants examples:
@smallexample
integer*4 a
a = 8H12345678 ! The Hollerith constant is too long. It will be truncated.
a = 0H         ! At least one character needed.
@end smallexample

@node Cray pointers
@section Cray pointers
@cindex Cray pointers

Cray pointers are part of a non-standard extension that provides a
C-like pointer in Fortran.  This is accomplished through a pair of
variables: an integer "pointer" that holds a memory address, and a
"pointee" that is used to dereference the pointer.

Pointer/pointee pairs are declared in statements of the form:
@smallexample
        pointer ( <pointer> , <pointee> )
@end smallexample
or,
@smallexample
        pointer ( <pointer1> , <pointee1> ), ( <pointer2> , <pointee2> ), ...
@end smallexample
The pointer is an integer that is intended to hold a memory address.
The pointee may be an array or scalar.  A pointee can be an assumed
size array -- that is, the last dimension may be left unspecified by
using a '*' in place of a value -- but a pointee cannot be an assumed
shape array.  No space is allocated for the pointee.

The pointee may have its type declared before or after the pointer
statement, and its array specification (if any) may be declared
before, during, or after the pointer statement.  The pointer may be
declared as an integer prior to the pointer statement.  However, some
machines have default integer sizes that are different than the size
of a pointer, and so the following code is not portable:
@smallexample
        integer ipt
        pointer (ipt, iarr)
@end smallexample
If a pointer is declared with a kind that is too small, the compiler
will issue a warning; the resulting binary will probably not work
correctly, because the memory addresses stored in the pointers may be
truncated.  It is safer to omit the first line of the above example;
if explicit declaration of ipt's type is omitted, then the compiler
will ensure that ipt is an integer variable large enough to hold a
pointer.

Pointer arithmetic is valid with Cray pointers, but it is not the same
as C pointer arithmetic.  Cray pointers are just ordinary integers, so
the user is responsible for determining how many bytes to add to a
pointer in order to increment it.  Consider the following example:
@smallexample
        real target(10)
        real pointee(10)
        pointer (ipt, pointee)
        ipt = loc (target)
        ipt = ipt + 1       
@end smallexample
The last statement does not set ipt to the address of
@code{target(1)}, as one familiar with C pointer arithmetic might
expect.  Adding 1 to ipt just adds one byte to the address stored in
ipt.

Any expression involving the pointee will be translated to use the
value stored in the pointer as the base address.

To get the address of elements, this extension provides an intrinsic
function loc(), loc() is essentially the C '&' operator, except the
address is cast to an integer type:
@smallexample
        real ar(10)
        pointer(ipt, arpte(10))
        real arpte
        ipt = loc(ar)  ! Makes arpte is an alias for ar
        arpte(1) = 1.0 ! Sets ar(1) to 1.0
@end smallexample
The pointer can also be set by a call to a malloc-type
function.  There is no malloc intrinsic implemented as part of the
Cray pointer extension, but it might be a useful future addition to
@command{gfortran}.  Even without an intrinsic malloc function,
dynamic memory allocation can be combined with Cray pointers by
calling a short C function:
@smallexample
mymalloc.c:

        void mymalloc_(void **ptr, int *nbytes)
        @{
            *ptr = malloc(*nbytes);
            return;
        @}

caller.f:

        program caller
        integer ipinfo;
        real*4 data
        pointer (ipdata, data(1024))
        call mymalloc(ipdata,4*1024)
        end
@end smallexample
Cray pointees often are used to alias an existing variable.  For
example:
@smallexample
        integer target(10)
        integer iarr(10)
        pointer (ipt, iarr)
        ipt = loc(target)
@end smallexample
As long as ipt remains unchanged, iarr is now an alias for target.
The optimizer, however, will not detect this aliasing, so it is unsafe
to use iarr and target simultaneously.  Using a pointee in any way
that violates the Fortran aliasing rules or assumptions is illegal.
It is the user's responsibility to avoid doing this; the compiler
works under the assumption that no such aliasing occurs.

Cray pointers will work correctly when there is no aliasing (i.e.,
when they're used to access a dynamically allocated block of memory),
and also in any routine where a pointee is used, but any variable with
which it shares storage is not used.  Code that violates these rules
may not run as the user intends.  This is not a bug in the optimizer;
any code that violates the aliasing rules is illegal.  (Note that this
is not unique to gfortran; any Fortran compiler that supports Cray
pointers will ``incorrectly'' optimize code with illegal aliasing.)

There are a number of restrictions on the attributes that can be
applied to Cray pointers and pointees.  Pointees may not have the
attributes ALLOCATABLE, INTENT, OPTIONAL, DUMMY, TARGET, EXTERNAL,
INTRINSIC, or POINTER.  Pointers may not have the attributes
DIMENSION, POINTER, TARGET, ALLOCATABLE, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC.
Pointees may not occur in more than one pointer statement.  A pointee
cannot be a pointer.  Pointees cannot occur in equivalence, common, or
data statements.

A pointer may be modified during the course of a program, and this
will change the location to which the pointee refers.  However, when
pointees are passed as arguments, they are treated as ordinary
variables in the invoked function.  Subsequent changes to the pointer
will not change the base address of the array that was passed.

Free software is only possible if people contribute to efforts
to create it.
We're always in need of more people helping out with ideas
and comments, writing documentation and contributing code.

If you want to contribute to GNU Fortran 95,
have a look at the long lists of projects you can take on.
Some of these projects are small,
some of them are large;
some are completely orthogonal to the rest of what is
happening on @command{gfortran},
but others are ``mainstream'' projects in need of enthusiastic hackers.
All of these projects are important!
We'll eventually get around to the things here,
but they are also things doable by someone who is willing and able.
