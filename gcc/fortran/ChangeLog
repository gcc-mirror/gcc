	PR fortran/67451
	PR fortran/69418
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_copy_class_to_class): For coarrays just the
	pointer is passed.  Take it as is without trying to deref the
	_data component.
	* trans-stmt.c (gfc_trans_allocate): Take care of coarrays as
	argument to source=-expression.

2016-01-30  Bud Davis  <jmdavis@link.com>
	    Mikael Morin  <mikael@gcc.gnu.org>

	Backport from trunk.
	PR fortran/59746
	* symbol.c (gfc_restore_last_undo_checkpoint): Delete
	a common block symbol if it was put in the list.

2016-01-28  Janus Weil  <janus@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR fortran/69484
	* invoke.texi: Fix documentation of -Wall with respect to -Wtabs.

2016-01-28  Andre Vehreschild  <vehre@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR fortran/62536
	* decl.c: Prevent setting gfc_current_ns to NULL when block statement's
	nesting is incomplete.  There is already an error conditon, so having
	gfc_current_ns pointing to an eventually wrong namespace does not matter
	that much.

2016-01-27  Andre Vehreschild  <vehre@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR fortran/p69268
	* trans-stmt.c (gfc_trans_allocate): Make sure the source=
	expression is evaluated once only. Use gfc_trans_assignment ()
	instead of explicitly calling gfc_trans_string_copy () to
	reduce the code complexity in trans_allocate.

2016-01-25  Dominique d'Humieres <dominiq@lps.ens.fr>

	PR fortran/68283
	* primary.c (gfc_variable_attr): revert revision r221955,
	call gfc_internal_error only if there is no error.

2016-01-17  Mikael Morin  <mikael@gcc.gnu.org>
	    Dominique d'Humieres  <dominiq@lps.ens.fr>

	Backport from trunk.
	PR fortran/61831
	* trans-array.c (gfc_conv_array_parameter): Guard allocatable
	component deallocation code generation with descriptorless
	calling convention flag.
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_conv_expr_reference): Remove allocatable
	component deallocation code generation from revision 212329.
	(expr_may_alias_variables): New function.
	(gfc_conv_procedure_call): New boolean elemental_proc to factor
	check for procedure elemental-ness.  Rename boolean f to nodesc_arg
	and declare it in the outer scope.  Use expr_may_alias_variables,
	elemental_proc and nodesc_arg to decide whether generate allocatable
	component deallocation code.
	(gfc_trans_subarray_assign): Set deep copy flag.

2016-01-17  Paul Thomas  <pault@gcc.gnu.org>

	Backport from trunk.
	PR fortran/66082
	* trans-array.c (gfc_conv_array_parameter): Ensure that all
	non-variable arrays with allocatable components have the
	components deallocated after the procedure call.

2016-01-10  Paul Thomas  <pault@gcc.gnu.org>

	Update copyright years in updated files.

	PR fortran/50221
	PR fortran/68216
	PR fortran/63932
	PR fortran/66408
	* trans_array.c (gfc_conv_scalarized_array_ref): Pass the
	symbol decl for deferred character length array references.
	* trans-stmt.c (gfc_trans_allocate): Keep the string lengths
	to update deferred length character string lengths.
	* trans-types.c (gfc_get_dtype_rank_type); Use the string
	length of deferred character types for the dtype size.
	* trans.c (gfc_build_array_ref): For references to deferred
	character arrays, use the domain max value, if it is a variable
	to set the 'span' and use pointer arithmetic for acces to the
	element.
	(trans_code): Set gfc_current_locus for diagnostic purposes.

	PR fortran/67674
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_conv_procedure_call): Do not fix deferred
	string lengths of components.

	PR fortran/49954
	* resolve.c (deferred_op_assign): New function.
	(gfc_resolve_code): Call it.
	* trans-array.c (concat_str_length): New function.
	(gfc_alloc_allocatable_for_assignment): Jump directly to alloc/
	realloc blocks for deferred character length arrays because the
	string length might change, even if the shape is the same. Call
	concat_str_length to obtain the string length for concatenation
	since it is needed to compute the lhs string length.
	Set the descriptor dtype appropriately for the new string
	length.
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_trans_assignment_1): Fix the rse string
	length for all characters, other than deferred types. For
	concatenation operators, push the rse.pre block to the inner
	most loop so that the temporary pointer and the assignments
	are properly placed.

	PR fortran/67779
	* trans_array.c (gfc_conv_scalarized_array_ref): Add missing
	se->use_offset from condition for calculation of 'base'.
