2016-01-19  Martin Jambor  <mjambor@suse.cz>

	* types.def (BT_FN_VOID_UINT_PTR_INT_PTR): New.

2016-01-15  Paul Thomas  <pault@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR fortran/64324
	* resolve.c (check_uop_procedure): Prevent deferred length
	characters from being trapped by assumed length error.

	PR fortran/49630
	PR fortran/54070
	PR fortran/60593
	PR fortran/60795
	PR fortran/61147
	PR fortran/64324
	* trans-array.c (gfc_conv_scalarized_array_ref): Pass decl for
	function as well as variable expressions.
	(gfc_array_init_size): Add 'expr' as an argument. Use this to
	correctly set the descriptor dtype for deferred characters.
	(gfc_array_allocate): Add 'expr' to the call to
	'gfc_array_init_size'.
	* trans.c (gfc_build_array_ref): Expand logic for setting span
	to include indirect references to character lengths.
	* trans-decl.c (gfc_get_symbol_decl): Ensure that deferred
	result char lengths that are PARM_DECLs are indirectly
	referenced both for directly passed and by reference.
	(create_function_arglist): If the length type is a pointer type
	then store the length as the 'passed_length' and make the char
	length an indirect reference to it.
	(gfc_trans_deferred_vars): If a character length has escaped
	being set as an indirect reference, return it via the 'passed
	length'.
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_conv_procedure_call): The length of
	deferred character length results is set TREE_STATIC and set to
	zero.
	(gfc_trans_assignment_1): Do not fix the rse string_length if
	it is a variable, a parameter or an indirect reference. Add the
	code to trap assignment of scalars to unallocated arrays.
	* trans-stmt.c (gfc_trans_allocate): Remove 'def_str_len' and
	all references to it. Instead, replicate the code to obtain a
	explicitly defined string length and provide a value before
	array allocation so that the dtype is correctly set.
	trans-types.c (gfc_get_character_type): If the character length
	is a pointer, use the indirect reference.

	(OMPWS_NOWAIT): Renumber.
	* trans-stmt.c (gfc_trans_where_3): Only set OMPWS_SCALARIZER_WS
	if OMPWS_SCALARIZER_BODY is not set already, and set also
	OMPWS_SCALARIZER_BODY until the final loop creation.
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_trans_assignment_1): Likewise.
	* trans-openmp.c (gfc_trans_omp_workshare): Also clear
	OMPWS_SCALARIZER_BODY.
	* trans-array.c (gfc_trans_scalarized_loop_end): Don't create
