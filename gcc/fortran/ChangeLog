	Update copyright years in updated files.

	PR fortran/50221
	PR fortran/68216
	PR fortran/63932
	PR fortran/66408
	* trans_array.c (gfc_conv_scalarized_array_ref): Pass the
	symbol decl for deferred character length array references.
	* trans-stmt.c (gfc_trans_allocate): Keep the string lengths
	to update deferred length character string lengths.
	* trans-types.c (gfc_get_dtype_rank_type); Use the string
	length of deferred character types for the dtype size.
	* trans.c (gfc_build_array_ref): For references to deferred
	character arrays, use the domain max value, if it is a variable
	to set the 'span' and use pointer arithmetic for acces to the
	element.
	(trans_code): Set gfc_current_locus for diagnostic purposes.

	PR fortran/67674
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_conv_procedure_call): Do not fix deferred
	string lengths of components.

	PR fortran/49954
	* resolve.c (deferred_op_assign): New function.
	(gfc_resolve_code): Call it.
	* trans-array.c (concat_str_length): New function.
	(gfc_alloc_allocatable_for_assignment): Jump directly to alloc/
	realloc blocks for deferred character length arrays because the
	string length might change, even if the shape is the same. Call
	concat_str_length to obtain the string length for concatenation
	since it is needed to compute the lhs string length.
	Set the descriptor dtype appropriately for the new string
	length.
	* trans-expr.c (gfc_trans_assignment_1): Fix the rse string
	length for all characters, other than deferred types. For
	concatenation operators, push the rse.pre block to the inner
	most loop so that the temporary pointer and the assignments
	are properly placed.

	PR fortran/67779
	* trans_array.c (gfc_conv_scalarized_array_ref): Add missing
	se->use_offset from condition for calculation of 'base'.
