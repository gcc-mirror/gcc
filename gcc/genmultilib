# This shell script produces a header file which the gcc driver
# program uses to pick which library to use based on the machine
# specific options that it is given.

# The first argument is a list of sets of options.  The elements in
# the list are separated by spaces.  Within an element, the options
# are separated by slashes or pipes.  No leading dash is used on the
# options.
# Each option in a set separated by slashes is mutually incompatible
# with all other options
# in the set.
# Each option in a set separated by pipes will be used for the library
# compilation and any of the options in the set will be sufficient
# for it to be triggered.

# The optional second argument is a list of subdirectory names.  If
# the second argument is non-empty, there must be as many elements in
# the second argument as there are options in the first argument.  The
# elements in the second list are separated by spaces.  If the second
# argument is empty, the option names will be used as the directory
# names.

# The optional third argument is a list of options which are
# identical.  The elements in the list are separated by spaces.  Each
# element must be of the form OPTION=OPTION.  The first OPTION should
# appear in the first argument, and the second should be a synonym for
# it.  Question marks are replaced with equal signs in both options.

# The optional fourth argument is a list of multilib directory 
# combinations that should not be built.

# The optional fifth argument is a list of options that should be
# used whenever building multilib libraries.

# The optional sixth argument is a list of exclusions used internally by
# the compiler similar to exceptions. The difference being that exclusions
# allow matching default options that genmultilib does not know about and
# is done at runtime as opposed to being sorted out at compile time.
# Each element in the list is a separate exclusion rule. Each rule is
# a list of options (sans preceding '-') separated by a '/'. The options
# on the rule are grouped as an AND operation, and all options much match
# for the rule to exclude a set. Options can be preceded with a '!' to
# match a logical NOT.

# The optional seventh argument is a list of OS subdirectory names.
# The format is either the same as of the second argument, or a set of
# mappings. When it is the same as the second argument, it describes
# the multilib directories using OS conventions, rather than GCC
# conventions.  When it is a set of mappings of the form gccdir=osdir,
# the left side gives the GCC convention and the right gives the
# equivalent OS defined location.  If the osdir part begins with a !,
# the os directory names are used exclusively.  Use the mapping when
# there is no one-to-one equivalence between GCC levels and the OS.

# The optional eighth argument which intends to reduce the effort to write
# so many MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS rules. This option defines a series of option
# combinations that we actually required.
# For some cases, the generated option combinations are far more than what
# we need, we have to write a lot of rules to screen out combinations we
# don't need. If we missed some rules, the unexpected libraries will be built.
# Now with this argument, one can simply give what combinations are needed.
# It is pretty straigtforward.
# This argument can be used together with MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS and will take
# effect after the MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS.

# The optional ninth argument is the multiarch name.

# The optional tenth argument specifies how to reuse multilib for different
# option sets.

# The last option should be "yes" if multilibs are enabled.  If it is not
# "yes", all GCC multilib dir names will be ".".

# The output looks like
#   #define MULTILIB_MATCHES "\
#   SUBDIRECTORY OPTIONS;\
#   ...
#   "
# The SUBDIRECTORY is the subdirectory to use.  The OPTIONS are
# multiple options separated by spaces.  Each option may start with an
# exclamation point.  gcc will consider each line in turn.  If none of
# the options beginning with an exclamation point are present, and all
# of the other options are present, that subdirectory will be used.
# The order of the subdirectories is such that they can be created in
# order; that is, a subdirectory is preceded by all its parents.

# Here is an example (this is from the actual sparc64 case):
#   genmultilib 'm64/m32 mno-app-regs|mcmodel=medany' '64 32 alt'
#		'mcmodel?medany=mcmodel?medmid' 'm32/mno-app-regs* m32/mcmodel=*'
#		'' 'm32/!m64/mno-app-regs m32/!m64/mcmodel=medany'
#		'../lib64 ../lib32 alt' '' '' '' yes
# This produces:
#   ". !m64 !m32 !mno-app-regs !mcmodel=medany;",
#   "64:../lib64 m64 !m32 !mno-app-regs !mcmodel=medany;",
#   "32:../lib32 !m64 m32 !mno-app-regs !mcmodel=medany;",
#   "alt !m64 !m32 mno-app-regs mcmodel=medany;",
#   "alt !m64 !m32 mno-app-regs !mcmodel=medany;",
#   "alt !m64 !m32 !mno-app-regs mcmodel=medany;",
#   "64/alt:../lib64/alt m64 !m32 mno-app-regs mcmodel=medany;",
#   "64/alt:../lib64/alt m64 !m32 mno-app-regs !mcmodel=medany;",
#   "64/alt:../lib64/alt m64 !m32 !mno-app-regs mcmodel=medany;",
#
# The effect is that `gcc -mno-app-regs' (for example) will append "alt"
# to the directory name when searching for libraries or startup files and
# `gcc -m32 -mcmodel=medany' (for example) will append "32/alt". Also note
# that exclusion above is moot, unless the compiler had a default of -m32,
# which would mean that all of the "alt" directories (not the 64/alt ones)
# would be ignored (not generated, nor used) since the exclusion also
# matches the multilib_default args.

# Copy the positional parameters into variables.
