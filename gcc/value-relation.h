// This file provides access to a relation oracle which can be used to
// maintain and query relations and equivalences between SSA_NAMES.
//
// The general range_query object provided in value-query.h provides
// access to an oracle, if one is available, via the oracle() method.
// Thre are also a couple of access routines provided, which even if there is
// no oracle, will return the default VREL_VARYING no relation.
//
// Typically, when a ranger object is active, there will be an oracle, and
// any information available can be directly queried.  Ranger also sets and
// utilizes the relation information to enhance it's range calculations, this
// is totally transparent to the client, and they are free to make queries.
//
//
// relation_kind is a typedef of enum tree_code, but has restricted range
// and a couple of extra values.
//
// A query is made requesting the relation between SSA1 and SSA@ in a basic
// block, or on an edge, the possible return values are:
//
//  EQ_EXPR, NE_EXPR, LT_EXPR, LE_EXPR, GT_EXPR, and GE_EXPR mean the same.
//  VREL_VARYING : No relation between the 2 names.
//  VREL_UNDEFINED : Impossible relation (ie, A < B && A > B)
//
// The oracle maintains EQ_EXPR relations with equivalency sets, so if a
// relation comes back EQ_EXPR, it is also possible to query the set of
// equivlaencies.  These are basically bitmaps over ssa_names.
//
// Relations are maintained via the dominace trees and are optimized assuming
// they are registered in dominance order.   When a new relation is added, it
// is intersected with whatever existing relation exists in the dominance tree
// and registered at the specified block.


// Rather than introduce a new enumerated type for relations, we can use the
// existing tree_codes for relations, plus add a couple of #defines for
// the other cases.  These codes are arranged such that VREL_VARYING is the
// first code, and all the rest are contiguous.
