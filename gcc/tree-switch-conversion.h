/* A GIMPLE switch statement can be expanded to a short sequence of bit-wise
comparisons.  "switch(x)" is converted into "if ((1 << (x-MINVAL)) & CST)"
where CST and MINVAL are integer constants.  This is better than a series
of compare-and-banch insns in some cases,  e.g. we can implement:

	if ((x==4) || (x==6) || (x==9) || (x==11))

as a single bit test:

	if ((1<<x) & ((1<<4)|(1<<6)|(1<<9)|(1<<11)))

This transformation is only applied if the number of case targets is small,
if CST constains at least 3 bits, and "1 << x" is cheap.  The bit tests are
performed in "word_mode".

The following example shows the code the transformation generates:

	int bar(int x)
	{
		switch (x)
		{
		case '0':  case '1':  case '2':  case '3':  case '4':
		case '5':  case '6':  case '7':  case '8':  case '9':
		case 'A':  case 'B':  case 'C':  case 'D':  case 'E':
		case 'F':
			return 1;
		}
		return 0;
	}

==>

	bar (int x)
	{
		tmp1 = x - 48;
		if (tmp1 > (70 - 48)) goto L2;
		tmp2 = 1 << tmp1;
		tmp3 = 0b11111100000001111111111;
		if ((tmp2 & tmp3) != 0) goto L1 ; else goto L2;
	L1:
		return 1;
	L2:
		return 0;
	}

TODO: There are still some improvements to this transformation that could
be implemented:

* A narrower mode than word_mode could be used if that is cheaper, e.g.
  for x86_64 where a narrower-mode shift may result in smaller code.

* The compounded constant could be shifted rather than the one.  The
  test would be either on the sign bit or on the least significant bit,
  depending on the direction of the shift.  On some machines, the test
  for the branch would be free if the bit to test is already set by the
  shift operation.

     Switch initialization conversion

must be constant and known at compile time and a default branch must be
provided.  For example, the following code:

	int a,b;

	switch (argc)

	 case 1:
	 case 2:
		a_1 = 8;
		b_1 = 6;
		break;

		a_2 = 9;
		b_2 = 5;
		break;
	 case 12:
		a_3 = 10;
		b_3 = 4;
		break;
	 default:
		a_4 = 16;
		b_4 = 1;
		break;
	}
	a_5 = PHI <a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4>
	b_5 = PHI <b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4>


is changed into:

	static const int = CSWTCH01[] = {6, 6, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4};
	static const int = CSWTCH02[] = {8, 8, 9, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16,
				 16, 16, 10};

	if (((unsigned) argc) - 1 < 11)
	  {
	    a_6 = CSWTCH02[argc - 1];
	    b_6 = CSWTCH01[argc - 1];
	  }
	else
	  {
	    a_7 = 16;
	    b_7 = 1;
	  }
	a_5 = PHI <a_6, a_7>
	b_b = PHI <b_6, b_7>

There are further constraints.  Specifically, the range of values across all
case labels must not be bigger than param_switch_conversion_branch_ratio
(default eight) times the number of the actual switch branches.
