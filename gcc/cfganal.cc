   unreachable by inverted traversal from the exit.
   i.e. there's no control flow path from ENTRY to EXIT
   that contains this BB.
   This can happen in two cases - if there's an infinite loop
   or if there's a block that has no successor
   (call to a function with no return).
   Some RTL passes deal with this condition by
   calling connect_infinite_loops_to_exit () and/or
   add_noreturn_fake_exit_edges ().
   However, those methods involve modifying the CFG itself
   which may not be desirable.
   Hence, we deal with the infinite loop/no return cases
   by identifying a unique basic block that can reach all blocks
   in such a region by inverted traversal.
   This function returns a basic block that guarantees
   that all blocks in the region are reachable
   by starting an inverted traversal from the returned block.  */

/* Compute the reverse top sort order of the inverted CFG

   This ordering can be used for forward dataflow problems among others.

   Optionally if START_POINTS is specified, start from exit block and all
   basic blocks in START_POINTS.  This is used by CD-DCE.

   This function assumes that all blocks in the CFG are reachable
   from the ENTRY (but not necessarily from EXIT).

   If there's an infinite loop,
   a simple inverted traversal starting from the blocks
   with no successors can't visit all blocks.
   To solve this problem, we first do inverted traversal
   starting from the blocks with no successor.
   And if there's any block left that's not visited by the regular
   inverted traversal from EXIT,
   those blocks are in such problematic region.
   Among those, we find one block that has
   any visited predecessor (which is an entry into such a region),
   and start looking for a "dead end" from that block
   and do another inverted traversal from that block.  */

/* Compute dominance frontiers, ala Harvey, Ferrante, et al.

   This algorithm can be found in Timothy Harvey's PhD thesis, at
   http://www.cs.rice.edu/~harv/dissertation.pdf in the section on iterative
   dominance algorithms.

   First, we identify each join point, j (any node with more than one
   incoming edge is a join point).

   We then examine each predecessor, p, of j and walk up the dominator tree
   starting at p.

   We stop the walk when we reach j's immediate dominator - j is in the
   dominance frontier of each of  the nodes in the walk, except for j's
   immediate dominator. Intuitively, all of the rest of j's dominators are
   shared by j's predecessors as well.
   Since they dominate j, they will not have j in their dominance frontiers.

   The number of nodes touched by this algorithm is equal to the size
   of the dominance frontiers, no more, no less.
