/* Unwind the different macro expansions that lead to the token which
   location is WHERE and emit diagnostics showing the resulting
   unwound macro expansion trace.  Let's look at an example to see how
   the trace looks like.  Suppose we have this piece of code,
   artificially annotated with the line numbers to increase
   legibility:

    $ cat -n test.c
      1    #define OPERATE(OPRD1, OPRT, OPRD2) \
      2      OPRD1 OPRT OPRD2;
      3
      4    #define SHIFTL(A,B) \
      5      OPERATE (A,<<,B)
      6
      7    #define MULT(A) \
      8      SHIFTL (A,1)
      9
     10    void
     11    g ()
     12    {
     13      MULT (1.0);// 1.0 << 1; <-- so this is an error.
     14    }

   Here is the diagnostic that we want the compiler to generate:

    test.c: In function ‘g’:
    test.c:5:14: error: invalid operands to binary << (have ‘double’ and ‘int’)
    test.c:2:9: note: in definition of macro 'OPERATE'
    test.c:8:3: note: in expansion of macro 'SHIFTL'
    test.c:13:3: note: in expansion of macro 'MULT'

   The part that goes from the third to the fifth line of this
   diagnostic (the lines containing the 'note:' string) is called the
   unwound macro expansion trace.  That's the part generated by this
   function.  */
