/* This file implements the well known algorithm from Lengauer and Tarjan
   to compute the dominators in a control flow graph.  A basic block D is said
   to dominate another block X, when all paths from the entry node of the CFG
   to X go also over D.  The dominance relation is a transitive reflexive
   relation and its minimal transitive reduction is a tree, called the
   dominator tree.  So for each block X besides the entry block exists a
   block I(X), called the immediate dominator of X, which is the parent of X
   in the dominator tree.

   The algorithm computes this dominator tree implicitly by computing for
   each block its immediate dominator.  We use tree balancing and path
   compression, so it's the O(e*a(e,v)) variant, where a(e,v) is the very
   slowly growing functional inverse of the Ackerman function.  */

/*  Given a dominator tree, we can determine whether one thing
    dominates another in constant time by using two DFS numbers:

    1. The number for when we visit a node on the way down the tree
    2. The number for when we visit a node on the way back up the tree

    You can view these as bounds for the range of dfs numbers the
    nodes in the subtree of the dominator tree rooted at that node
    will contain.

    The dominator tree is always a simple acyclic tree, so there are
    only three possible relations two nodes in the dominator tree have
    to each other:

    1. Node A is above Node B (and thus, Node A dominates node B)

     A
     |
     C
    / \
   B   D


   In the above case, DFS_Number_In of A will be <= DFS_Number_In of
   B, and DFS_Number_Out of A will be >= DFS_Number_Out of B.  This is
   because we must hit A in the dominator tree *before* B on the walk
   down, and we will hit A *after* B on the walk back up

   2. Node A is below node B (and thus, node B dominates node A)


     B
     |
     A
    / \
   C   D

   In the above case, DFS_Number_In of A will be >= DFS_Number_In of
   B, and DFS_Number_Out of A will be <= DFS_Number_Out of B.

   This is because we must hit A in the dominator tree *after* B on
   the walk down, and we will hit A *before* B on the walk back up

   3. Node A and B are siblings (and thus, neither dominates the other)

     C
     |
     D
    / \
   A   B

   In the above case, DFS_Number_In of A will *always* be <=
   DFS_Number_In of B, and DFS_Number_Out of A will *always* be <=
   DFS_Number_Out of B.  This is because we will always finish the dfs
   walk of one of the subtrees before the other, and thus, the dfs
   numbers for one subtree can't intersect with the range of dfs
   numbers for the other subtree.  If you swap A and B's position in
   the dominator tree, the comparison changes direction, but the point
   is that both comparisons will always go the same way if there is no
   dominance relationship.

   Thus, it is sufficient to write

   A_Dominates_B (node A, node B)
   {
     return DFS_Number_In(A) <= DFS_Number_In(B)
            && DFS_Number_Out (A) >= DFS_Number_Out(B);

     [3]  K. D. Cooper, T. J. Harvey and K. Kennedy: A Simple, Fast Dominance
	  Algorithm

     First, we use the following heuristics to decrease the size of the BBS
     set:
       a) if BB has a single predecessor, then its immediate dominator is this
	  predecessor
       additionally, if CONSERVATIVE is true:
       b) if all the predecessors of BB except for one (X) are dominated by BB,
	  then X is the immediate dominator of BB
       c) if the nearest common ancestor of the predecessors of BB is X and
	  X -> BB is an edge in CFG, then X is the immediate dominator of BB

     Then, we need to establish the dominance relation among the basic blocks
     in BBS.  We split the dominance tree by removing the immediate dominator
     edges from BBS, creating a forest F.  We form a graph G whose vertices
     are BBS and ENTRY and X -> Y is an edge of G if there exists an edge
     X' -> Y in CFG such that X' belongs to the tree of the dominance forest
     whose root is X.  We then determine dominance tree of G.  Note that
     for X, Y in BBS, X dominates Y in CFG if and only if X dominates Y in G.
     In this step, we can use arbitrary algorithm to determine dominators.
     We decided to prefer the algorithm [3] to the algorithm of
     Lengauer and Tarjan, since the set BBS is usually small (rarely exceeding
     10 during gcc bootstrap), and [3] should perform better in this case.

     Finally, we need to determine the immediate dominators for the basic
     blocks of BBS.  If the immediate dominator of X in G is Y, then
     the immediate dominator of X in CFG belongs to the tree of F rooted in
     Y.  We process the dominator tree T of G recursively, starting from leaves.
     Suppose that X_1, X_2, ..., X_k are the sons of Y in T, and that the
     subtrees of the dominance tree of CFG rooted in X_i are already correct.
     Let G' be the subgraph of G induced by {X_1, X_2, ..., X_k}.  We make
     the following observations:
       (i) the immediate dominator of all blocks in a strongly connected
	   component of G' is the same
       (ii) if X has no predecessors in G', then the immediate dominator of X
	    is the nearest common ancestor of the predecessors of X in the
	    subtree of F rooted in Y
     Therefore, it suffices to find the topological ordering of G', and
     process the nodes X_i in this order using the rules (i) and (ii).
     Then, we contract all the nodes X_i with Y in G, so that the further
     steps work correctly.  */
