/* Unroll and Jam transformation
   
   This is a combination of two transformations, where the second
   is not always valid.  It's applicable if a loop nest has redundancies
   over the iterations of an outer loop while not having that with
   an inner loop.

   Given this nest:
       for (i) {
	 for (j) {
	   B(i,j)
	 }
       }

   first unroll:
       for (i by 2) {
	 for (j) {
	   B(i,j)
	 }
	 for (j) {
	   B(i+1,j)
	 }
       }

   then fuse the two adjacent inner loops resulting from that:
       for (i by 2) {
	 for (j) {
	   B(i,j)
	   B(i+1,j)
	 }
       }

   As the order of evaluations of the body B changes this is valid
   only in certain situations: all distance vectors need to be forward.
   Additionally if there are multiple induction variables than just
   a counting control IV (j above) we can also deal with some situations.

   The validity is checked by unroll_jam_possible_p, and the data-dep
   testing below.

   A trivial example where the fusion is wrong would be when
   B(i,j) == x[j-1] = x[j];
       for (i by 2) {
	 for (j) {
	   x[j-1] = x[j];
	 }
	 for (j) {
	   x[j-1] = x[j];
	 }
       }  effect: move content to front by two elements
       -->
       for (i by 2) {
	 for (j) {
	   x[j-1] = x[j];
	   x[j-1] = x[j];
	 }
       }  effect: move content to front by one element
