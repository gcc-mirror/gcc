/* This pass looks for loops that could be simplified if certain loop
   invariant conditions were true.  It is effectively a form of loop
   splitting in which the pass produces the split conditions itself,
   instead of using ones that are already present in the IL.

   Versioning for when strides are 1
   ---------------------------------

   At the moment the only thing the pass looks for are memory references
   like:

     for (auto i : ...)
       ...x[i * stride]...

   It considers changing such loops to:

     if (stride == 1)
       for (auto i : ...)    [A]
	 ...x[i]...
     else
       for (auto i : ...)    [B]
	 ...x[i * stride]...

   This can have several benefits:

   (1) [A] is often easier or cheaper to vectorize than [B].

   (2) The scalar code in [A] is simpler than the scalar code in [B]
       (if the loops cannot be vectorized or need an epilogue loop).

   (3) We might recognize [A] as a pattern, such as a memcpy or memset.

   (4) [A] has simpler address evolutions, which can help other passes
       like loop interchange.

   The optimization is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in
   Fortran, where the stride of the innermost dimension depends on the
   array descriptor but is often equal to 1 in practice.  For example:

     subroutine f1(x)
       real :: x(:)
       x(:) = 100
     end subroutine f1

   generates the equivalent of:

     raw_stride = *x.dim[0].stride;
     stride = raw_stride != 0 ? raw_stride : 1;
     x_base = *x.data;
     ...
     tmp1 = stride * S;
     tmp2 = tmp1 - stride;
     *x_base[tmp2] = 1.0e+2;

   but in the common case that stride == 1, the last three statements
   simplify to:

     tmp3 = S + -1;
     *x_base[tmp3] = 1.0e+2;

   The optimization is in principle very simple.  The difficult parts are:

   (a) deciding which parts of a general address calculation correspond
       to the inner dimension of an array, since this usually isn't explicit
       in the IL, and for C often isn't even explicit in the source code

   (b) estimating when the transformation is worthwhile

   Structure
   ---------

   The pass has four phases:

   (1) Walk through the statements looking for and recording potential
       versioning opportunities.  Stop if there are none.

   (2) Use context-sensitive range information to see whether any versioning
       conditions are impossible in practice.  Remove them if so, and stop
       if no opportunities remain.

       (We do this only after (1) to keep compile time down when no
       versioning opportunities exist.)

   (3) Apply the cost model.  Decide which versioning opportunities are
       worthwhile and at which nesting level they should be applied.

   (4) Attempt to version all the loops selected by (3), so that:

	 for (...)
	   ...

       becomes:

	 if (!cond)
	   for (...) // Original loop
	     ...
	 else
	   for (...) // New loop
	     ...

       Use the version condition COND to simplify the new loop.  */

/* Try to identify loop strides in ADDRESS and try to choose realistic
   versioning opportunities based on these strides.

   The main difficulty here isn't finding strides that could be used
   in a version check (that's pretty easy).  The problem instead is to
   avoid versioning for some stride S that is unlikely ever to be 1 at
   runtime.  Versioning for S == 1 on its own would lead to unnecessary
   code bloat, while adding S == 1 to more realistic version conditions
   would lose the optimisation opportunity offered by those other conditions.

   For example, versioning for a stride of 1 in the Fortran code:

     integer :: a(:,:)
     a(1,:) = 1

   is not usually a good idea, since the assignment is iterating over
   an outer dimension and is relatively unlikely to have a stride of 1.
   (It isn't impossible, since the inner dimension might be 1, or the
   array might be transposed.)  Similarly, in:

     integer :: a(:,:), b(:,:)
     b(:,1) = a(1,:)

   b(:,1) is relatively likely to have a stride of 1 while a(1,:) isn't.
   Versioning for when both strides are 1 would lose most of the benefit
   of versioning for b's access.

   The approach we take is as follows:

   - Analyze each term to see whether it has an identifiable stride,
     regardless of which loop applies the stride.

   - Evaluate the likelihood that each such stride is for the innermost
     dimension of an array, on the scale "likely", "don't know" or "unlikely".

   - If there is a single "likely" innermost stride, and that stride is
     applied in the loop that contains STMT, version the loop for when the
     stride is 1.  This deals with the cases in which we're fairly
     confident of doing the right thing, such as the b(:,1) reference above.

   - If there are no "likely" innermost strides, and the loop that contains
     STMT uses a stride that we rated as "don't know", version for when
     that stride is 1.  This is principally used for C code such as:

       for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
	 a[i * x] = ...;

     and:

       for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
	 for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
	   a[i * x + j * y] = ...;

     where nothing in the way "x" and "y" are set gives a hint as to
     whether "i" iterates over the innermost dimension of the array.
     In these situations it seems reasonable to assume the
     programmer has nested the loops appropriately (although of course
     there are examples like GEMM in which this assumption doesn't hold
     for all accesses in the loop).

     This case is also useful for the Fortran equivalent of the
     above C code.  */

	      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
		for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
		  a[j][i * stride] += 1;

	      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
		for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
		  a[i][j] += b[i * stride];

	    in cases where b[i * stride] cannot (yet) be hoisted for
