/* Instruction reorganization pass.

   This pass runs after register allocation and final jump
   optimization.  It should be the last pass to run before peephole.
   It serves primarily to fill delay slots of insns, typically branch
   and call insns.  Other insns typically involve more complicated
   interactions of data dependencies and resource constraints, and
   are better handled by scheduling before register allocation (by the
   function `schedule_insns').

   The Branch Penalty is the number of extra cycles that are needed to
   execute a branch insn.  On an ideal machine, branches take a single
   cycle, and the Branch Penalty is 0.  Several RISC machines approach
   branch delays differently:

   The MIPS has a single branch delay slot.  Most insns
   (except other branches) can be used to fill this slot.  When the
   slot is filled, two insns execute in two cycles, reducing the
   branch penalty to zero.

   The SPARC always has a branch delay slot, but its effects can be
   annulled when the branch is not taken.  This means that failing to
   find other sources of insns, we can hoist an insn from the branch
   target that would only be safe to execute knowing that the branch
   is taken.

   The HP-PA always has a branch delay slot.  For unconditional branches
   its effects can be annulled when the branch is taken.  The effects
   of the delay slot in a conditional branch can be nullified for forward
   taken branches, or for untaken backward branches.  This means
   we can hoist insns from the fall-through path for forward branches or
   steal insns from the target of backward branches.

   The TMS320C3x and C4x have three branch delay slots.  When the three
   slots are filled, the branch penalty is zero.  Most insns can fill the
   delay slots except jump insns.

   Three techniques for filling delay slots have been implemented so far:

   (1) `fill_simple_delay_slots' is the simplest, most efficient way
   to fill delay slots.  This pass first looks for insns which come
   from before the branch and which are safe to execute after the
   branch.  Then it searches after the insn requiring delay slots or,
   in the case of a branch, for insns that are after the point at
   which the branch merges into the fallthrough code, if such a point
   exists.  When such insns are found, the branch penalty decreases
   and no code expansion takes place.

   (2) `fill_eager_delay_slots' is more complicated: it is used for
   scheduling conditional jumps, or for scheduling jumps which cannot
   be filled using (1).  A machine need not have annulled jumps to use
   this strategy, but it helps (by keeping more options open).
   `fill_eager_delay_slots' tries to guess the direction the branch
   will go; if it guesses right 100% of the time, it can reduce the
   branch penalty as much as `fill_simple_delay_slots' does.  If it
   guesses wrong 100% of the time, it might as well schedule nops.  When
   `fill_eager_delay_slots' takes insns from the fall-through path of
   the jump, usually there is no code expansion; when it takes insns
   from the branch target, there is code expansion if it is not the
   only way to reach that target.

   (3) `relax_delay_slots' uses a set of rules to simplify code that
   has been reorganized by (1) and (2).  It finds cases where
   conditional test can be eliminated, jumps can be threaded, extra
   insns can be eliminated, etc.  It is the job of (1) and (2) to do a
   good job of scheduling locally; `relax_delay_slots' takes care of
   making the various individual schedules work well together.  It is
   especially tuned to handle the control flow interactions of branch
   insns.  It does nothing for insns with delay slots that do not
   branch.

   On machines that use CC0, we are very conservative.  We will not make
   a copy of an insn involving CC0 since we want to maintain a 1-1
   correspondence between the insn that sets and uses CC0.  The insns are
   allowed to be separated by placing an insn that sets CC0 (but not an insn
   that uses CC0; we could do this, but it doesn't seem worthwhile) in a
   delay slot.  In that case, we point each insn at the other with REG_CC_USER
   and REG_CC_SETTER notes.  Note that these restrictions affect very few
   machines because most RISC machines with delay slots will not use CC0
   (the RT is the only known exception at this point).  */

/* Find a label at the end of the function or before a RETURN.  If there

   The property of such a label is that it is placed just before the

   turned into a jump to the label unconditionally.  In particular, the
   label cannot be placed before a RETURN insn with a filled delay slot.

   ??? There may be a problem with the current implementation.  Suppose
   we start with a bare RETURN insn and call find_end_label.  It may set
   function_return_label just before the RETURN.  Suppose the machinery
   is able to fill the delay slot of the RETURN insn afterwards.  Then
   function_return_label is no longer valid according to the property
   described above and find_end_label will still return it unmodified.
   Note that this is probably mitigated by the following observation:
   once function_return_label is made, it is very likely the target of

   until it hits a label and sees if it finds an insn with an identical
   pattern.  Only in this (relatively rare) event does it check for
   data conflicts.
