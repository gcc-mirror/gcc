	Re-implement the pass that lowers trees generated by
	the UPC front-end into GENERIC.  Previously this was
	done within the gimplification framework, but this
	required that gimplification be run before inlining
	and various other passes, which did not fit in well
	with the current design of the middle-end passes.
	Now, the lowering is done by a newly defined language
	specific genericize hook.  With this change, we are
	are able to undo some extensions made to the gimplify
	logic, and thus can revert several files to trunk.

	  (upc_gimplify_lval): call upc_gimplify_real_image_ref to
	  rewrite UPC shared REALPART_EXPR and IMAGPART_EXPR lvalues.
	  This will avoid an ICE when compiling regular "C"
	  code that refers to those operators.

2011-04-13  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-cmd.c: Do not add "-isystem <libupc_path>" if
	  -fno-upc-pre-include is asserted.

2011-03-22  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-cmd.c: Move linker switches into libupc/libupc.spec.
	  (UPC_LINKER_SCRIPT, LIBNUMA, LIBUPC, LIBUPC_PT) Remove.
	  (find_ld_script) Remove.

2011-03-20  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Call error() directly with a format specifier,
	  rather than using sprintf() to format the message.
	  This should make it easier to internationalize UPC's error messages.

2011-03-20  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Move UPC start files, end files, and linker specs.
	into libupc.  This reduces the impact on common GCC
	configuration files, and ensures that these UPC-specific
	components are only built when the UPC language dialect is selected.

	* config-lang.in: Remove setting of 'upc_extra_parts', which
	  was used to specify which upc-crtbegin and upc-crtend files
	  need to built.  Remove extraneous (commented out)
	  settings of 'cfiles'.  The listed configuration files
	  have been reverted to trunk, and weren't referenced
	  via cfiles in any event.

	* upc/upc-cmd.c: Remove test for HAVE_UPC_LINK_SCRIPT.
	  Simply test for the presence of the UPC link script
	  in the current directory or the libupc directory.
	  Add -B<path-to-libupc> to the switches passed to 'gcc';
	  this is needed in order to find the upc-crtbegin
	  and upc-crtend object files now built in libupc.
	  Remove test for and inclusion of UPC_LINKER_SWITCHES.
	  if extra switches are needed for a particular target
	  (like SGI/Irix), they will be defined by the custom
	  linker spec. built in libupc.  Remove test for
	  HAVE_UPC_NUMA_SUPPORT; if '-lnuma' is needed, it
	  will be added to the custom linker specs. built
	  in libupc.

	* upc-crtstuff.c: Move to libupc.

2011-02-22  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c (upc_diagnose_deprecated_stmt): New.
	  upc-act.h (upc_diagnose_deprecated_stmt): Define.
	  Check usage of deprecated keywords and issue
	  error message.

2011-02-08  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-pts-struct.c: Fix bug: (pts + int) fails when int is negative
	  for struct-pts representation

	  Analysis indicated that for something like (+ ptr -80) this was
	  being represented as (+ ptr (- 80)) and further, when the
	  calculations were propagated into the individual operations on the
	  components of the 'struct' pointer, it would end up with something
	  like (+ ptr.vaddr (- 80)), and the type of (- 80) would end up as
	  "long unsigned int" because of the addition to the pointer.  This
	  caused the calculations involving the signed 'int' operand to be
	  performed incorrectly.  This fix insures that the 'int' operand is
	  signed.

2011-01-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Fix behavior of upc_localsizeof() when called in a dynamic
	threads compilation environment.  This bug, and the expected
	behavior is documented in this bug report:
	https://upc-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2960.
	* upc_act.c (upc_localsizeof): Re-implement.

2010-12-15  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Merge trunk version 167307 into gupc branch.
	* upc_act.h: (upc_handle_option) add location and struct
	cl_option_handlers * parameters.
	(upc_finish_file) Remove.
	(upc_write_global_declarations) New, replaces upc_finish_file.
	* lang-spec.h: Disable multi-file compilation for .upc files.
	This fixes an issue where file-scoped static variables were
	diagnosed as multiply-defined.  Both "C" and "ObjC" also disable
	multi-file compilation.
	* upc-gimplify.c: (upc_expand_put) Check for INDIRECT_REF_P()
	explicitly when deciding whether a UPC shared object is addressable.
	is_gimple_addressable() used to do this, but now checks for MEM_REF
	which does not apply to UPC shared objects.
	(upc_gimplify_lval, upc_gimplify_expr) Delete references to
	ALIGN_INDIRECT_REF and MISALIGNED_INDIRECT_REF.
	These are no longer defined.
	(upc_genericize) Add call to bitmap_obstack_initialize()
	and bitmap_obstack_release() around call to gimplify_function_tree().
	* upc-lang.c: Add #include of "opts.h" and "options.h".
	(flag_upc_debug, flag_upc_inline_lib, flag_upc_instrument,
	flag_upc_instrument_functions) Remove.  Use definitions
	generated by the options file.
	(upc_init_options) Use cl_decoded_option struct.
	(LANG_HOOKS_WRITE_GLOBALS) Define as upc_write_global_declarations.
	(finish_file) Delete.
	(upc_init_options) Call control_warning_option() to specify
	-Werror=pointer-arith as the default.  Remove call to
	enable_warning_as_error().
	* upc-pts-struct.c: (upc_pts_init_type) Move test that
	UPC_PTS_THREAD_SIZE is a multiple of a byte into an "if" statement
	rather than an #ifdef; this macro now depends upon a
	target size macro which must be evaluated at runtime.
	* Make-lang.in: (cc1-dummy) Remove make target.
	(cc1upc-checksum.c) Generate directly from object files.
	* upc-cmd.c: (SWITCH_TAKES_ARG, WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG) Delete
	references to these deprecated macro definitions.
	(GCC_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG, GCC_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG) New.
	(all_exec_args) Delete variable.
	(exec_args) Re-define as (const char *).
	(exec_arg_list) New.  Make copy of exec_args to pass to 'exec'.
	* upc-act.c: (upc_handle_option) Update argument list to accept
	(cl_option_handlers *) argument.
	(upc_finish_file) Rename to upc_write_global_declarations.
	(upc_write_global_declarations) New.

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Issue a compilation error on attempts to perform
	  arithmetic on generic pointer-to-shared values.

	  (The rest of this update is a small code clean up.)

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-lang.c: For UPC only, issue errors for arithmetic and related
	  operations on void types.

	  This update simulates the effect of -Werror=pointer-arith, thus
	  causing arithmetic on void types, sizeof(void) and so on to be
	  considered compilation errors.  This meets the expectations of some
	  harness tests and the RTED/CTED test suites.  GCC is more
	  permissive, but since this is for UPC only, we can fairly safely
	  define this new policy.

2010-10-16  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Fix bug: Static initialization of shared
	  arrays is unsupported -- issue an error message.

	  Currently, static initialization of a shared array is not
	  implemented correctly.

	  We do not plan to fix this for a while, therefore the compiler will
	  issue an error message indicating that this is an unsupported
	  operation.

2010-10-13  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Fix bug: negative layout qualifiers not diagnosed
	  as an error.

	  The CTED_UPC test c_A_1_3_b.upc, specified a negative blocksize, but
	  it was not diagnosed as an error.  With this fix, negative block
	  sizes will generate a translation error.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Fix bug: ICE: Attempt to take the difference of
	  shared and non-shared pointers

	  The compiler detected the error, and then tried to return
	  error_mark_node.  This apparently is not acceptable, as there is an
	  explicit assertion check to prevent this from happening in
	  build_binary_op.  Return the more user-friendly size_one_node
	  instead.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Fix bug: segfault on incomplete array definition.

	  This turned out to be a bit complicated.   The logic in
	  upc_lang_layout_decl had to be re-arranged to avoid trying to lookup
	  the THREADS identifier in the case where the blocking factor has
	  been set to indefinite ([]).  This can happen when indefinite array
	  declarations are processed for shared arrays.  At that time, the
	  file scope has been closed and THREADS is no longer in scope.  Some
	  more work is needed on upc_lang_layout_decl().  It has some
	  duplication, and notably duplicates the two branches of the if
	  having to do with TYPE_SIZE and TYPE_SIZE_UNIT, that appear in the
	  caller of this routine (layout_decl()).

	  The method of forcing a layout qualifier of [] in the indefinite
	  declaration handler is odd a well.  The code that just does the
	  setting of the block factor, needs to moved into its own routine
	  that doesn't depend upon a declspec for '[]' to be passed in, just
	  in order to set the blocking factor to some value (in this case, 0).
	  Also, the logic for how that shared type is constructed is strange.
	  First the type with 0 blocking factor is set.  Then the shared
	  qualifier is removed from the type, and then added back later.  The
	  intermediate type has a blocking factor set, but it has no shared
	  qualifier.  Fixing this will require some thought.  It is tempting
	  just to make indefinite shared arrays an error, rather than forcing
	  the dimension to be '1'.

	  This likely fixes a serious error in the previous update to
	  upc_lang_layout_decl(), where it didn't have the logic to set
	  TYPE_SIZE_UNIT() in the main part of the 'if' statement.  This means
	  the previous update would fail on many tests.

2010-10-01  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-manpage.html, upc.1: Update manual page, and bug reporting
	  URL.

	  Update "man" page to reflect debugging switches.  Also, some general
	  clean up.  Change the bug reporting URL to point to gccupc.org.

2010-10-01  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Do not zap all qualifier bits when constructing a
	  non-shared result node.

	  This fix was suggested by Paul H. in the following Berkeley Bugzilla
	  report: https://upc-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2061 The
	  use of "!" rather than "~" zapped all the type qualifier bits rather
	  than just those that are related to the "shared" qualifier.  This
	  fix clears only the relevant bits.

2010-09-26  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Fix bug: upc_forall with empty clauses
	  mis-diagnosed as syntax error.

	  A failure was exhibited by the Berkeley test case,
	  bug873a.upc, which has the code:
	       double d;
	       upc_forall (;;;d) {...} The compiler did not properly handle
	  the empty "condition" clause, and did not recover well when it was
	  determined that the use of a double value, "d" above, was neither a
	  pointer-to-shared nor an integer expression.  The update implements a
	  fix for both issues.

2010-09-25  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-pts-struct.c: Fix an ICE on 32-bit/struct target: failed
	  gimple check when calculating affinity for upc_forall.

	  Intrepid test, test10.upc, failed to compile due a mis-match between
	  the COMPONENT_REF node and the internal 'thread' field.  Changed the
	  code to make the types agree, and added a conversion to sizetype if
	  necessary.

2010-09-23  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c: Fix bug: ICE: '[*]' layout factor applied to array
	  with static threads and size not a multiple of threads.

	  Add an extra check for an attempt to apply a '[*]' layout qualifier
	  to a shared array that does not specify a size that is a multiple of
	  THREADS, when compiled in a static THREADS compilation environment.

2010-09-22  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc-act.c, upc-act.h: Fix bug: Nested upc_forall() semantics
	  are not implemented

	  The checkforall test in the Berkeley harness test suite indicated
	  that GCC/UPC was not properly implementing nested upc_forall
	  semantics.  Nested upc_forall statements (both statically or
	  dynamically nested) must implement their affinity clause as if it
	  were "continue"; thus all steps in the loop must execute without
	  regard for affinity.  To implement these semantics a global depth
	  counter, __upc_forall_depth, is maintained by the generated code
	  that implements upc_forall.
