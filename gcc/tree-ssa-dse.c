/* This file implements dead store elimination.

   A dead store is a store into a memory location which will later be
   overwritten by another store without any intervening loads.  In this
   case the earlier store can be deleted.

   In our SSA + virtual operand world we use immediate uses of virtual
   operands to detect dead stores.  If a store's virtual definition
   is used precisely once by a later store to the same location which
   post dominates the first store, then the first store is dead.

   The single use of the store's virtual definition ensures that
   there are no intervening aliased loads and the requirement that
   the second load post dominate the first ensures that if the earlier
   store executes, then the later stores will execute before the function
   exits.

   It may help to think of this as first moving the earlier store to
   the point immediately before the later store.  Again, the single
   use of the virtual definition and the post-dominance relationship
   ensure that such movement would be safe.  Clearly if there are
   back to back stores, then the second is redundant.

   Reviewing section 10.7.2 in Morgan's "Building an Optimizing Compiler"
   may also help in understanding this code since it discusses the
   relationship between dead store and redundant load elimination.  In
   fact, they are the same transformation applied to different views of
   the CFG.  */
