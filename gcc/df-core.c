/*
OVERVIEW:

The files in this collection (df*.c,df.h) provide a general framework
for solving dataflow problems.  The global dataflow is performed using
a good implementation of iterative dataflow analysis.

The file df-problems.c provides problem instance for the most common
dataflow problems: reaching defs, upward exposed uses, live variables,
uninitialized variables, def-use chains, and use-def chains.  However,
the interface allows other dataflow problems to be defined as well.

Dataflow analysis is available in most of the rtl backend (the parts
between pass_df_initialize and pass_df_finish).  It is quite likely
that these boundaries will be expanded in the future.  The only
requirement is that there be a correct control flow graph.

There are three variations of the live variable problem that are
available whenever dataflow is available.  The LR problem finds the
areas that can reach a use of a variable, the UR problems finds the
areas that can be reached from a definition of a variable.  The LIVE
problem finds the intersection of these two areas.

There are several optional problems.  These can be enabled when they
are needed and disabled when they are not needed.

Dataflow problems are generally solved in three layers.  The bottom
layer is called scanning where a data structure is built for each rtl
insn that describes the set of defs and uses of that insn.  Scanning
is generally kept up to date, i.e. as the insns changes, the scanned
version of that insn changes also.  There are various mechanisms for
making this happen and are described in the INCREMENTAL SCANNING
section.

In the middle layer, basic blocks are scanned to produce transfer
functions which describe the effects of that block on the global
dataflow solution.  The transfer functions are only rebuilt if the
some instruction within the block has changed.

The top layer is the dataflow solution itself.  The dataflow solution
is computed by using an efficient iterative solver and the transfer
functions.  The dataflow solution must be recomputed whenever the
control changes or if one of the transfer function changes.


USAGE:

Here is an example of using the dataflow routines.

      df_[chain,live,note,rd]_add_problem (flags);

      df_set_blocks (blocks);

      df_analyze ();

      df_dump (stderr);

      df_finish_pass (false);

DF_[chain,live,note,rd]_ADD_PROBLEM adds a problem, defined by an
instance to struct df_problem, to the set of problems solved in this
instance of df.  All calls to add a problem for a given instance of df
must occur before the first call to DF_ANALYZE.

Problems can be dependent on other problems.  For instance, solving
def-use or use-def chains is dependent on solving reaching
definitions. As long as these dependencies are listed in the problem
definition, the order of adding the problems is not material.
Otherwise, the problems will be solved in the order of calls to
df_add_problem.  Note that it is not necessary to have a problem.  In
that case, df will just be used to do the scanning.



DF_SET_BLOCKS is an optional call used to define a region of the
function on which the analysis will be performed.  The normal case is
to analyze the entire function and no call to df_set_blocks is made.
DF_SET_BLOCKS only effects the blocks that are effected when computing
the transfer functions and final solution.  The insn level information
is always kept up to date.

When a subset is given, the analysis behaves as if the function only
contains those blocks and any edges that occur directly between the
blocks in the set.  Care should be taken to call df_set_blocks right
before the call to analyze in order to eliminate the possibility that
optimizations that reorder blocks invalidate the bitvector.

DF_ANALYZE causes all of the defined problems to be (re)solved.  When
DF_ANALYZE is completes, the IN and OUT sets for each basic block
contain the computer information.  The DF_*_BB_INFO macros can be used
to access these bitvectors.  All deferred rescannings are down before
the transfer functions are recomputed.

DF_DUMP can then be called to dump the information produce to some
file.  This calls DF_DUMP_START, to print the information that is not
basic block specific, and then calls DF_DUMP_TOP and DF_DUMP_BOTTOM
for each block to print the basic specific information.  These parts
can all be called separately as part of a larger dump function.


DF_FINISH_PASS causes df_remove_problem to be called on all of the
optional problems.  It also causes any insns whose scanning has been
deferred to be rescanned as well as clears all of the changeable flags.
Setting the pass manager TODO_df_finish flag causes this function to
be run.  However, the pass manager will call df_finish_pass AFTER the
pass dumping has been done, so if you want to see the results of the
optional problems in the pass dumps, use the TODO flag rather than
calling the function yourself.

INCREMENTAL SCANNING

There are four ways of doing the incremental scanning:

1) Immediate rescanning - Calls to df_insn_rescan, df_notes_rescan,
   df_bb_delete, df_insn_change_bb have been added to most of
   the low level service functions that maintain the cfg and change
   rtl.  Calling and of these routines many cause some number of insns
   to be rescanned.

   For most modern rtl passes, this is certainly the easiest way to
   manage rescanning the insns.  This technique also has the advantage
   that the scanning information is always correct and can be relied
   upon even after changes have been made to the instructions.  This
   technique is contra indicated in several cases:

   a) If def-use chains OR use-def chains (but not both) are built,
      using this is SIMPLY WRONG.  The problem is that when a ref is
      deleted that is the target of an edge, there is not enough
      information to efficiently find the source of the edge and
      delete the edge.  This leaves a dangling reference that may
      cause problems.

   b) If def-use chains AND use-def chains are built, this may
      produce unexpected results.  The problem is that the incremental
      scanning of an insn does not know how to repair the chains that
      point into an insn when the insn changes.  So the incremental
      scanning just deletes the chains that enter and exit the insn
      being changed.  The dangling reference issue in (a) is not a
      problem here, but if the pass is depending on the chains being
      maintained after insns have been modified, this technique will
      not do the correct thing.

   c) If the pass modifies insns several times, this incremental
      updating may be expensive.

   d) If the pass modifies all of the insns, as does register
      allocation, it is simply better to rescan the entire function.

2) Deferred rescanning - Calls to df_insn_rescan, df_notes_rescan, and
   df_insn_delete do not immediately change the insn but instead make
   a note that the insn needs to be rescanned.  The next call to
   df_analyze, df_finish_pass, or df_process_deferred_rescans will
   cause all of the pending rescans to be processed.

   This is the technique of choice if either 1a, 1b, or 1c are issues
   in the pass.  In the case of 1a or 1b, a call to df_finish_pass
   (either manually or via TODO_df_finish) should be made before the
   next call to df_analyze or df_process_deferred_rescans.

   This mode is also used by a few passes that still rely on note_uses,
   note_stores and rtx iterators instead of using the DF data.  This
   can be said to fall under case 1c.

   To enable this mode, call df_set_flags (DF_DEFER_INSN_RESCAN).
   (This mode can be cleared by calling df_clear_flags
   (DF_DEFER_INSN_RESCAN) but this does not cause the deferred insns to
   be rescanned.

3) Total rescanning - In this mode the rescanning is disabled.
   Only when insns are deleted is the df information associated with
   it also deleted.  At the end of the pass, a call must be made to
   df_insn_rescan_all.  This method is used by the register allocator
   since it generally changes each insn multiple times (once for each ref)
   and does not need to make use of the updated scanning information.

4) Do it yourself - In this mechanism, the pass updates the insns
   itself using the low level df primitives.  Currently no pass does
   this, but it has the advantage that it is quite efficient given
   that the pass generally has exact knowledge of what it is changing.

DATA STRUCTURES

Scanning produces a `struct df_ref' data structure (ref) is allocated
for every register reference (def or use) and this records the insn
and bb the ref is found within.  The refs are linked together in
chains of uses and defs for each insn and for each register.  Each ref
also has a chain field that links all the use refs for a def or all
the def refs for a use.  This is used to create use-def or def-use
chains.

Different optimizations have different needs.  Ultimately, only
register allocation and schedulers should be using the bitmaps
produced for the live register and uninitialized register problems.
The rest of the backend should be upgraded to using and maintaining
the linked information such as def use or use def chains.


PHILOSOPHY:

While incremental bitmaps are not worthwhile to maintain, incremental
chains may be perfectly reasonable.  The fastest way to build chains
from scratch or after significant modifications is to build reaching
definitions (RD) and build the chains from this.

However, general algorithms for maintaining use-def or def-use chains
are not practical.  The amount of work to recompute the chain any
chain after an arbitrary change is large.  However, with a modest
amount of work it is generally possible to have the application that
uses the chains keep them up to date.  The high level knowledge of
what is really happening is essential to crafting efficient
incremental algorithms.

As for the bit vector problems, there is no interface to give a set of
blocks over with to resolve the iteration.  In general, restarting a
dataflow iteration is difficult and expensive.  Again, the best way to
keep the dataflow information up to data (if this is really what is
needed) it to formulate a problem specific solution.

There are fine grained calls for creating and deleting references from
instructions in df-scan.c.  However, these are not currently connected
to the engine that resolves the dataflow equations.


DATA STRUCTURES:

The basic object is a DF_REF (reference) and this may either be a
DEF (definition) or a USE of a register.

These are linked into a variety of lists; namely reg-def, reg-use,
insn-def, insn-use, def-use, and use-def lists.  For example, the
reg-def lists contain all the locations that define a given register
while the insn-use lists contain all the locations that use a
register.

Note that the reg-def and reg-use chains are generally short for
pseudos and long for the hard registers.

ACCESSING INSNS:

1) The df insn information is kept in an array of DF_INSN_INFO objects.
   The array is indexed by insn uid, and every DF_REF points to the
   DF_INSN_INFO object of the insn that contains the reference.

2) Each insn has three sets of refs, which are linked into one of three
   lists: The insn's defs list (accessed by the DF_INSN_INFO_DEFS,
   DF_INSN_DEFS, or DF_INSN_UID_DEFS macros), the insn's uses list
   (accessed by the DF_INSN_INFO_USES, DF_INSN_USES, or
   DF_INSN_UID_USES macros) or the insn's eq_uses list (accessed by the
   DF_INSN_INFO_EQ_USES, DF_INSN_EQ_USES or DF_INSN_UID_EQ_USES macros).
   The latter list are the list of references in REG_EQUAL or REG_EQUIV
   notes.  These macros produce a ref (or NULL), the rest of the list
   can be obtained by traversal of the NEXT_REF field (accessed by the
   DF_REF_NEXT_REF macro.)  There is no significance to the ordering of
   the uses or refs in an instruction.

3) Each insn has a logical uid field (LUID) which is stored in the
   DF_INSN_INFO object for the insn.  The LUID field is accessed by
   the DF_INSN_INFO_LUID, DF_INSN_LUID, and DF_INSN_UID_LUID macros.
   When properly set, the LUID is an integer that numbers each insn in
   the basic block, in order from the start of the block.
   The numbers are only correct after a call to df_analyze.  They will
   rot after insns are added deleted or moved round.

ACCESSING REFS:

There are 4 ways to obtain access to refs:

1) References are divided into two categories, REAL and ARTIFICIAL.

   REAL refs are associated with instructions.

   ARTIFICIAL refs are associated with basic blocks.  The heads of
   these lists can be accessed by calling df_get_artificial_defs or
   df_get_artificial_uses for the particular basic block.

   Artificial defs and uses occur both at the beginning and ends of blocks.

     For blocks that area at the destination of eh edges, the
     artificial uses and defs occur at the beginning.  The defs relate
     to the registers specified in EH_RETURN_DATA_REGNO and the uses
     relate to the registers specified in ED_USES.  Logically these
     defs and uses should really occur along the eh edge, but there is
     no convenient way to do this.  Artificial edges that occur at the
     beginning of the block have the DF_REF_AT_TOP flag set.

     Artificial uses occur at the end of all blocks.  These arise from
     the hard registers that are always live, such as the stack
     register and are put there to keep the code from forgetting about
     them.

     Artificial defs occur at the end of the entry block.  These arise
     from registers that are live at entry to the function.

2) There are three types of refs: defs, uses and eq_uses.  (Eq_uses are
   uses that appear inside a REG_EQUAL or REG_EQUIV note.)

   All of the eq_uses, uses and defs associated with each pseudo or
   hard register may be linked in a bidirectional chain.  These are
   called reg-use or reg_def chains.  If the changeable flag
   DF_EQ_NOTES is set when the chains are built, the eq_uses will be
   treated like uses.  If it is not set they are ignored.

   The first use, eq_use or def for a register can be obtained using
   the DF_REG_USE_CHAIN, DF_REG_EQ_USE_CHAIN or DF_REG_DEF_CHAIN
   macros.  Subsequent uses for the same regno can be obtained by
   following the next_reg field of the ref.  The number of elements in
   each of the chains can be found by using the DF_REG_USE_COUNT,
   DF_REG_EQ_USE_COUNT or DF_REG_DEF_COUNT macros.

   In previous versions of this code, these chains were ordered.  It
   has not been practical to continue this practice.

3) If def-use or use-def chains are built, these can be traversed to
   get to other refs.  If the flag DF_EQ_NOTES has been set, the chains
   include the eq_uses.  Otherwise these are ignored when building the
   chains.

4) An array of all of the uses (and an array of all of the defs) can
   be built.  These arrays are indexed by the value in the id
   structure.  These arrays are only lazily kept up to date, and that
   process can be expensive.  To have these arrays built, call
   df_reorganize_defs or df_reorganize_uses.  If the flag DF_EQ_NOTES
   has been set the array will contain the eq_uses.  Otherwise these
   are ignored when building the array and assigning the ids.  Note
   that the values in the id field of a ref may change across calls to
   df_analyze or df_reorganize_defs or df_reorganize_uses.

   If the only use of this array is to find all of the refs, it is
   better to traverse all of the registers and then traverse all of
   reg-use or reg-def chains.

NOTES:

Embedded addressing side-effects, such as POST_INC or PRE_INC, generate
both a use and a def.  These are both marked read/write to show that they
are dependent. For example, (set (reg 40) (mem (post_inc (reg 42))))
will generate a use of reg 42 followed by a def of reg 42 (both marked
read/write).  Similarly, (set (reg 40) (mem (pre_dec (reg 41))))
generates a use of reg 41 then a def of reg 41 (both marked read/write),
even though reg 41 is decremented before it is used for the memory
address in this second example.

A set to a REG inside a ZERO_EXTRACT, or a set to a non-paradoxical SUBREG
for which the number of word_mode units covered by the outer mode is
smaller than that covered by the inner mode, invokes a read-modify-write
operation.  We generate both a use and a def and again mark them
read/write.

Paradoxical subreg writes do not leave a trace of the old content, so they
are write-only operations.
