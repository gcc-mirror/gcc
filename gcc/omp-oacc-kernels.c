/* This is a preprocessing pass to be run immediately before lower_omp.  It
   will convert OpenACC "kernels" regions into sequences of "parallel"
   regions.
   For now, the translation is as follows:
   - The entire kernels region is turned into a data region with clauses
     taken from the kernels region.  New "create" clauses are added for all
     variables declared at the top level in the kernels region.
   - Any loop annotated with an OpenACC loop directive is wrapped in a new
     parallel region.  Gang/worker/vector annotations are copied from the
     original kernels region if present.
     * Loops without an explicit "independent" or "seq" annotation get an
       "auto" annotation; other annotations are preserved on the loop or
       moved to the new surrounding parallel region.  Which annotations are
       moved is determined by the constraints in the OpenACC spec; for
       example, loops in the kernels region may have a gang clause, but
       such annotations must now be moved to the new parallel region.
   - Any sequences of other code (non-loops, non-OpenACC loops) are wrapped
     in new "gang-single" parallel regions: Worker/vector annotations are
     copied from the original kernels region if present, but num_gangs is
     explicitly set to 1.  */

   A "top-level" OMP_FOR statement is one that is possibly accompanied by
   small snippets of setup code.  Specifically, this function accepts an
   OMP_FOR possibly wrapped in a singleton bind and a singleton try
   statement to allow for a local loop variable, but not an OMP_FOR
   statement nested in any other constructs.  Alternatively, it accepts a

/* Auxiliary analysis of the body of a kernels region, to determine for each
   OpenACC loop whether it is control-dependent (i.e., not necessarily
   executed every time the kernels region is entered) or not.
   We say that a loop is control-dependent if there is some cond, switch, or
   goto statement that jumps over it, forwards or backwards.  For example,
   if the loop is controlled by an if statement, then a jump to the true
   block, the false block, or from one of those blocks to the control flow
   join point will necessarily jump over the loop.
   This analysis implements an ad-hoc union-find data structure classifying
   statements into "control-flow regions" as follows: Most statements are in
   the same region as their predecessor, except that each OpenACC loop is in
   a region of its own, and each OpenACC loop's successor starts a new
   region.  We then unite the regions of any statements linked by jumps,
   placing any cond, switch, or goto statement in the same region as its
   target label(s).
   In the end, control dependence of OpenACC loops can be determined by
   comparing their immediate predecessor and successor statements' regions.
   A jump crosses the loop if and only if the predecessor and successor are
   in the same region.  (If there is no predecessor or successor, the loop
   is executed unconditionally.)
   The methods in this class identify statements by their index in the
   kernels region's body.  */
