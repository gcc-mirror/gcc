/* Rewriting a function into SSA form can create a huge number of PHIs
   many of which may be thrown away shortly after their creation if jumps
   were threaded through PHI nodes.

   While our garbage collection mechanisms will handle this situation, it
   is extremely wasteful to create nodes and throw them away, especially
   when the nodes can be reused.

   For PR 8361, we can significantly reduce the number of nodes allocated
   and thus the total amount of memory allocated by managing PHIs a
   little.  This additionally helps reduce the amount of work done by the
   garbage collector.  Similar results have been seen on a wider variety
   of tests (such as the compiler itself).

   PHI nodes have different sizes, so we can't have a single list of all
   the PHI nodes as it would be too expensive to walk down that list to
   find a PHI of a suitable size.

   Instead we have an array of lists of free PHI nodes.  The array is
   indexed by the number of PHI alternatives that PHI node can hold.
   Except for the last array member, which holds all remaining PHI
   nodes.

   So to find a free PHI node, we compute its index into the free PHI
   node array and see if there are any elements with an exact match.
   If so, then we are done.  Otherwise, we test the next larger size
   up and continue until we are in the last array element.

   We do not actually walk members of the last array element.  While it
   might allow us to pick up a few reusable PHI nodes, it could potentially
   be very expensive if the program has released a bunch of large PHI nodes,
   but keeps asking for even larger PHI nodes.  Experiments have shown that
   walking the elements of the last array entry would result in finding less
   than .1% additional reusable PHI nodes.

   Note that we can never have less than two PHI argument slots.  Thus,
   the -2 on all the calculations below.  */
