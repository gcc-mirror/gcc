/* Rewrites the program into a loop closed ssa form -- i.e. inserts extra
   phi nodes to ensure that no variable is used outside the loop it is
   defined in.

   This strengthening of the basic ssa form has several advantages:

   1) Updating it during unrolling/peeling/versioning is trivial, since
      we do not need to care about the uses outside of the loop.
      The same applies to virtual operands which are also rewritten into
      loop closed SSA form.  Note that virtual operands are always live
      until function exit.
   2) The behavior of all uses of an induction variable is the same.
      Without this, you need to distinguish the case when the variable
      is used outside of the loop it is defined in, for example

      for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
	{
	  for (j = 0; j < 100; j++)
	    {
	      k = i + j;
	      use1 (k);
	    }
	  use2 (k);
	}

      Looking from the outer loop with the normal SSA form, the first use of k
      is not well-behaved, while the second one is an induction variable with
      base 99 and step 1.

      If CHANGED_BBS is not NULL, we look for uses outside loops only in
      the basic blocks in this set.
