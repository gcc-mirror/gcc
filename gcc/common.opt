;
; 1: The version of the ABI first used in G++ 3.2.  No longer selectable.
;
; 2: The version of the ABI first used in G++ 3.4, and the default

;
; 3: The version of the ABI that fixes the missing underscore

;
; 4: The version of the ABI that introduces unambiguous mangling of
;    vector types.  First selectable in G++ 4.5.
;
; 5: The version of the ABI that ignores attribute const/noreturn
;    in function pointer mangling, and corrects mangling of decltype and
;    function parameters used in other parameters and the return type.
;    First selectable in G++ 4.6.
;
; 6: The version of the ABI that doesn't promote scoped enums to int and
;    changes the mangling of template argument packs, const/static_cast,
;    prefix ++ and --, and a class scope function used as a template
;    argument.
;    First selectable in G++ 4.7.
;
; 7: The version of the ABI that treats nullptr_t as a builtin type and
;    corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument scope.
;    First selectable in G++ 4.8.
;
; 8: The version of the ABI that corrects the substitution behavior of

;    First selectable in G++ 4.9 and default in G++ 5.
;
; 9: The version of the ABI that corrects the alignment of nullptr_t.

;     identity, such as ia32 calling convention attributes (stdcall, etc.)
;     Default in G++ 6 (set in c_common_post_options).
;
; 11: The version of the ABI that corrects mangling of sizeof... expressions
;     and introduces new inheriting constructor handling.
;     Default in G++ 7.
;
; 12: Corrects the calling convention for classes with only deleted copy/move
;     constructors and changes passing/returning of empty records.
;     Default in G++ 8.1.
;
; 13: Fixes the accidental change in 12 to the calling convention for classes
