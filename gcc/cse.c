/* The basic idea of common subexpression elimination is to go
   through the code, keeping a record of expressions that would
   have the same value at the current scan point, and replacing
   expressions encountered with the cheapest equivalent expression.

   It is too complicated to keep track of the different possibilities
   when control paths merge; so, at each label, we forget all that is
   known and start fresh.  This can be described as processing each
   basic block separately.  Note, however, that these are not quite
   the same as the basic blocks found by a later pass and used for
   data flow analysis and register packing.  We do not need to start fresh
   after a conditional jump instruction if there is no label there.

   We use two data structures to record the equivalent expressions:
   a hash table for most expressions, and several vectors together
   with "quantity numbers" to record equivalent (pseudo) registers.

   The use of the special data structure for registers is desirable
   because it is faster.  It is possible because registers references
   contain a fairly small number, the register number, taken from
   a contiguously allocated series, and two register references are
   identical if they have the same number.  General expressions
   do not have any such thing, so the only way to retrieve the
   information recorded on an expression other than a register
   is to keep it in a hash table.

Registers and "quantity numbers":
   
   At the start of each basic block, all of the (hardware and pseudo)
   registers used in the function are given distinct quantity
   numbers to indicate their contents.  During scan, when the code
   copies one register into another, we copy the quantity number.
   When a register is loaded in any other way, we allocate a new
   quantity number to describe the value generated by this operation.
   `reg_qty' records what quantity a register is currently thought
   of as containing.

   All real quantity numbers are greater than or equal to `max_reg'.
   If register N has not been assigned a quantity, reg_qty[N] will equal N.

   Quantity numbers below `max_reg' do not exist and none of the `qty_...'
   variables should be referenced with an index below `max_reg'.

   We also maintain a bidirectional chain of registers for each
   quantity number.  `qty_first_reg', `qty_last_reg',
   `reg_next_eqv' and `reg_prev_eqv' hold these chains.

   The first register in a chain is the one whose lifespan is least local.
   Among equals, it is the one that was seen first.
   We replace any equivalent register with that one.

   If two registers have the same quantity number, it must be true that
   REG expressions with `qty_mode' must be in the hash table for both
   registers and must be in the same class.

   The converse is not true.  Since hard registers may be referenced in
   any mode, two REG expressions might be equivalent in the hash table
   but not have the same quantity number if the quantity number of one
   of the registers is not the same mode as those expressions.
   
Constants and quantity numbers

   When a quantity has a known constant value, that value is stored
   in the appropriate element of qty_const.  This is in addition to
   putting the constant in the hash table as is usual for non-regs.

   Whether a reg or a constant is preferred is determined by the configuration
   macro CONST_COSTS and will often depend on the constant value.  In any
   event, expressions containing constants can be simplified, by fold_rtx.

   When a quantity has a known nearly constant value (such as an address
   of a stack slot), that value is stored in the appropriate element
   of qty_const.

   Integer constants don't have a machine mode.  However, cse
   determines the intended machine mode from the destination
   of the instruction that moves the constant.  The machine mode
   is recorded in the hash table along with the actual RTL
   constant expression so that different modes are kept separate.

Other expressions:

   To record known equivalences among expressions in general
   we use a hash table called `table'.  It has a fixed number of buckets
   that contain chains of `struct table_elt' elements for expressions.
   These chains connect the elements whose expressions have the same
   hash codes.

   Other chains through the same elements connect the elements which
   currently have equivalent values.

   Register references in an expression are canonicalized before hashing
   the expression.  This is done using `reg_qty' and `qty_first_reg'.
   The hash code of a register reference is computed using the quantity
   number, not the register number.

   When the value of an expression changes, it is necessary to remove from the
   hash table not just that expression but all expressions whose values
   could be different as a result.

     1. If the value changing is in memory, except in special cases
     ANYTHING referring to memory could be changed.  That is because
     nobody knows where a pointer does not point.
     The function `invalidate_memory' removes what is necessary.

     The special cases are when the address is constant or is
     a constant plus a fixed register such as the frame pointer
     or a static chain pointer.  When such addresses are stored in,
     we can tell exactly which other such addresses must be invalidated
     due to overlap.  `invalidate' does this.
     All expressions that refer to non-constant
     memory addresses are also invalidated.  `invalidate_memory' does this.

     2. If the value changing is a register, all expressions
     containing references to that register, and only those,
     must be removed.

   Because searching the entire hash table for expressions that contain
   a register is very slow, we try to figure out when it isn't necessary.
   Precisely, this is necessary only when expressions have been
   entered in the hash table using this register, and then the value has
   changed, and then another expression wants to be added to refer to
   the register's new value.  This sequence of circumstances is rare
   within any one basic block.

   The vectors `reg_tick' and `reg_in_table' are used to detect this case.
   reg_tick[i] is incremented whenever a value is stored in register i.
   reg_in_table[i] holds -1 if no references to register i have been
   entered in the table; otherwise, it contains the value reg_tick[i] had
   when the references were entered.  If we want to enter a reference
   and reg_in_table[i] != reg_tick[i], we must scan and remove old references.
   Until we want to enter a new entry, the mere fact that the two vectors
   don't match makes the entries be ignored if anyone tries to match them.

   Registers themselves are entered in the hash table as well as in
   the equivalent-register chains.  However, the vectors `reg_tick'
   and `reg_in_table' do not apply to expressions which are simple
   register references.  These expressions are removed from the table
   immediately when they become invalid, and this can be done even if
   we do not immediately search for all the expressions that refer to
   the register.

   A CLOBBER rtx in an instruction invalidates its operand for further
   reuse.  A CLOBBER or SET rtx whose operand is a MEM:BLK
   invalidates everything that resides in memory.

Related expressions:

   Constant expressions that differ only by an additive integer
   are called related.  When a constant expression is put in
   the table, the related expression with no constant term
   is also entered.  These are made to point at each other
   so that it is possible to find out if there exists any
   register equivalent to an expression related to a given expression.  */
