 *      (number of wait states). Software information includes: Compiler
 *      (and runtime library) manufacturer and version, compilation
 *      switches, OS version. The Operating System version may give an
 *      indication about the compiler; Dhrystone itself performs no OS
 *      calls in the measurement loop.
 *
 *      The complete output generated by the program should be mailed
 *      such that at least some checks for correctness can be made.

 *************************************************************************
 *
 *  History:    This version C/2.1 has been made for two reasons:
 *
 *              1) There is an obvious need for a common C version of
 *              Dhrystone, since C is at present the most popular system
 *              programming language for the class of processors
 *              (microcomputers, minicomputers) where Dhrystone is used
 *              most. There should be, as far as possible, only one C
 *              version of Dhrystone such that results can be compared
 *              without restrictions. In the past, the C versions
 *              distributed by Rick Richardson (Version 1.1) and by
 *              Reinhold Weicker had small (though not significant)
 *              differences.
 *
 *              2) As far as it is possible without changes to the
 *              Dhrystone statistics, optimizing compilers should be
 *              prevented from removing significant statements.
 *
 *              This C version has been developed in cooperation with
 *              Rick Richardson (Tinton Falls, NJ), it incorporates many
 *              ideas from the "Version 1.1" distributed previously by
 *              him over the UNIX network Usenet.
 *              I also thank Chaim Benedelac (National Semiconductor),
 *              David Ditzel (SUN), Earl Killian and John Mashey (MIPS),
 *              Alan Smith and Rafael Saavedra-Barrera (UC at Berkeley)
 *              for their help with comments on earlier versions of the
 *              benchmark.
 *
 *  Changes:    In the initialization part, this version follows mostly
 *              Rick Richardson's version distributed via Usenet, not the
 *              version distributed earlier via floppy disk by Reinhold
 *              Weicker. As a concession to older compilers, names have
 *              been made unique within the first 8 characters. Inside the
 *              measurement loop, this version follows the version
 *              previously distributed by Reinhold Weicker.
 *
 *              At several places in the benchmark, code has been added,
 *              but within the measurement loop only in branches that
 *              are not executed. The intention is that optimizing
 *              compilers should be prevented from moving code out of the
 *              measurement loop, or from removing code altogether. Since
 *              the statements that are executed within the measurement
 *              loop have NOT been changed, the numbers defining the
 *              "Dhrystone distribution" (distribution of statements,
 *              operand types and locality) still hold. Except for
 *              sophisticated optimizing compilers, execution times for
 *              this version should be the same as for previous versions.
 *
 *              Since it has proven difficult to subtract the time for the
 *              measurement loop overhead in a correct way, the loop check
 *              has been made a part of the benchmark. This does have
 *              an impact - though a very minor one - on the distribution
 *              statistics which have been updated for this version.
 *
 *              All changes within the measurement loop are described
 *              and discussed in the companion paper "Rationale for
 *              Dhrystone version 2".
 *
 *              Because of the self-imposed limitation that the order and
 *              distribution of the executed statements should not be
 *              changed, there are still cases where optimizing compilers
 *              may not generate code for some statements. To a certain
 *              degree, this is unavoidable for small synthetic
 *              benchmarks. Users of the benchmark are advised to check
 *              code listings whether code is generated for all statements
 *              of Dhrystone.
 *
 *              Version 2.1 is identical to version 2.0 distributed via
 *              the UNIX network Usenet in March 1988 except that it
 *              corrects some minor deficiencies that were found by users
 *              of version 2.0. The only change within the measurement
 *              loop is that a non-executed "else" part was added to the
 *              "if" statement in Func_3, and a non-executed "else" part
 *              removed from Proc_3.
 *
 *************************************************************************
 *
 * Defines:     The following "Defines" are possible:
 *              -DROPT         (default: Not defined)
 *                      As an approximation to what an average C
 *                      programmer might do, the "register" storage class
 *                      is applied (if enabled by -DROPT)
 *                      - for local variables, if they are used
 *                        (dynamically) five or more times
 *                      - for parameters if they are used (dynamically)
 *                        six or more times
 *                      Note that an optimal "register" strategy is
 *                      compiler-dependent, and that "register"
 *                      declarations do not necessarily lead to faster
 *                      execution.
 *              -DNOSTRUCTASSIGN        (default: Not defined)
 *                      Define if the C compiler does not support
 *                      assignment of structures.
 *              -DNOENUMS               (default: Not defined)
 *                      Define if the C compiler does not support
 *                      enumeration types.
 *
 *************************************************************************
 *
 *  Compilation model and measurement (IMPORTANT):
 *
 *  This C version of Dhrystone consists of three files:
 *  - dhry.h (this file, containing global definitions and comments)
 *  - dhry_1.c (containing the code corresponding to Ada package Pack_1)
 *  - dhry_2.c (containing the code corresponding to Ada package Pack_2)
 *
 *  The following "ground rules" apply for measurements:
 *  - Separate compilation
 *  - No procedure merging
 *  - Otherwise, compiler optimizations are allowed but should be
 *    indicated
 *  - Default results are those without register declarations
 *  See the companion paper "Rationale for Dhrystone Version 2" for a more
 *  detailed discussion of these ground rules.
 *
 *  For 16-Bit processors (e.g. 80186, 80286), times for all compilation
 *  models ("small", "medium", "large" etc.) should be given if possible,
 *  together with a definition of these models for the compiler system
 *  used.
 *

 *
 *  Dhrystone (C version) statistics:
 *
 *  [Comment from the first distribution, updated for version 2.
 *   Note that because of language differences, the numbers are slightly
 *   different from the Ada version.]
 *
 *  The following program contains statements of a high level programming
 *  language (here: C) in a distribution considered representative:
 *
 *    assignments                  52 (51.0 %)
 *    control statements           33 (32.4 %)
 *    procedure, function calls    17 (16.7 %)
 *
 *  103 statements are dynamically executed. The program is balanced with
 *  respect to the three aspects:
 *
 *    - statement type
 *    - operand type
 *    - operand locality
 *         operand global, local, parameter, or constant.
 *
 *  The combination of these three aspects is balanced only approximately.

 *
 *  When there is an access path leading to the final operand (e.g. a
 *  record component), only the final data type on the access path is
 *  counted.
 *
 *
 *  4. Operand Locality:

 *     global variable              22         9.1 %
 *     parameter                    45        18.6 %
 *        value                        23         9.5 %
 *        reference                    22         9.1 %
 *     function result               6         2.5 %
 *     constant                     55        22.7 %
 *                                 ---       -------
 *                                 242       100.0 %
 *
 *
 *  The program does not compute anything meaningful, but it is
 *  syntactically and semantically correct. All variables have a value
 *  assigned to them before they are used as a source operand.
 *
 *  There has been no explicit effort to account for the effects of a
 *  cache, or to balance the use of long or short displacements for code
 *  or data.
