This is a collection of tests for the C and C++ frontends of EGCS. For
further information please check README.gcc and README.g++, though the
latter may not be up-to-date any more.

The driver that runs this testsuite is called DejaGnu and you will
need a current DejaGnu snapshot, which is available from
ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/infrastructure, for example.

Most of these tests were originally developed and/or collected by
Cygnus Support, but these days many are being added by the EGCS
developers.

These tests are included "as is". If any of them fails, do not report
a bug.  Bug reports for DejaGnu can go to bug-dejagnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.
Discussion and comments about this testsuite should be sent to
egcs@cygnus.com; additions and changes to should go to sent to
egcs-patches@cygnus.com.

The entire testsuite is invoked by `make check` at the top level of
the EGCS tree. `make check-g++` runs the C++ testsuite only.
