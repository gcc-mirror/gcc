Notes for testsuite/gcc.dg.

1) There should be only one driver, dg.exp.

2) Try to organize the tests by topic using file name prefixes.

   Eg: All bitfield tests are named "bf-*.c".

   This lets the person running the tests choose particular sets of tests to
   run easily (using wildcards).

   Eg: make check RUNTESTFLAGS='dg.exp=bf-*.c'

3) Remember DOS file name restrictions (8.3).  Sigh.

4) Send bugs, comments, etc. to dje@cygnus.com.
