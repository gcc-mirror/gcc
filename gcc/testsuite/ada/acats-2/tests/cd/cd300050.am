--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that Address clauses are supported for imported subprograms.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test imports a simple C function and specifies it's location.
--
--      The implementation may choose to implement
--      Impdef.CD30005_1_Foreign_Address so as to dynamically call a C
--      function that returns the appropriate address for the external
--      function identified by Impdef.CD30005_1_External_Name.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--         CD300050.AM
--         CD300051.C  -- the C function:  (included below for reference)
--
-- SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
--      The file CD300051.C must be compiled with a C compiler.
--      Implementation dialects of C may require alteration of the C program
--      syntax.  The program is included here for reference:
--
--            int _cd30005_1( int Value )
--            {
--               /* int Value */
--
--               return Value + 1;
--            }
--
--      Implementations may require special linkage commands to include the
--      C code.
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--    This test is not applicable to implementations not providing an interface
--    to C language units.  OTHERWISE:
--
--      All implementations must attempt to compile this test.
--
--      For implementations validating against Systems Programming Annex (C):
--        this test must execute and report PASSED.
--
--      For implementations not validating against Annex C:
--        this test may report compile time errors at one or more points
--        indicated by "-- ANX-C RQMT", in which case it may be graded as
--        inapplicable. Otherwise, the test must execute and report PASSED.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      22 JUL 95   SAIC   Initial version
--      30 APR 96   SAIC   Added commentary for 2.1
--      09 MAY 96   SAIC   Changed reporting for 2.1
--      04 NOV 96   SAIC   Added use type System.Address
--      16 FEB 98   EDS    Modified documentation.
--      29 JUN 98   EDS    Modified main program name.
--      03 JUN 24   RLB    Corrected C program to have a proper prototype.
