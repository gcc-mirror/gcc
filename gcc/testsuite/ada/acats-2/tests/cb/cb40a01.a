--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that a user defined exception is correctly propagated out of
--      a public child package.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Declare a public child package containing a procedure used to 
--      analyze the alphanumeric content of a particular text string.
--      The procedure contains a processing loop that continues until the
--      range of the text string is exceeded, at which time a user defined
--      exception is raised.  This exception propagates out of the procedure
--      through the parent package, to the main test program.
--
--      Exception Type Raised:
--        * User Defined
--          Predefined  
--
--      Hierarchical Structure Employed For This Test:  
--        * Parent Package
--        * Public Child Package
--          Private Child Package
--          Public Child Subprogram
--          Private Child Subprogram
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test depends on the following foundation code:
--         FB40A00.A
