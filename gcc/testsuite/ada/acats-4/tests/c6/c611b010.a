--     rights are the same as those granted by the U.S. Government for older

--                                     Notice
--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      For X'Old given in the postcondition for a subprogram S, check that
--      X'Old has the same tag as X when X is a parameter P of S, even if the
--      tag of X is different than the nominal subtype of P (Part 1: Post).
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      We declare an event counter type and an extension thereof. We include
--      function calls that are bound based on the type of the prefix, and
--      check which are called.
--
--      To check the objective, we directly check the tag. It would have been
--      more usage-oriented to test dispatching instead, but that would have
--      added more complication to the test.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> C611B010.A
--         C611B011.A
--         C611B012.AM
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      21 Mar 16   JAC     Initial pre-release version.
--      24 Mar 16   RLB     Renamed so all test parts have same first 7
--                          characters.
