-- OBJECTIVE:
--     See C611A020.A.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     See C611A020.A.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--     This test consists of the following files:
--        C611A020.A
--     -> C611A021.A
--        C611A022.AM
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     21 Mar 16   JAC    Initial pre-release version.
--     24 Mar 16   RLB    Renamed so all test parts have the same name.
--     30 Mar 16   RLB    Split all of the specific type objectives into
--                        a single test.
--     31 Mar 16   RLB    Removed duplicative suffixes.
