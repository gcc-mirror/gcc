--   CHECK THAT AN INSTANTIATED PACKAGE HAS THE PROPERTIES REQUIRED
--   OF A PACKAGE.

--   CHECK THAT IF THE PARENT TYPE IN A DERIVED TYPE DEFINITION IS
--   A GENERIC FORMAL TYPE, THE OPERATIONS DECLARED FOR THE DERIVED
--   TYPE IN THE TEMPLATE ARE DETERMINED BY THE DECLARATION OF THE
--   FORMAL TYPE.  THE OPERATIONS DECLARED FOR DERIVED TYPE IN THE
--   INSTANCE ARE DETERMINED BY THE ACTUAL TYPE DENOTED BY THE FORMAL
--   PARAMETER.  SEE AI-00398.

-- HISTORY:
--   DAS  8 OCT 90   INITIAL VERSION.
--   JRL 02/19/93  ADDED USE CLAUSES FOR INSTANCES TO ENSURE DIRECT
--                 OPERATOR VISIBILITY. CHANGED NT4'LAST TO P4.NT4'LAST

--                 CORRECTED ABE ERRORS IN EXAMPLE_2 AND EXAMPLE_3.
--                 CHANGED R3."+" FROM MULTIPLICATION TO SUBTRACTION TO
