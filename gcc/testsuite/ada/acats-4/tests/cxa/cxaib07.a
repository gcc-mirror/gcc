--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--    Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--    with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--    assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--    to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--    ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--
--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that Ada.Containers.Hashed_Maps is preelaborated.
--
--      Check that type Map from an instance of Ada.Containers.Hashed_Maps
--      has Preeelaborable_Initialization, regardless of whether the element
--      type has Preelaborable_Initialization.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test is designed to imagine an active mapping program which
--      keeps its data in instances of Ada.Containers.Hashed_Maps. Static
--      items are kept in one map and movable items are kept in a different
--      map with additional data.
--
--      The data are declared in a preelaborated package to improve startup
--      times.
--
--      Note that for a (unbounded) Map, the container type Map has
--      preelaborable initialization regardless of whether the element type
--      does. (Elements are supposed to be created as needed, and creation
--      is not needed when a container is initialized.)
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    23 Dec 2020   RLB   Created test.
