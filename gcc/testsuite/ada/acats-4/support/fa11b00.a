-- This foundation simulates code that might be obtained as an already
-- implemented set of objects and services, perhaps from a source code
-- vendor.  It represents processing of widgets in a window system.  
-- These widgets all have the same characteristics, but they are application 
-- specific, so we do not allow assignment of an App_1_Widget to App_2_Widget.
