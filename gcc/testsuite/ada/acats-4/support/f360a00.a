-- FOUNDATION DESCRIPTION:
--     This foundation provides a number of arrays of discrete with default
--     component values. We assume that the default values are necessary to
--     ensure an expected initial condition.
--
--     We use default values that are non-zero to minimize the chance that
--     we'll accidentally properly initialize objects (some targets initialize
--     new memory to zero). For the Integer and Modular types, we use defaults
--     that are similar to the values used when pragma Normalize_Scalars is
--     in effect.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     30 Sep 2020   RLB   Created foundation.
