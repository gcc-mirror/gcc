--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that the body of a protected function declared as an object of a
--      given type can have internal calls to other protected functions and
--      that a protected procedure in such an object can have internal calls
--      to protected procedures and to  protected functions. 
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      Simulate a meter at a freeway on-ramp which, when real-time sensors
--      determine that the freeway is becoming saturated, triggers stop lights
--      which control the access of vehicles to prevent further saturation. 
--      Each on-ramp is represented by a protected object of the type Ramp. 
--      The routines to sample and alter the states of the various sensors, to
--      queue the vehicles on the meter and to release them are all part of
--      the  protected object and can be shared by various tasks. Apart from
--      the function/procedure tests this example has a mix of other tasking
--      features.  In this test two objects representing two adjacent ramps
--      are created from the same type.  The same "traffic" is simulated for
--      each ramp.  The results should be identical.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      13 Nov 95   SAIC    Replaced shared global variable Pulse_Stop
--                          with a protected object.
--                          ACVC 2.0.1
