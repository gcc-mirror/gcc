/* Expression definitions and descriptions for all targets are in this file.
   Some will not be used for some targets.

   The fields in the cpp macro call "DEF_RTL_EXPR()"
   are used to create declarations in the C source of the compiler.

   The fields are:

   1.  The internal name of the rtx used in the C source.
   It is a tag in the enumeration "enum rtx_code" defined in "rtl.h".
   By convention these are in UPPER_CASE.

   2.  The name of the rtx in the external ASCII format read by
   read_rtx(), and printed by print_rtx().
   These names are stored in rtx_name[].
   By convention these are the internal (field 1) names in lower_case.

   3.  The print format, and type of each rtx->fld[] (field) in this rtx.
   These formats are stored in rtx_format[].
   The meaning of the formats is documented in front of this array in rtl.c
   
   4.  The class of the rtx.  These are stored in rtx_class and are accessed
   via the GET_RTX_CLASS macro.  They are defined as follows:

     "o" an rtx code that can be used to represent an object (e.g, REG, MEM)
     "<" an rtx code for a comparison (e.g, EQ, NE, LT)
     "1" an rtx code for a unary arithmetic expression (e.g, NEG, NOT)
     "c" an rtx code for a commutative binary operation (e.g,, PLUS, MULT)
     "3" an rtx code for a non-bitfield three input operation (IF_THEN_ELSE)
     "2" an rtx code for a non-commutative binary operation (e.g., MINUS, DIV)
     "b" an rtx code for a bit-field operation (ZERO_EXTRACT, SIGN_EXTRACT)
     "i" an rtx code for a machine insn (INSN, JUMP_INSN, CALL_INSN)
     "m" an rtx code for something that matches in insns (e.g, MATCH_DUP)
     "g" an rtx code for grouping insns together (e.g, GROUP_PARALLEL)
     "x" everything else

   as a predicate; if matched, store the structure that was matched
   in the operand table at index specified by the first arg (the integer).
   If the second arg is the null string, the structure is just stored.

   A third string argument indicates to the register allocator restrictions
   on where the operand can be allocated.

   If the target needs no restriction on any instruction this field should
   be the null string.

   The string is prepended by:
   '=' to indicate the operand is only written to.
   '+' to indicate the operand is both read and written to.

   Each character in the string represents an allocable class for an operand.
   'g' indicates the operand can be any valid class.
   'i' indicates the operand can be immediate (in the instruction) data.
   'r' indicates the operand can be in a register.
   'm' indicates the operand can be in memory.
   'o' a subset of the 'm' class.  Those memory addressing modes that
       can be offset at compile time (have a constant added to them).

   Other characters indicate target dependent operand classes and
   are described in each target's machine description.

   For instructions with more than one operand, sets of classes can be
   separated by a comma to indicate the appropriate multi-operand constraints.
