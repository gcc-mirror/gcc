# LTO is a special front end.  From a user's perspective it is not
# really a language, but a middle end feature.  However, the GIMPLE
# reading module is implemented as a front end, so enabling LTO means
# enabling this "language". To enable LTO functionality, use
# --enable-lto when configuring the compiler.

# Add LTO to boot language if it is enabled.
