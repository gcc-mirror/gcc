TYPE
   SEMAPHORE ;         (* defines Dijkstra's semaphores *)
   DESCRIPTOR ;        (* handle onto a process         *)


(*
   InitProcess - initializes a process which is held in the suspended
                 state. When the process is resumed it will start executing
                 procedure, p. The process has a maximum stack size of,
                 StackSize, bytes and its textual name is, Name.
                 The StackSize should be at least 5000 bytes.
*)

PROCEDURE InitProcess (p: PROC; StackSize: CARDINAL;
                       Name: ARRAY OF CHAR) : DESCRIPTOR ;


(*
   KillProcess - kills the current process. Notice that if InitProcess
                 is called again, it might reuse the DESCRIPTOR of the
                 killed process. It is the responsibility of the caller
                 to ensure all other processes understand this process
                 is different.
*)

PROCEDURE KillProcess ;


(*
   Resume - resumes a suspended process. If all is successful then the process, p,
            is returned. If it fails then NIL is returned.
*)

PROCEDURE Resume (d: DESCRIPTOR) : DESCRIPTOR ;


(*
   Suspend - suspend the calling process.
             The process can only continue running if another process
             Resumes it.
*)

PROCEDURE Suspend ;


(*
   InitSemaphore - creates a semaphore whose initial value is, v, and
                   whose name is, Name.
*)

PROCEDURE InitSemaphore (v: CARDINAL; Name: ARRAY OF CHAR) : SEMAPHORE ;


(*
   Wait - performs dijkstra's P operation on a semaphore.
          A process which calls this procedure will
          wait until the value of the semaphore is > 0
          and then it will decrement this value.
*)

PROCEDURE Wait (s: SEMAPHORE) ;


(*
   Signal - performs dijkstra's V operation on a semaphore.
            A process which calls the procedure will increment
            the semaphores value.
*)

PROCEDURE Signal (s: SEMAPHORE) ;


(*
   WaitForIO - waits for an interrupt to occur on vector, VectorNo.
*)

PROCEDURE WaitForIO (VectorNo: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   Ps - displays a process list together with process status.
*)

PROCEDURE Ps ;


(*
   GetCurrentProcess - returns the descriptor of the current running
                       process.
*)

PROCEDURE GetCurrentProcess () : DESCRIPTOR ;


(*
   RotateRunQueue - rotates the process run queue.
                    It does not call the scheduler.
*)

PROCEDURE RotateRunQueue ;


(*
   ProcessName - displays the name of process, d, through
                 DebugString.
*)

PROCEDURE ProcessName (d: DESCRIPTOR) ;


(*
   DebugProcess - gdb debug handle to enable users to debug deadlocked
                  semaphore processes.
*)

PROCEDURE DebugProcess (d: DESCRIPTOR) ;


END Executive.
