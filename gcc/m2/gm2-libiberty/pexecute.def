DEFINITION MODULE FOR "C" pexecute ;

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADDRESS ;

EXPORT UNQUALIFIED pexecute ;

(*
   PROGRAM and ARGV are the arguments to execv/execvp.

   THIS_PNAME is name of the calling program (i.e. argv[0]).

   TEMP_BASE is the path name, sans suffix, of a temporary file to use
   if needed.  This is currently only needed for MSDOS ports that don't use
   GO32 (do any still exist?).  Ports that don't need it can pass NULL.

   (FLAGS & PEXECUTE_SEARCH) is non-zero if $PATH should be searched
   (??? It's not clear that GCC passes this flag correctly).
   (FLAGS & PEXECUTE_FIRST) is nonzero for the first process in chain.
   (FLAGS & PEXECUTE_FIRST) is nonzero for the last process in chain.
   FIRST_LAST could be simplified to only mark the last of a chain of processes
   but that requires the caller to always mark the last one (and not give up
   early if some error occurs).  It's more robust to require the caller to
   mark both ends of the chain.

   The result is the pid on systems like Unix where we fork/exec and on systems
   like WIN32 and OS2 where we use spawn.  It is up to the caller to wait for
   the child.

   The result is the WEXITSTATUS on systems like MSDOS where we spawn and wait
   for the child here.

   Upon failure, ERRMSG_FMT and ERRMSG_ARG are set to the text of the error
   message with an optional argument (if not needed, ERRMSG_ARG is set to
   NULL), and -1 is returned.  `errno' is available to the caller to use.

   pwait: cover function for wait.

   PID is the process id of the task to wait for.
   STATUS is the `status' argument to wait.
   FLAGS is currently unused (allows future enhancement without breaking
   upward compatibility).  Pass 0 for now.

   The result is the pid of the child reaped,
   or -1 for failure (errno says why).

   On systems that don't support waiting for a particular child, PID is
   ignored.  On systems like MSDOS that don't really multitask pwait
   is just a mechanism to provide a consistent interface for the caller.

   pfinish: finish generation of script

   pfinish is necessary for systems like MPW where a script is generated that
   runs the requested programs.
