(*
   PushCase - create a case entity and push it to an internal stack.
              Return the case id.
*)

PROCEDURE PushCase (r: CARDINAL; v: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   PopCase - pop the top element of the case entity from the internal
             stack.
*)

PROCEDURE PopCase ;


(*
   ElseCase - indicates that this case varient does have an else clause.

PROCEDURE ElseCase (f: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   BeginCaseList - create a new label list.
*)

PROCEDURE BeginCaseList (v: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   EndCaseList - terminate the current label list.

(*
   AddRange - add a range to the current label list.
*)

(*
   CaseBoundsResolved - returns TRUE if all constants in the case list, c,
                        are known to GCC.

   OverlappingCaseBounds - returns TRUE if there were any overlapping bounds
                           in the case list, c.  It will generate an error
