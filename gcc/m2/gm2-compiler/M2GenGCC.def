    Description: provides an interface to GCC, essentially convert the
                 internal quadruples of m2f into a GCC tree structure.

(*
   ConvertQuadsToTree - runs through the quadruple list, Start..End, and converts it into
                        the GCC tree structure.
*)

PROCEDURE ConvertQuadsToTree (Start, End: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ResolveConstantExpressions - resolves constant expressions from the quadruple list.
                                It returns TRUE if one or more constants were folded.
                                When a constant symbol value is solved, the call back
                                p(sym) is invoked.
*)

PROCEDURE ResolveConstantExpressions (p: WalkAction; start, end: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   GetHighFromUnbounded - returns a Tree containing the value of
                          param.HIGH.
*)

PROCEDURE GetHighFromUnbounded (location: location_t; dim, param: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   StringToChar - if type=Char and str is a string (of size <= 1)
                  then convert the string into a character constant.
*)

PROCEDURE StringToChar (t: Tree; type, str: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   LValueToGenericPtr - returns a Tree representing symbol, sym.
                        It coerces a lvalue into an internal pointer type
*)

PROCEDURE LValueToGenericPtr (location: location_t; sym: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   ZConstToTypedConst - checks whether op1 and op2 are constants and
                        coerces, t, appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE ZConstToTypedConst (t: Tree; op1, op2: CARDINAL) : Tree ;


(*
   DoCopyString - returns trees:
                  t    number of bytes to be copied (including the nul)
                  op3t the string with the extra nul character
                       providing it fits.
*)

END M2GenGCC.
