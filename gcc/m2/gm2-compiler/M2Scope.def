    Description: provides a set of methods to derive the subset of quadruples
                 which were generated within a scope.

(*
   InitScopeBlock - creates a scope block containing all quadruples for the outer, scope.

PROCEDURE InitScopeBlock (scope: CARDINAL) : ScopeBlock ;


(*
   KillScopeBlock - destroys the ScopeBlock sb and assign sb to NIL.
*)

PROCEDURE KillScopeBlock (VAR sb: ScopeBlock) ;


(*
   ForeachScopeBlockDo2 - calls a procedure p for each block of contigeous quadruples
                          defining an outer scope sb.
