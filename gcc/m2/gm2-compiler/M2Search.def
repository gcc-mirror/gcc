   Description: M2Search provides a mechanism to search selected directories
                in an attempt to locate a given source file.

   FindSourceFile - attempts to locate the source file FileName.
                    If a file is found then TRUE is returned otherwise
                    FALSE is returned.
                    The parameter FullPath is set indicating the
                    absolute location of source FileName.
                    FullPath will be totally overwritten and should
                    not be initialized by InitString before this function
                    is called.
                    FullPath is set to NIL if this function returns FALSE.
                    FindSourceFile sets FullPath to a new string if successful.
                    The string FileName is not altered.
