   ParameterTypeCompatible - returns TRUE if the nth procedure parameter formal
                             is compatible with actual.  If the string is empty then
                             no error is issued.

                                   isvar: BOOLEAN) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   AssignmentTypeCompatible - returns TRUE if the des and the expr are assignment compatible.
                              If the string is empty then no error is issued.

(*
   ExpressionTypeCompatible - returns TRUE if the expressions, left and right,
                              are expression compatible.
                              If the string is empty then no error is issued.
