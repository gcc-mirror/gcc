(*
   Create - creates a temporary file. To make the file perminant
            the file must be renamed.
*)

PROCEDURE Create (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   Close - closes an open file.
*)

PROCEDURE Close (f: File) ;


(*
   Lookup - looks for a file, filename. If the file is found
            then, f, is opened. If it is not found and, newFile,
            is TRUE then a new file is created and attached to, f.
            If, newFile, is FALSE and no file was found then f.res
            is set to notdone.
*)

PROCEDURE Lookup (VAR f: File; filename: ARRAY OF CHAR; newFile: BOOLEAN) ;


(*
   Rename - rename a file and change a temporary file to a permanent
            file. f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE Rename (VAR f: File; newname: ARRAY OF CHAR) ;


(*
   Delete - deletes a file, name, and sets the f.res field.
            f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE Delete (name: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR f: File) ;


(*
   ReadWord - reads a WORD, w, from file, f.
              f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadWord (VAR f: File; VAR w: WORD) ;


(*
   WriteWord - writes one word to a file, f.
               f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteWord (VAR f: File; w: WORD) ;


(*
   ReadChar - reads one character from a file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadChar (VAR f: File; VAR ch: CHAR) ;


(*
   WriteChar - writes a character, ch, to a file, f.
               f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteChar (VAR f: File; ch: CHAR) ;


(*
   ReadByte - reads a BYTE, b, from file, f.
              f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadByte (VAR f: File; VAR b: BYTE) ;


(*
   WriteByte - writes one BYTE, b, to a file, f.
               f.res is set appropriately.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteByte (VAR f: File; b: BYTE) ;


(*
   ReadNBytes - reads a sequence of bytes from a file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadNBytes (VAR f: File; a: ADDRESS; amount: CARDINAL;
                      VAR actuallyRead: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteNBytes - writes a sequence of bytes to file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteNBytes (VAR f: File; a: ADDRESS; amount: CARDINAL;
                       VAR actuallyWritten: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   Again - returns the last character read to the internal buffer
           so that it can be read again.
*)

PROCEDURE Again (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   SetRead - puts the file, f, into the read state.
             The file position is unchanged.
*)

PROCEDURE SetRead (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   SetWrite - puts the file, f, into the write state.
              The file position is unchanged.
*)

PROCEDURE SetWrite (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   SetModify - puts the file, f, into the modify state.
               The file position is unchanged but the file can be
               read and written.
*)

PROCEDURE SetModify (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   SetOpen - places a file, f, into the open state. The file may
             have been in the read/write/modify state before and
             in which case the previous buffer contents are flushed
             and the file state is reset to open. The position is
             unaltered.
*)

PROCEDURE SetOpen (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   Reset - places a file, f, into the open state and reset the
           position to the start of the file.
*)

PROCEDURE Reset (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   SetPos - lseek to a position within a file.
*)

PROCEDURE SetPos (VAR f: File; high, low: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   GetPos - return the position within a file.
*)

PROCEDURE GetPos (VAR f: File; VAR high, low: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   Length - returns the length of file, in, high, and, low.
*)

PROCEDURE Length (VAR f: File; VAR high, low: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   Doio - effectively flushes a file in write mode, rereads the
          current buffer from disk if in read mode and writes
          and rereads the buffer if in modify mode.
*)

PROCEDURE Doio (VAR f: File) ;


(*
   FileNameChar - checks to see whether the character, ch, is
                  legal in a filename. nul is returned if the
                  character was illegal.
*)
