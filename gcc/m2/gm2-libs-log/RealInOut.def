   SetNoOfDecimalPlaces - number of decimal places WriteReal and

(*
   ReadReal - reads a real number, legal syntaxes include:

PROCEDURE ReadReal (VAR x: REAL) ;


(*
   WriteReal - writes a real to the terminal. The real number
               is right justified and, n, is the minimum field
               width.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteReal (x: REAL; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   WriteRealOct - writes the real to terminal in octal words.

                   width.

(*
   WriteLongRealOct - writes the LONGREAL to terminal in octal words.

                    width.
