DEFINITION MODULE BlockOps ;

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADDRESS ;


(*
   MoveBlockForward - moves, n, bytes from, src, to, dest.
                      Starts copying from src and keep copying
                      until, n, bytes have been copied.
*)

PROCEDURE BlockMoveForward (dest, src: ADDRESS; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   MoveBlockBackward - moves, n, bytes from, src, to, dest.
                       Starts copying from src+n and keeps copying
                       until, n, bytes have been copied.
                       The last datum to be copied will be the byte
                       at address, src.
*)

PROCEDURE BlockMoveBackward (dest, src: ADDRESS; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   BlockClear - fills, block..block+n-1, with zero's.
*)

PROCEDURE BlockClear (block: ADDRESS; n: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   BlockSet - fills, n, bytes starting at, block, with a pattern
              defined at address pattern..pattern+patternSize-1.
*)

PROCEDURE BlockSet (block: ADDRESS; n: CARDINAL;
                    pattern: ADDRESS; patternSize: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   BlockEqual - returns TRUE if the blocks defined, a..a+n-1, and,
                b..b+n-1 contain the same bytes.
*)

PROCEDURE BlockEqual (a, b: ADDRESS; n: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   BlockPosition - searches for a pattern as defined by
                   pattern..patternSize-1 in the block,
                   block..block+blockSize-1.  It returns
                   the offset from block indicating the
                   first occurence of, pattern.
                   MAX(CARDINAL) is returned if no match
                   is detected.

PROCEDURE BlockPosition (block: ADDRESS; blockSize: CARDINAL;
                         pattern: ADDRESS; patternSize: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;


END BlockOps.
