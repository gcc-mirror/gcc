DEFINITION MODULE SShortWholeIO;
 
  (* Input and output of whole numbers in decimal text form over
     default channels.  The read result is of the type
     IOConsts.ReadResults.
  *)
 
  (* The text form of a signed whole number is
       ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}
 
     The text form of an unsigned whole number is
       decimal digit, {decimal digit}
  *)
 
PROCEDURE ReadInt (VAR int: SHORTINT);
  (* Skips leading spaces, and removes any remaining characters
     from the default input channel that form part of a signed
     whole number.  The value of this number is assigned
     to int.  The read result is set to the value allRight,
     outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput.
  *)
 
PROCEDURE WriteInt (int: SHORTINT; width: CARDINAL);
  (* Writes the value of int to the default output channel in
     text form, in a field of the given minimum width.
  *)
 
PROCEDURE ReadCard (VAR card: SHORTCARD);
  (* Skips leading spaces, and removes any remaining characters
     from the default input channel that form part of an
     unsigned whole number.  The value of this number is
     assigned to card.  The read result is set to the value
     allRight, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput.
  *)
 
PROCEDURE WriteCard (card: SHORTCARD; width: CARDINAL);
  (* Writes the value of card to the default output channel in
     text form, in a field of the given minimum width.
