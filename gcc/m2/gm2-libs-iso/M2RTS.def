(*
   InstallTerminationProcedure - installs a procedure, p, which will
                                 be called when the procedure

                                 is invoked.  It returns TRUE is the

   ExecuteInitialProcedures - executes the initial procedures installed
                              by InstallInitialProcedure.

PROCEDURE ExecuteInitialProcedures ;


(*
   InstallInitialProcedure - installs a procedure to be executed just
                             before the BEGIN code section of the main
                             program module.

(*
   HALT - terminate the current program.  The procedure
          ExecuteTerminationProcedures
          is called before the program is stopped.  The parameter
          exitcode is optional.  If the parameter is not supplied
          HALT will call libc 'abort', otherwise it will exit with
          the code supplied.  Supplying a parameter to HALT has the
          same effect as calling ExitOnHalt with the same code and
          then calling HALT with no parameter.
*)

(*
   Halt - provides a more user friendly version of HALT, which takes
          four parameters to aid debugging.

   ExitOnHalt - if HALT is executed then call exit with the exit code, e.

   ErrorMessage - emits an error message to stderr and then calls exit (1).
