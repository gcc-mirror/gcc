   writeString - writes a string, s, to ChanId, cid.
                 The string, s, is not destroyed.

(*
   writeFieldWidth - writes a string, s, to ChanId, cid.
                     The string, s, is not destroyed and it
                     is prefixed by spaces so that at least,
                     width, characters are written.  If the
                     string, s, is longer than width then
                     no spaces are prefixed to the output
                     and the entire string is written.
