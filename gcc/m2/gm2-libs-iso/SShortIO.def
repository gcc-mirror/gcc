DEFINITION MODULE SShortIO;

  (* Input and output of short real numbers in decimal text form
     using default channels.  The read result is of the type
     IOConsts.ReadResults.
  *)

  (* The text form of a signed fixed-point real number is
       ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit},
       [".", {decimal digit}]

     The text form of a signed floating-point real number is
       signed fixed-point real number,
       "E", ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}
  *)

PROCEDURE ReadReal (VAR real: SHORTREAL);
  (* Skips leading spaces, and removes any remaining characters
     from the default input channel that form part of a signed
     fixed or floating point number. The value of this number
     is assigned to real.  The read result is set to the value
     allRight, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput.
  *)

PROCEDURE WriteFloat (real: SHORTREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL;
                      width: CARDINAL);
  (* Writes the value of real to the default output channel in
     floating-point text form, with sigFigs significant figures,
     in a field of the given minimum width.
  *)

PROCEDURE WriteEng (real: SHORTREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL;
                    width: CARDINAL);
  (* As for WriteFloat, except that the number is scaled with
     one to three digits in the whole number part, and with an
     exponent that is a multiple of three.
  *)

PROCEDURE WriteFixed (real: SHORTREAL; place: INTEGER;
                      width: CARDINAL);
  (* Writes the value of real to the default output channel in
     fixed-point text form, rounded to the given place relative
     to the decimal point, in a field of the given minimum width.
  *)

PROCEDURE WriteReal (real: SHORTREAL; width: CARDINAL);
  (* Writes the value of real to the default output channel, as
     WriteFixed if the sign and magnitude can be shown in the
     given width, or otherwise as WriteFloat. The number of
     places or significant digits depends on the given width.
  *)

END SShortIO.
