  (* Represents the start state of a finite state scanner for real
     numbers - assigns class of inputCh to chClass and a procedure
     representing the next state to nextState.

PROCEDURE FormatReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR): ConvResults;
  (* Returns the format of the string value for conversion to LONGREAL. *)

PROCEDURE ValueReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR): SHORTREAL;
  (* Returns the value corresponding to the real number string value
     str if str is well-formed; otherwise raises the ShortConv exception.
  *)

PROCEDURE LengthFloatReal (real: SHORTREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL): CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of characters in the floating-point string
     representation of real with sigFigs significant figures.
  *)

PROCEDURE LengthEngReal (real: SHORTREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL): CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of characters in the floating-point engineering
     string representation of real with sigFigs significant figures.
  *)

PROCEDURE LengthFixedReal (real: SHORTREAL; place: INTEGER): CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of characters in the fixed-point string
     representation of real rounded to the given place relative to the
     decimal point.
  *)

PROCEDURE IsRConvException (): BOOLEAN;
  (* Returns TRUE if the current coroutine is in the exceptional
     execution state because of the raising of an exception in a
     routine from this module; otherwise returns FALSE.
