DEFINITION MODULE ShortStr;

  (* SHORTREAL/string conversions *)

IMPORT
   ConvTypes;

TYPE
   (* strAllRight, strOutOfRange, strWrongFormat, strEmpty *)
   ConvResults = ConvTypes.ConvResults;

(* the string form of a signed fixed-point real number is
     ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}, [".",
     {decimal digit}]
*)

(* the string form of a signed floating-point real number is
     signed fixed-point real number, "E", ["+" | "-"],
     decimal digit, {decimal digit}
*)

PROCEDURE StrToReal (str: ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR real: SHORTREAL;
                     VAR res: ConvResults);
  (* Ignores any leading spaces in str. If the subsequent characters
     in str are in the format of a signed real number, assigns a
     corresponding value to real.  Assigns a value indicating the
     format of str to res.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToFloat (real: SHORTREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL;
                       VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real to floating-point string form, with
     sigFigs significant figures, and copies the possibly truncated
     result to str.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToEng (real: SHORTREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL;
                     VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real to floating-point string form, with
     sigFigs significant figures, and copies the possibly truncated
     result to str. The number is scaled with one to three digits
     in the whole number part and with an exponent that is a
     multiple of three.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToFixed (real: SHORTREAL; place: INTEGER;
                       VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real to fixed-point string form, rounded
     to the given place relative to the decimal point, and copies
     the possibly truncated result to str.
  *)

PROCEDURE RealToStr (real: SHORTREAL; VAR str: ARRAY OF CHAR);
  (* Converts the value of real as RealToFixed if the sign and
     magnitude can be shown within the capacity of str, or
     otherwise as RealToFloat, and copies the possibly truncated
     result to str. The number of places or significant digits
     depend on the capacity of str.
