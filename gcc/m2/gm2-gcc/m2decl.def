    DeclareKnownConstant - given a constant, value, of, type, create a constant in the GCC

                           as _all_ constants are declared in the global scope. The front end
                           deals with scoping rules - here we declare all constants with no names
                           in the global scope. This allows M2SubExp and constant folding routines
                           the liberty of operating with quadruples which all assume constants can
                           always be referenced.

                                type declaration and we ignore names.
