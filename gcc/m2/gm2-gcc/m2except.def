   InitExceptions - initialize this module, it declares the

                    the appropriate global tree variables.

   BuildThrow - builds a throw statement and return the tree.

(*
   BuildTryEnd - builds the end of the Try block and prepares
                 for the catch handlers.

(*
   BuildCatchBegin - creates a handler tree for the C++
                     statement 'catch (...) {'.
                     It returns the handler tree.

(*
   BuildCatchEnd - completes a try catch block.
                   It returns the, try_block, tree.
                   It creates the C++ statement

                   '}' which matches the catch above.
