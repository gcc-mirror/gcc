DEFINITION MODULE mcSearch ;


(* mcSearch provides a mechanism to search selected directories
   in an attempt to locate and open a given source file.  *)

FROM DynamicStrings IMPORT String ;


(*
   initSearchPath - initialise the compiler search, path.
                    The string path may take the form:

                    Path           ::= IndividualPath { ":" IndividualPath }
                    IndividualPath ::= "." | DirectoryPath
                    DirectoryPath  ::= [ "/" ] Name { "/" Name }
                    Name           ::= Letter { (Letter | Number) }
                    Letter         ::= A..Z | a..z
                    Number         ::= 0..9
*)

PROCEDURE initSearchPath (path: String) ;


(*
   prependSearchPath - prepends a new path to the initial search path.
*)

PROCEDURE prependSearchPath (path: String) ;


(*
   findSourceFile - attempts to locate the source file FileName.
                    If a file is found then TRUE is returned otherwise
                    FALSE is returned.
                    The parameter FullPath is set indicating the
                    absolute location of source FileName.
                    FullPath will be totally overwritten and should
                    not be initialized by InitString before this function
                    is called.
                    FindSourceFile sets FullPath to a new string if successful.
*)

   findSourceDefFile - attempts to find the definition module for
                       a module, Stem. If successful it returns
                       the full path and returns TRUE. If unsuccessful
                       then FALSE is returned and FullPath is set to NIL.

(*
   findSourceModFile - attempts to find the implementation module for
                       a module, Stem. If successful it returns
                       the full path and returns TRUE. If unsuccessful
                       then FALSE is returned and FullPath is set to NIL.

(*
   setDefExtension - sets the default extension for definition modules to, ext.
                     The string, ext, should be deallocated by the caller at
                     an appropriate time.
*)

PROCEDURE setDefExtension (ext: String) ;


(*
   setModExtension - sets the default extension for implementation and program
                     modules to, ext. The string, ext, should be deallocated
                     by the caller at an appropriate time.
