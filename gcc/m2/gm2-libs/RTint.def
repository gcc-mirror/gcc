DEFINITION MODULE RTint ;

(* Provides users of the COROUTINES library with the
   ability to create interrupt sources based on
   file descriptors and timeouts.  *)

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADDRESS ;

TYPE
   DispatchVector = PROCEDURE (CARDINAL, CARDINAL, ADDRESS) ;


(*
   InitInputVector - returns an interrupt vector which is associated
                     with the file descriptor, fd.
*)

PROCEDURE InitInputVector (fd: INTEGER; pri: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   InitOutputVector - returns an interrupt vector which is associated
                      with the file descriptor, fd.
*)

PROCEDURE InitOutputVector (fd: INTEGER; pri: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   InitTimeVector - returns an interrupt vector associated with
                    the relative time.
*)

PROCEDURE InitTimeVector (micro, secs: CARDINAL; pri: CARDINAL) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   ReArmTimeVector - reprimes the vector, vec, to deliver an interrupt
                     at the new relative time.
*)

PROCEDURE ReArmTimeVector (vec: CARDINAL; micro, secs: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   GetTimeVector - assigns, micro, and, secs, with the remaining
                   time before this interrupt will expire.
                   This value is only updated when a Listen
                   occurs.
*)

PROCEDURE GetTimeVector (vec: CARDINAL; VAR micro, secs: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   AttachVector - adds the pointer, p, to be associated with the interrupt
                  vector. It returns the previous value attached to this
                  vector.
*)

PROCEDURE AttachVector (vec: CARDINAL; p: ADDRESS) : ADDRESS ;


(*
   IncludeVector - includes, vec, into the dispatcher list of
                   possible interrupt causes.
*)

PROCEDURE IncludeVector (vec: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ExcludeVector - excludes, vec, from the dispatcher list of
                   possible interrupt causes.
*)

PROCEDURE ExcludeVector (vec: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   Listen - will either block indefinitely (until an interrupt)
            or alteratively will test to see whether any interrupts
            are pending.
            If a pending interrupt was found then, call, is called
            and then this procedure returns.
            It only listens for interrupts > pri.
*)

(*
   Init - allows the user to force the initialize order.
*)
