(*
   ExecuteTerminationProcedures - calls each installed termination
                                  procedure in reverse order.
*)

PROCEDURE ExecuteTerminationProcedures ;


(*
   InstallTerminationProcedure - installs a procedure, p, which will
                                 be called when the procedure
                                 ExecuteTerminationProcedures
                                 is invoked.  It returns TRUE is the
                                 procedure is installed.
*)

PROCEDURE InstallTerminationProcedure (p: PROC) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   ExecuteInitialProcedures - executes the initial procedures installed
                              by InstallInitialProcedure.
*)

PROCEDURE ExecuteInitialProcedures ;


(*
   InstallInitialProcedure - installs a procedure to be executed just
                             before the BEGIN code section of the main
                             program module.
*)

PROCEDURE InstallInitialProcedure (p: PROC) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   Terminate - provides compatibility for pim.  It call exit with
               the exitcode provided in a prior call to ExitOnHalt
               (or zero if ExitOnHalt was never called).  It does
               not call ExecuteTerminationProcedures.
*)

PROCEDURE Terminate <* noreturn *> ;


(*
   HALT - terminate the current program.  The procedure Terminate
          is called before the program is stopped.  The parameter
          exitcode is optional.  If the parameter is not supplied
          HALT will call libc 'abort', otherwise it will exit with
          the code supplied.  Supplying a parameter to HALT has the
          same effect as calling ExitOnHalt with the same code and
          then calling HALT with no parameter.
*)

PROCEDURE HALT ([exitcode: INTEGER = -1]) <* noreturn *> ;


(*
   Halt - provides a more user friendly version of HALT, which takes
          four parameters to aid debugging.
*)

PROCEDURE Halt (file: ARRAY OF CHAR; line: CARDINAL;
                function: ARRAY OF CHAR; description: ARRAY OF CHAR)
		<* noreturn *> ;


(*
   ExitOnHalt - if HALT is executed then call exit with the exit code, e.
*)

PROCEDURE ExitOnHalt (e: INTEGER) ;


(*
   ErrorMessage - emits an error message to stderr and then calls exit (1).
*)

PROCEDURE ErrorMessage (message: ARRAY OF CHAR;
                        file: ARRAY OF CHAR;
                        line: CARDINAL;
                        function: ARRAY OF CHAR) <* noreturn *> ;


(*
   Length - returns the length of a string, a. This is called whenever
            the user calls LENGTH and the parameter cannot be calculated
            at compile time.
*)

PROCEDURE Length (a: ARRAY OF CHAR) : CARDINAL ;
