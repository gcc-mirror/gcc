   ======================================================

PROCEDURE ADR (VAR v: <anytype>): ADDRESS;
  (* Returns the address of variable v. *)

PROCEDURE SIZE (v: <type>) : ZType;
  (* Returns the number of BYTES used to store a v of
     any specified <type>.  Only available if -fpim2 is used.
  *)

PROCEDURE TSIZE (<type>) : CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of BYTES used to store a value of the
     specified <type>.
  *)

PROCEDURE ROTATE (val: <a set type>;
                  num: INTEGER): <type of first parameter>;
  (* Returns a bit sequence obtained from val by rotating up/right
     or down/right by the absolute value of num.  The direction is
     down/right if the sign of num is negative, otherwise the direction
     is up/left.
  *)

PROCEDURE SHIFT (val: <a set type>;
                 num: INTEGER): <type of first parameter>;
  (* Returns a bit sequence obtained from val by shifting up/left
     or down/right by the absolute value of num, introducing
     zeros as necessary.  The direction is down/right if the sign of
     num is negative, otherwise the direction is up/left.
  *)

PROCEDURE THROW (i: INTEGER) <* noreturn *> ;
  (*
     THROW is a GNU extension and was not part of the PIM or ISO
     standards.  It throws an exception which will be caught by the
     EXCEPT block (assuming it exists).  This is a compiler builtin
     function which interfaces to the GCC exception handling runtime
     system.
     GCC uses the term throw, hence the naming distinction between
     the GCC builtin and the Modula-2 runtime library procedure Raise.
     The later library procedure Raise will call SYSTEM.THROW after
     performing various housekeeping activities.
  *)

PROCEDURE TBITSIZE (<type>) : CARDINAL ;
  (* Returns the minimum number of bits necessary to represent
     <type>.  This procedure function is only useful for determining
     the number of bits used for any type field within a packed RECORD.
     It is not particularly useful elsewhere since <type> might be
     optimized for speed, for example a BOOLEAN could occupy a WORD.
