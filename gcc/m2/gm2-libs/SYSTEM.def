(*
   all the functions below are declared internally to gm2
   ======================================================

PROCEDURE ADR (VAR v: <anytype>): ADDRESS;
  (* Returns the address of variable v. *)

PROCEDURE SIZE (v: <type>) : ZType;
  (* Returns the number of BYTES used to store a v of
     any specified <type>.  Only available if -fpim2 is used.
  *)

PROCEDURE TSIZE (<type>) : CARDINAL;
  (* Returns the number of BYTES used to store a value of the
     specified <type>.
  *)

PROCEDURE ROTATE (val: <a set type>;
                  num: INTEGER): <type of first parameter>;
  (* Returns a bit sequence obtained from val by rotating up/right
     or down/right by the absolute value of num.  The direction is
     down/right if the sign of num is negative, otherwise the direction
     is up/left.
  *)

PROCEDURE SHIFT (val: <a set type>;
                 num: INTEGER): <type of first parameter>;
  (* Returns a bit sequence obtained from val by shifting up/left
     or down/right by the absolute value of num, introducing
     zeros as necessary.  The direction is down/right if the sign of
     num is negative, otherwise the direction is up/left.
  *)

PROCEDURE THROW (i: INTEGER) <* noreturn *> ;
  (*
     THROW is a GNU extension and was not part of the PIM or ISO
     standards.  It throws an exception which will be caught by the
     EXCEPT block (assuming it exists).  This is a compiler builtin
     function which interfaces to the GCC exception handling runtime
     system.
     GCC uses the term throw, hence the naming distinction between
     the GCC builtin and the Modula-2 runtime library procedure Raise.
     The later library procedure Raise will call SYSTEM.THROW after
     performing various housekeeping activities.
  *)

PROCEDURE TBITSIZE (<type>) : CARDINAL ;
  (* Returns the minimum number of bits necessary to represent
     <type>.  This procedure function is only useful for determining
     the number of bits used for any type field within a packed RECORD.
     It is not particularly useful elsewhere since <type> might be
     optimized for speed, for example a BOOLEAN could occupy a WORD.
  *)
*)

(* The following procedures are invoked by GNU Modula-2 to
   shift non word sized set types. They are not strictly part
   of the core PIM Modula-2, however they are used
   to implement the SHIFT procedure defined above,
   which are in turn used by the Logitech compatible libraries.

   Users will access these procedures by using the procedure
   SHIFT above and GNU Modula-2 will map SHIFT onto one of
   the following procedures.
*)

(*
   ShiftVal - is a runtime procedure whose job is to implement
              the SHIFT procedure of ISO SYSTEM. GNU Modula-2 will
              inline a SHIFT of a single WORD sized set and will only
              call this routine for larger sets.

(*
   ShiftLeft - performs the shift left for a multi word set.
               This procedure might be called by the back end of
               GNU Modula-2 depending whether amount is known at
               compile time.
