(*
   InitIndex - creates and returns an Index.
*)

PROCEDURE InitIndex (low: CARDINAL) : Index ;


(*
   KillIndex - returns Index to free storage.
*)

PROCEDURE KillIndex (i: Index) : Index ;


(*
   DebugIndex - turns on debugging within an index.
*)

PROCEDURE DebugIndex (i: Index) : Index ;


(*
   InBounds - returns TRUE if indice, n, is within the bounds
              of the dynamic array.
*)

PROCEDURE InBounds (i: Index; n: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   HighIndice - returns the last legally accessible indice of this array.
*)

PROCEDURE HighIndice (i: Index) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   LowIndice - returns the first legally accessible indice of this array.
*)

PROCEDURE LowIndice (i: Index) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   PutIndice - places, a, into the dynamic array at position i[n]
*)

PROCEDURE PutIndice (i: Index; n: CARDINAL; a: ADDRESS) ;


(*
   GetIndice - retrieves, element i[n] from the dynamic array.
*)

PROCEDURE GetIndice (i: Index; n: CARDINAL) : ADDRESS ;


(*
   IsIndiceInIndex - returns TRUE if, a, is in the index, i.
*)

PROCEDURE IsIndiceInIndex (i: Index; a: ADDRESS) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   RemoveIndiceFromIndex - removes, a, from Index, i.
*)

PROCEDURE RemoveIndiceFromIndex (i: Index; a: ADDRESS) ;


(*
   DeleteIndice - delete i[j] from the array.
*)

PROCEDURE DeleteIndice (i: Index; j: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   IncludeIndiceIntoIndex - if the indice is not in the index, then
                            add it at the end.
*)

PROCEDURE IncludeIndiceIntoIndex (i: Index; a: ADDRESS) ;


(*
   ForeachIndiceInIndexDo - for each j indice of i, call procedure p(i[j])
*)

END Indexing.
