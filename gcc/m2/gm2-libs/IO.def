   Description: provides Read, Write, Errors procedures that map onto UNIX
                file descriptors 0, 1 and 2. This is achieved by using
                FIO if we are in buffered mode and using libc.write
                if not.

EXPORT QUALIFIED Read, Write, Error,
                 UnBufferedMode, BufferedMode,
                 EchoOn, EchoOff ;


PROCEDURE Read (VAR ch: CHAR) ;
PROCEDURE Write (ch: CHAR) ;
PROCEDURE Error (ch: CHAR) ;


(*
   UnBufferedMode - places file descriptor, fd, into an unbuffered mode.
*)

PROCEDURE UnBufferedMode (fd: INTEGER; input: BOOLEAN) ;


(*
   BufferedMode - places file descriptor, fd, into a buffered mode.
*)

PROCEDURE BufferedMode (fd: INTEGER; input: BOOLEAN) ;


(*
   EchoOn - turns on echoing for file descriptor, fd.  This
            only really makes sence for a file descriptor opened
            for terminal input or maybe some specific file descriptor
            which is attached to a particular piece of hardware.
*)

PROCEDURE EchoOn (fd: INTEGER; input: BOOLEAN) ;


(*
   EchoOff - turns off echoing for file descriptor, fd.  This
             only really makes sence for a file descriptor opened
             for terminal input or maybe some specific file descriptor
             which is attached to a particular piece of hardware.

PROCEDURE EchoOff (fd: INTEGER; input: BOOLEAN) ;


END IO.
