VAR
   StdIn, StdOut, StdErr: File ;



(*
   IsNoError - returns a TRUE if no error has occured on file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE IsNoError (f: File) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   IsActive - returns TRUE if the file, f, is still active.
*)

PROCEDURE IsActive (f: File) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   Exists - returns TRUE if a file named, fname exists for reading.
*)

PROCEDURE Exists (fname: ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   OpenToRead - attempts to open a file, fname, for reading and
                it returns this file.
                The success of this operation can be checked by
                calling IsNoError.
*)

PROCEDURE OpenToRead (fname: ARRAY OF CHAR) : File ;


(*
   OpenToWrite - attempts to open a file, fname, for write and
                 it returns this file.
                 The success of this operation can be checked by
                 calling IsNoError.
*)

PROCEDURE OpenToWrite (fname: ARRAY OF CHAR) : File ;


(*
   OpenForRandom - attempts to open a file, fname, for random access
                   read or write and it returns this file.
                   The success of this operation can be checked by
                   calling IsNoError.
                   towrite, determines whether the file should be
                   opened for writing or reading.
                   newfile, determines whether a file should be
                   created if towrite is TRUE or whether the
                   previous file should be left alone,
                   allowing this descriptor to seek
                   and modify an existing file.
*)

PROCEDURE OpenForRandom (fname: ARRAY OF CHAR;
                         towrite, newfile: BOOLEAN) : File ;


(*
   Close - close a file which has been previously opened using:
           OpenToRead, OpenToWrite, OpenForRandom.
           It is correct to close a file which has an error status.
*)

PROCEDURE Close (f: File) ;


(* the following functions are functionally equivalent to the above
   except they allow C style names.
*)

PROCEDURE exists        (fname: ADDRESS; flength: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;

(*
   FlushBuffer - flush contents of the FIO file, f, to libc.
*)

PROCEDURE FlushBuffer (f: File) ;


(*
   ReadNBytes - reads nBytes of a file into memory area, dest, returning
                the number of bytes actually read.
                This function will consume from the buffer and then
                perform direct libc reads. It is ideal for large reads.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadNBytes (f: File; nBytes: CARDINAL;
                      dest: ADDRESS) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   ReadAny - reads HIGH (a) + 1 bytes into, a.  All input
             is fully buffered, unlike ReadNBytes and thus is more
             suited to small reads.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadAny (f: File; VAR a: ARRAY OF BYTE) ;


(*
   WriteNBytes - writes nBytes from memory area src to a file
                 returning the number of bytes actually written.
                 This function will flush the buffer and then
                 write the nBytes using a direct write from libc.
                 It is ideal for large writes.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteNBytes (f: File; nBytes: CARDINAL;
                       src: ADDRESS) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   WriteAny - writes HIGH (a) + 1 bytes onto, file, f.  All output
              is fully buffered, unlike WriteNBytes and thus is more
              suited to small writes.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteAny (f: File; VAR a: ARRAY OF BYTE) ;


(*
   WriteChar - writes a single character to file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteChar (f: File; ch: CHAR) ;


(*
   EOF - tests to see whether a file, f, has reached end of file.
*)

PROCEDURE EOF (f: File) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   EOLN - tests to see whether a file, f, is about to read a newline.
          It does NOT consume the newline.  It reads the next character
          and then immediately unreads the character.
*)

PROCEDURE EOLN (f: File) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   WasEOLN - tests to see whether a file, f, has just read a newline
             character.
*)

PROCEDURE WasEOLN (f: File) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   ReadChar - returns a character read from file, f.
              Sensible to check with IsNoError or EOF after calling
              this function.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadChar (f: File) : CHAR ;


(*
   UnReadChar - replaces a character, ch, back into file, f.
                This character must have been read by ReadChar
                and it does not allow successive calls.  It may
                only be called if the previous read was successful,
                end of file or end of line seen.
*)

PROCEDURE UnReadChar (f: File ; ch: CHAR) ;


(*
   WriteLine - writes out a linefeed to file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteLine (f: File) ;


(*
   WriteString - writes a string to file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteString (f: File; a: ARRAY OF CHAR) ;


(*
   ReadString - reads a string from file, f, into string, a.
                It terminates the string if HIGH is reached or
                if a newline is seen or an error occurs.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadString (f: File; VAR a: ARRAY OF CHAR) ;


(*
   WriteCardinal - writes a CARDINAL to file, f.
                   It writes the binary image of the CARDINAL.
                   to file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteCardinal (f: File; c: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   ReadCardinal - reads a CARDINAL from file, f.
                  It reads a bit image of a CARDINAL
                  from file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE ReadCardinal (f: File) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   GetUnixFileDescriptor - returns the UNIX file descriptor of a file.
                           Useful when combining FIO.mod with select
                           (in Selective.def - but note the comments in
                            Selective about using read/write primatives)
*)

PROCEDURE GetUnixFileDescriptor (f: File) : INTEGER ;


(*
   SetPositionFromBeginning - sets the position from the beginning
                              of the file.
*)

PROCEDURE SetPositionFromBeginning (f: File; pos: LONGINT) ;


(*
   SetPositionFromEnd - sets the position from the end of the file.
*)

PROCEDURE SetPositionFromEnd (f: File; pos: LONGINT) ;


(*
   FindPosition - returns the current absolute position in file, f.
*)

PROCEDURE FindPosition (f: File) : LONGINT ;


(*
   GetFileName - assigns, a, with the filename associated with, f.
*)

PROCEDURE GetFileName (f: File; VAR a: ARRAY OF CHAR) ;


(*
   getFileName - returns the address of the filename associated with, f.
*)

PROCEDURE getFileName (f: File) : ADDRESS ;


(*
   getFileNameLength - returns the number of characters associated with
                       filename, f.
*)

PROCEDURE getFileNameLength (f: File) : CARDINAL ;


(*
   FlushOutErr - flushes, StdOut, and, StdErr.
*)

PROCEDURE FlushOutErr ;


END FIO.
