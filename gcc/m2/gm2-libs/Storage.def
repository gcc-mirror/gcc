DEFINITION MODULE Storage ;

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADDRESS ;

EXPORT QUALIFIED ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, REALLOCATE, Available ;



(*
   ALLOCATE - attempt to allocate memory from the heap.
              NIL is returned in, a, if ALLOCATE fails.
*)

PROCEDURE ALLOCATE (VAR a: ADDRESS ; Size: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   DEALLOCATE - return, Size, bytes to the heap.
                The variable, a, is set to NIL.
*)

PROCEDURE DEALLOCATE (VAR a: ADDRESS ; Size: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   REALLOCATE - attempts to reallocate storage. The address,
                a, should either be NIL in which case ALLOCATE
                is called, or alternatively it should have already
                been initialized by ALLOCATE. The allocated storage
                is resized accordingly.
*)

PROCEDURE REALLOCATE (VAR a: ADDRESS; Size: CARDINAL) ;


(*
   Available - returns TRUE if, Size, bytes can be allocated.
*)

PROCEDURE Available (Size: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN ;


END Storage.
