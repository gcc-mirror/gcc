   OpenToRead - attempts to open a file, fname, for reading and
                it returns this file.
                The success of this operation can be checked by
                calling IsNoError.

   OpenToWrite - attempts to open a file, fname, for write and
                 it returns this file.
                 The success of this operation can be checked by
                 calling IsNoError.

   OpenForRandom - attempts to open a file, fname, for random access
                   read or write and it returns this file.
                   The success of this operation can be checked by

                   be left alone, allowing this descriptor to seek
                   and modify an existing file.

(*
   WriteS - writes a string, s, to, file. It returns the String, s.

   ReadS - reads a string, s, from, file. It returns the String, s.
           It stops reading the string at the end of line or end of file.
           It consumes the newline at the end of line but does not place
