(*
   Exists - returns TRUE if a file named, fname exists for reading.
*)

PROCEDURE Exists (fname: String) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   OpenToRead - attempts to open a file, fname, for reading and
                it returns this file.
                The success of this operation can be checked by
                calling IsNoError.
*)

PROCEDURE OpenToRead (fname: String) : File ;


(*
   OpenToWrite - attempts to open a file, fname, for write and
                 it returns this file.
                 The success of this operation can be checked by
                 calling IsNoError.
*)

PROCEDURE OpenToWrite (fname: String) : File ;


(*
   OpenForRandom - attempts to open a file, fname, for random access
                   read or write and it returns this file.
                   The success of this operation can be checked by
                   calling IsNoError.
                   towrite, determines whether the file should be
                   opened for writing or reading.
                   if towrite is TRUE or whether the previous file should
                   be left alone, allowing this descriptor to seek
                   and modify an existing file.

PROCEDURE OpenForRandom (fname: String; towrite, newfile: BOOLEAN) : File ;


(*
   WriteS - writes a string, s, to, file. It returns the String, s.
*)

PROCEDURE WriteS (file: File; s: String) : String ;


(*
   ReadS - reads a string, s, from, file. It returns the String, s.
           It stops reading the string at the end of line or end of file.
           It consumes the newline at the end of line but does not place
           this into the returned string.
