# The following pair of rules has this effect:
# genconfig is run only if the md has changed since genconfig was last run;
# but the file insn-config.h is touched only when its contents actually change.

# Each of the other insn-* files is handled by a similar pair of rules.

# This causes an anomaly in the results of make -n
# because insn-* is older than s-*
# and thus make -n thinks that insn-* will be updated
# and force recompilation of things that depend on it.
# We use move-if-change precisely to avoid such recompilation.
# But there is no way to teach make -n that it will be avoided.

# Each of the insn-*.[ch] rules has a semicolon at the end,
# for otherwise the system Make on SunOS 4.1 never tries
# to recompile insn-*.o.  To avoid problems and extra noise from
# versions of make which don't like empty commands (nothing after the
# trailing `;'), we call true for each.

#
# Deletion of files made during compilation.
# There are four levels of this:
#   `mostlyclean', `clean', `distclean' and `maintainer-clean'.
# `mostlyclean' is useful while working on a particular type of machine.
# It deletes most, but not all, of the files made by compilation.
# It does not delete libgcc.a or its parts, so it won't have to be recompiled.
# `clean' deletes everything made by running `make all'.
# `distclean' also deletes the files made by config.
# `maintainer-clean' also deletes everything that could be regenerated
# automatically, except for `configure'.
# We remove as much from the language subdirectories as we can
# (less duplicated code).

# These targets compare the object files in the current directory with

# about cmp and uses the tail command to skip.  ./ avoids a bug in
# some versions of tail.  The "gnu" targets use gnu cmp (diffutils
# v2.4 or later), to avoid running tail and the overhead of twice
# copying each object file.  Likewise, the "fast" targets use the skip
# parameter of cmp available on some systems to accomplish the same
# thing.  An exit status of 1 is precisely the result we're looking
# for (other values mean other problems).
