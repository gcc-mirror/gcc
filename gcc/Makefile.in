# The following pair of rules has this effect:
# genconfig is run only if the md has changed since genconfig was last run;
# but the file insn-config.h is touched only when its contents actually change.

# Each of the other insn-* files is handled by a similar pair of rules.

# This causes an anomaly in the results of make -n
# because insn-* is older than s-*
# and thus make -n thinks that insn-* will be updated
# and force recompilation of things that depend on it.
# We use move-if-change precisely to avoid such recompilation.
# But there is no way to teach make -n that it will be avoided.

# Each of the insn-*.[ch] rules has a semicolon at the end,
# for otherwise the system Make on SunOS 4.1 never tries
# to recompile insn-*.o.  To avoid problems and extra noise from
# versions of make which don't like empty commands (nothing after the
# trailing `;'), we call true for each.
