Mon Nov 28 01:46:12 1988  Michael Tiemann  (mdt at choctaw)

	* c-parse.y (yylex): Typo, `=' for `==' making wide strings.

	* sparc.md (various places): make sure that all patterns which store
	can store using const0_rtx (i.e., make all operands to `st' %rx).

	* output-sparc.c (various places): changed dispatches on SYMBOL_REF
	to dispatches on CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P since we now recognize any CONST
	(and not just SYMBOL_REFs).  Don't recognize special case CONST for
	output_block_move.  Compiler doesn't have enough information to use
	it.

	* stmt.c (expand_fixup): If the control stack is nested within the
	nesting stack, then no fixup is needed.  Otherwise, compiler must
	check for possible fixups between the current nesting stack and the

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_type): It's not a bug if a RECORD_TYPE
	has a typedef as its TYPE_NAME.  That happens in C++.

	* Make each `asm' with operands record its source file/line
	with reg-notes.  It doesn't work to emit a special note before the insn
	because the insn can be moved by loop_optimize.
	* stmt.c (expand_asm_operands): New args FILENAME, LINE.
	Record them in the insn, in reg notes.
	* c-typeck.c (c_expand_asm_operands): New args, passed along.

	specify Pmode as the mode for push_reloads, in case of CONST_INT.

	* expr.c (emit_push_insn): Fix calc. of space needed when PARTIAL > 0.

	* reload.c (push_reload): Allow VOIDmode for INMODE, OUTMODE;
	default the mode from the operand values.

	* tree.def (METHOD_TYPE): Changed definition so that TREE_TYPE (m)
	(where m is a METHOD_TYPE) is the type of the return value of the
	method, not the FUNCTION_TYPE from which the METHOD_TYPE is derived.

	This can cause the use of multiple insns with same output reg,

	No need to reset elements out of range of prev block's NEXT_QTY.
	(reg_is_born, reg_is_set, wipe_dead_reg):

	(cse_insn): Don't call find_reg_note if REG_NOTES is 0.

	* cse.c (cse_insn): Store modified SET_SRC even if there's a REG_EQUIV.
	Inhibition was needed when the SET_SRC was the only place to find the

	* cse.c (cse_insn): Return very early for (set (reg) (call...)).
	Mainly to save time.
	(cse-insn) Old code to add REG_WAS_0 note wasted time but did nothing.

	* expr.c (clear_pending_stack_adjust): Really do clear it,
	if current fcn doesn't want to be inline.

	* cse.c (cse_insn): Speedup: instead of safe_hash, use canon_hash
	or HASHREG.

	just assume value is 1.
	(propagate_block): Don't call mark_{used,set}_regs for a stack-pop
	since if it isn't dead it has no effect on any useful life data.
	(mark_set_1): Return quickly if setting stack-ptr, and almost as
	quickly if setting any hard reg.
	(mark_used_regs): Likewise for refs.
	Also don't scan the vector of an ADDR_VEC or ADDR_DIFF_VEC.
	(volatile_refs_p): Likewise.

	* varasm.c (output_constant): Discard NOP_EXPR and CONVERT_EXPR
	in integer case (they were for casting a pointer).

	* parse.y (compstmt_or_error): Parse a compstmt after ignoring error.
	Use this for fctn body so that an error after store_parm_decls
	won't recover to xdecls and call store_parm_decls again.
	Typical cause was missing semi at end of last parmdecl.

	* parse.y: Add missing semicolons in actions.
	(yylex): Don't use yylloc.

Sun Jun  5 16:14:40 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* typecheck.c (build_array_ref): Check arg types here, to make
	error message more accurate (not about "addition").

Thu Jun  2 02:41:40 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at rice-krispies.ai.mit.edu)

	* cccp.c (collect_expansion): `#' isn't special if -traditional.

	unless the parm got a hard reg assigned.

	* tm-encore.h (ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE): Use 0f... not 0d...

	* cse.c (fold_rtx):
	* symout.c (subrange_p):  likewise.

	* local-alloc.c (block_alloc): If operands 1 and 2 commute,
	try tying output to operand 2 if operand 1 won't do.

	* toplev.c (compile_file): Pass main_input_file to symout_init.

	* tree.c (build_real, build_real_from_int_cst):
	Call CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE if it's defined, to report out-of-range values.

	* tree.c (build_real, build_real_from_int_cst): New 1st arg TYPE.
	* parse.y (yylex): Pass this arg; requires parsing suffixes first.
	* fold-const.c (fold, combine, fold_convert): Pass this arg.
	Handling of float binops in `combine' simplified.

	* tm-encore.h (CPP_PREDEFINES): Remove -Dencore since CC lacks it.

	* final.c (output_source_line): Let ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE
	be used for SDB also.

	like current_obstack.

	* decl.c (finish_decl): Error in test for zero-size array warning.

	* reload.c (find_equiv_reg): New arg MODE specifies mode in which
	an equivalent value is needed.  Equivalence must be good in that mode.
	In addition, notice overlap with multiword register modes.
	Simplify, knowing that registers have already been renumbered.
	It was invalidating memory-goals too easily; setting a reg
	only invalidates memory-goal if its address varies.
	* reload.c, reload1.c, jump.c: Calls pass the new argument.

	* cccp.c: For correct ANSI, must reject `$' in identifiers.
	(dollars_in_ident): Variable says whether to allow them.

	(main): dollars_in_ident is set to 0 by -$, to 1 by -traditional.
	(rescan, do_define): Delete former pedantic warnings for `$'.
	(initialize_char_syntax, initialize_builtins): Inits split to two
	functions; former is called after options are scanned
	so `$' is in is_idchar conditionally.
	* gcc.c: For -ansi, pass -$ to cccp.
	* toplev.c, flags.h: Define dollars_in_ident.
	* parse.y (yylex): Treat $ as punctuation unless dollars_in_ident.
	Delete old pedantic warning about $.
	* tm-vms.h: Define DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS as 1.

	* cccp.c (rescan): Preprocessing numbers can have signs, after `e'.

	* integrate.c (expand_inline_function): Abort, don't return failure,
	if max_regno is too low.  I believe this can't happen.

	* typecheck.c (build_binary_op_nodefault):
	For ordered comparisons, no pedantic warning about void *.
	For MAX, MIN, ditto, and also don't allow pointer vs 0.

	print error instead of aborting.

	* regclass.c (reg_class_record): Ignore `&' in constraint.

Sun May 29 00:20:23 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	Add comment saying what to do on system V.

	* tree.c (suspend_momentary): Switch to the saveable_obstack
	for the sake of inline functions.

	* flags.h (enum debugger): New enum for write_symbols.
	* toplev.c, varasm.c, final.c: Use the enum constants where appro.
	Add calls to sdbout paralleling the calls to dbxout;
	put each in the appropriate conditional {SDB,DBX}_DEBUGGING_INFO.

	* toplev.c (main): Delete -noreg option; it's now the default.
	Make -O an alias for -opt.  Rename -g to -gg.  -g is alias for -G.
	Accept and ignore -Wtrigraphs.
	* gcc.c: Simplify the specs.

	* toplev.c (compile_file), tm-*.h:
	ASM_FILE_START is now a statement, not just a string to be output.
	Output it *after* determining the real source file name.

	* fold-const.c (fold): Simplify x >= CST to x > CST-1 (CST positive).
	To simplify this, canonicalize relationals to put constat last.

	* decl.c (duplicate_decls): Make a 2nd errmsg to show previous decl.

	* cccp.c (file_size_and_mode): Delete temporary VMS bootstrap patch.

	* final.c, symout.c: Check DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO, not NO_DBX_FORMAT.

	* genemit.c (gen_expand): Notice a CALL inside a PARALLEL.

	* regclass.c (init_reg_sets_1): Part of init_reg_set is put in this
	new fn which is called after options are scanned.
	Now CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE can depend on the options.
	(fix_register): Just alter the data that init_reg_sets_1 will look at.

	* reload1.c (reload): Don't complain if two different but tieable
	modes require groups of the same regclass (assuming same size group).

	* cccp.c: Add 3rd arg to all `open' calls.

	* emit-rtl.c (gen_sequence): If LEN is 1, avoid looking at PATTERN
	of something that doesn't have one.

	* reload1.c (alter_frame_pointer_addresses): frame pointer can
	occur by itself, not just inside a PLUS.
	(reload): Call eliminate_frame_pointer before reload_as_needed.
	Otherwise the latter can make reload insns that copy the frame ptr
	to a data reg, but 68k can't copy sp+const to a data reg.

	* decl.c (implicitly_declare): Always save the implicit decl
	permanently.  Reuse an old one if it exists.
	* tree.c (resume_temporary_allocation): Used after `end_temporary...'
	to go back to temporary allocation.

	* stor-layout (layout_{type,decl}): Call variable_size.
	(variable_size): Turn a size into a SAVE_EXPR and either compute
	it right away or put it on a list to be computed later.
	(get_pending_sizes): Return that list and clear it out.
	* stmt.c (expand_start_function): Tell `variable_size' to compute
	sizes right away, and compute those saved on the list.
	(expand_end_function): Tell it to put them on a list.

Fri May 27 00:02:34 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_symbol): For local static var, use 'V', not 'v'.

	* gcc.c (main): Don't handle SIGHUP or SIGTERM if shell ignored it.

	* Makefile, gcc.c: Propagate Make var `libdir' to gcc search path.

	* expr.c (expand_expr): a PARM_DECL with no rtl can occur in size of
	`a' in `foo (a,i) int i; struct {int x[i];} a;', so report an error.

	* flow.c (insn_dead_p): insn that makes stack bigger is never dead.
	* combine.c (try_combine): Don't splice out stores into stack ptr.

	* reload.c (find_equiv_reg): Test given regno for OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P.

	* varasm.c (assemble_variable): Use saveable_obstack for allocation.

	* Don't fail to output a static inline function that was referenced
	via a local extern decl before its definition.

	mark the identifier as well.
	* decl.c (start_function): If identifier was marked addressable,
	propagate it to the function.

	* parse.y (yylex): Check for ERANGE after atof is called.
	(Sun doesn't report ERANGE.)

	(asm_operands): Do allow this to be empty.

	* reload.c (operands_match_p): Don't let REG and SUBREG match
	if the reg isn't a hard reg.
	No longer nec. to check reg_renumber, now that reload
	substitutes the hard regno.

	* reload1.c (reload): Counting existing spilled groups,
	check HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK so we don't get fooled by an odd-even pair.
	Spill entire need for new groups before spilling any solitary regs.
	Reg already counted against max_nongroups can't become part of a group.
	(new_spill_reg): Do bookkeeping associated with a new spill-reg.
	(n_spills): This var is now static, no longer passed as arg
	within the file.

	(reload_reg_class_lower): Handle all group-reloads before solitaries.
	(choose_reload_targets): therefore #if 0 the special code for
	finding solitary registers that aren't suitable for groups.
	But fix two bugs in it: braino deciding whether a reload
	is looking for 1 register (not a group).  Use CLASS_MAX_NREGS.
	Also braino deciding whether a spill reg can be in a group.
	Did not fix bug that it fails to test HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK,
	so it might split up an even-odd pair.

	* vax.md: Special patterns for 8 and 16-bit fields, to make
	move-insns (like the ones for the 68k).

	* tree.c (convert_to_integer): Pass truncation down thru COND_EXPR
	as through a binary operator.

	* typecheck.c (build_cond_expr): If unpromoted operand types match,
	don't promote them--let containing expression promote (just once).

Tue May 24 14:46:26 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	prevent inheritance of certain reloads.

	* reload.c (find_equiv_reg): Let OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P reject
	an equiv reg.  Needed for funny float regs on 80387.

	* cccp.c (do_ident): Define #ident as a no-op if IDENT_DIRECTIVE.
	Warn if pedantic.
	(do_sccs): Warn if pedantic.

	* fold-const.c (combine): Typo in MIN_EXPR, MAX_EXPR.

	* reload1.c (reload): Was counting insn_groups as total size of groups,
	not number of groups.
	A new spilled group counts against group-needs of superclasses.

	* parse.y (parmlist{,_or_identifiers}_1): In error case,
	return a tree list just as in the other cases.

Fri May 20 02:14:51 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* flow.c (propagate_block): Skipping back across libcall didn't happen
	due to failing to set PREV.

	* expr.c (emit_library_call): Code to increment and decrement
	current_args_size broke since emit_call_1 was changed to restore it.

	* combine.c (try_combine): When i1 or i2 auto-incs a reg, don't combine
	if i3 uses that reg.

	* config-hp9k3.h: #define bcopy, bcmp, bzero here.
	* conf-hp9k320.h: Delete file.

	* integrate.c: Don't include strings.h--no need.

	* stmt.c (expand_asm_operands): Don't make zero-length vectors.

	* loop.c (scan_loop): After a fcn call, maybe-trap insns can't move.
	The fcn call might exit and that would prevent the trap.

	* reload1.c (reload): Set reload_first_uid to next uid to be used.
	* reload.c (find_equiv_reg): Use reload_first_uid to ignore insns
	that are due to reloading--only if reload_reg_p is not 0 or 1.

Wed May 18 22:11:20 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* typecheck.c (build_unary_op): Don't complain about array

	Don't allow nonexplicit constants in lprd, multiply or truncate insns.
	Use reg_or_mem_operand for constraint in op1 of divide insns;
	a constant there causes regclass to screw up.
	Split alternative constraints on the bit-field insns to avoid
	out-of-range operands in exts, inss.  Some cases of extraction
	can be done faster via memory.

	* flow.c (mark_set_1): When adding a REG_DEAD note, inc reg_n_deaths.

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_type_def): Do nothing for {integer,char}_type_node.

	LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P and put them in memory if not.

	* local-alloc.c (combine_regs): Allow a reg to be tied to a qty
	if the reg's class is contained in the qty's class
	(as well as if the reg's class contains the qty's class as before).
	Rename qty_reg_class to qty_min_class and make it the smallest
	class of any reg tied to the qty.
	(reg_class_subset_p, reg_meets_class_p, update_qty_class):
	New subroutines to implement this.
	(local_alloc): Init reg_qty to -1 for pseudos not in cur. basic block.
	(reg_is_born): Abort if pseudo not in basic block has -2 in reg_qty.

	if `int' is less than a word.

	* stddef.h (size_t, ptrdiff_t): Both are now long.

Fri May 13 01:06:00 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at lucky-charms.ai.mit.edu)

	* emit-rtl.c (gen_lowpart): Handle non-lowpart subreg as arg.

	* final.c, symout.c: If not NO_DBX_FORMAT, include stab.h to get the
	N_... symbols.  Use their default definitions only if they're undef.

	* expr.c (expand_call) [no PUSH_ROUNDING]: Always set argblock
	if there are any stack-passed arguments.

	* typecheck.c (build_unary_op): Mark all increment-exprs volatile.

	* recog.c (reg_renumbered_fits_class_p): Delete private copy of
	reg_class_contents.

	* reload1.c (forget_old_reloads): Handle PARALLEL case by recursion.
	Explicit store into a spilled reg invalidates old reloaded contents;
	this can occur when we drop through into a basic block whose need was 0
	(and so whose local pseudos were not spilled).

	* gcc.c (main): If -v, print gcc's own version; also no error msg
	if no input files.

	* loop.c (may_trap_p): Mem ref to nonconstant address may trap.

	(build_binary_op_nodefault): Likewise for shortening shifts.

	* stmt.c (expand_end_case): Use type_for_size to get the type
	to convert the index to, since `int' is wrong if -mshort.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): Don't check PARM type for completeness.
	(grokparms): If fn definition, check all parm types for completeness.
	(store_parm_decls): Likewise.

	* typecheck.c (store_init): For invalid init, store error_mark_node.
	* varasm.c (assemble_variable): Ignore error_mark as an init.
	* stmt.c (expand_decl): If init is error_mark, init to 0 if possible.

	* tm-hp9k320.h: Define STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY.

	(grokdeclarator): Calling grokparms, say "not a definition" for the
	function declarators for arg or value types within a definition.

	* parse.y: Call get_parm_info.
	(parmlist_or_identifiers): If identifiers, make a tree_list
	like the one get_parm_info returns.

	* parse.y (yyerror): Use the arg as part of the error message.

	* decl.c (start_function): Give the RESULT_DECL type int rather
	than char or short.
	* typecheck.c (c_expand_return): Convert value from fn's return type
	to the RESULT_DECL's type.

	* Avoid generating dbx xrefs to enums, since dbx loses on them.

	This is done only for top-level types; problem remains for local ones.

	* decl.c (finish_decl): Do rest_of_decl_compilation for TYPE_DECLs.
	* toplev.c (rest_of_decl_compilation): Do dbxout_symbol for them.

	* decl.c (finish_function): Delete FILENAME and LINE args.

	* typecheck.c (digest_init): No pedantic warning for array="string".

Tue May  3 09:09:30 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* tm-isi68.h: Greatly simplified; now works only with GAS.

	* tm-m68k.h (EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY): now 16 (right on Sun, ISI and HP).

	skip final RETURN (found on the vax).

	* toplev.c (main): -Wall is equiv to all -W switches combined.

	* stmt.c (expand_decl, expand_end_bindings,
	expand_{start,end}_function).  The -noreg treatment of `register' vars
	is extended to vars used as addresses of vars in memory (varying-size
	structures).
	(use_variable): Emit USE for regs used in specified rtx.

	* cse.c (fold_cc0): Stack-frame addresses are always nonzero.
	(fold_rtx): 0200 bit in prev_insn_cc0 means only zeroness is known.

	* expr.c (expand_call): Merge duplicate code for structure_value_addr.

	* emit-rtl.c (restore_reg_data): Delete error check; it's legit for
	a pseudo reg to appear nowhere in the rtl.

Sat Apr 30 07:35:31 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* integrate.c (copy_rtx_and_substitute): Fix typo for arg_pointer_rtx.

	* decl.c (poplevel): Undo previous change with #if 0.

	* stmt.c: `struct nesting' now records the depth on the stack.

	each expand_end... uses macro POPSTACK to pop.
	This way, if a level isn't explicitly popped, it won't cause
	circular structure.

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_type): Replace with main variant only if incomplete.

	* typecheck.c (build_unary_op): Test of `pedantic' was backwards.

	* expr.c (STACK_BYTES): Typo in definition.

	others.  This way the copied LET_STMTs correspond to the copied NOTEs.

	* varasm.c (decode_rtx_const): For SYMBOL_REF, use string address
	not address of the rtx.  Library fns have only one copy of the name
	but many copies of the SYMBOL_REF.

	current_args_size.
	(emit_library_call, expand_call): Pass new arg; don't restore it here.

	* expmed.c (expand_shift): In extzv strategy, handle the operand
	predicates for operands 0, 1 and 3.  (Not needed for 2.)
	* vax.md: extzv pattern for SImode op1 must recognize general_operand
	since the pattern named "extzv" allows them.

Wed Apr 27 00:52:44 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c (emit_call_1): New arg NEXT_ARG_REG describes # regs

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator primarily): Cast all RID_... to (int) before
	using them in arithmetic.  Placates CC on Sequent.

	Use complete_array_type	on constructors for incomplete array types.

	* typecheck.c (digest_init, store_init_value,process_init_constructor):
	It's now TREE_STATIC, not TREE_ADDRESSABLE, that records that all elts
	in a CONSTRUCTOR are simple constants.
	(digest_init): A CONSTRUCTOR with non-null type is treated as ordinary
	expression, not as a braced initializer.
	Allow init of an array from an array-valued expr; warn if pedantic.

	* cccp.c (rescan): Comment start when -traditional was output as
	`/*'; should be nothing.

	don't lose any NOTEs when splicing.

	* flow.c (propagate-block): For CALL_INSN, clobber the call-used regs
	only after mark_set_regs is done; avoids confusion about lifespan
	of function value reg.

	* gcc.c: Pass -Wcomment to cpp.

	* cccp.c (main, rescan): If -Wcomment, warn if `/*' inside comment.

	* decl.c (duplicate_decls): Ignore `inline' decl following definition.

	* m68k.md (casesi): Split it up into subroutines, so insns emitted

	* integrate.c (expand_inline_function): Insn to copy a subroutine's
	return-value was being output twice, once incorrectly.

	* reload.c (find_equiv_reg): A stack-push insn does not invalidate
	an equiv for a goal in memory.

	out of memory if -fforce-mem.

	* print-tree.c (prtypeinfo): Some attributes were missing.

	* integrate.c: `pushlevel' arg was missing.

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_type): Undo rest of March 29 change:
	When a named type is first seen inside another type, output an xref
	and let the real definition come out later.
	It is strange that Sun dbx has sometimes appeared to demand
	one strategy and sometimes appeared to demand the other.

	* typecheck.c (convert_for_assignment): Allow conversion to or from
	`const void *', etc., unless pedantic.

	* decl.c (get_parm_types): For `foo (void){}', set last_function_parms

	Record each arg's offset during first loop and don't change args_size
	during the actual pushing loop; this way the actual pushing loop
	works regardless of arg-order if arg-block was pushed in advance.
	(push_block): Copy SIZE to reg unless it's a reg or constant.

	* expmed.c (expand_divmod): If converting CEIL_DIV to FLOOR_DIV,
	make new pseudo for incremented value, to help cse understand.

Sun Apr 10 00:07:45 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c (emit_library_call): Two dumb bugs calling emit_call_1.

Sat Apr  9 21:26:51 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* decl.c (get_parm_types): `void' type is error, except as entire list.
	* parse.y (parmlist_1): `void,...' is error.

	* typecheck.c (pointer_int_sum, pointer_diff):
	Use an integer type with at least POINTER_SIZE bits.
	* expr.c (expand_expr, ARRAY_REF): Likewise.
	* tree.c (type_precision): Prec of a pointer is POINTER_SIZE.
	(convert_to_pointer): Directly convert any int w/ width==POINTER_SIZE.
	Other int types convert via an int of that width.
	(convert_to_integer): Pointers convert via an int of that width.

	* decl.c (init_decl_processing): Use INT_TYPE_SIZE, if def,
	to set width of `int' and `unsigned int'.
	(make_index_type): Give new type the width of a long int.

	* tm-m68k.h: Add new -mshort which controls TARGET_SHORT.
	* tm-m68k.h: Define INT_TYPE_SIZE depending on TARGET_SHORT.

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_tags): Output each tag once even if type is defined.

	* m68k.md (movstrictqi): Reject addr-reg always, for both operands.

	* tm-vax.h (STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY): Make this always 8, for BSD.
	* tm-ultrix.h: New file, overriding STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY.
	[This change has been taken out; tm-ultrix.h is now equivalent to
	tm-vax.h.  I must have been confused when testing PCC.]

	* integrate.c (expand_inline_function): Don't let inline_target
	be nonzero in BLKmode.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): Const array parm becomes ptr-to-const.

Thu Apr  7 05:02:41 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* genoutput.c (bcopy, bzero): Renamed to mybcopy, mybzero
	so variation in C library and config.h won't affect the results.
	* genrecog.c (bzero): likewise.
	* genextract.c (bcopy): Fn deleted; used only in a string constant. 

	* varasm.c (force_const_mem): Fix typo in arg decl.

	* toplev.c (compile_file): init_file with main_input_filename
	so dbx output doesn't lack N_SOL symbols.

Wed Apr  6 14:06:38 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c: Delete SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND conditionals added March 3.

	* m68k.md: Define casesi insn rather than tablejump insn.

	* cccp.c (skip_if_group): For validate_else, pass BP (end of cmd name).
	Don't call validate_else if do_else or do_endif will detect error.

	* Bug: inline fcns can refer to the return reg with a strict_low_part
	which confuses expand_inline_function.  Fix is to change return reg
	into inline_target *everywhere* except in or right after a call.
	* integrate.c (copy_rtx_and_substitute): Delete special case for SET.
	Replace return-value hard regs with INLINE_TARGET in all contexts.
	(expand_inline_function): special handling for insn after a CALL_INSN
	if it copies the function value out.
	Allow notes and stack adjust insns to intervene
	between the CALL_INSN and the value-copy.

	* expr.c (emit_call_1): New name for gen_call_1.

	* Bug: ({...}) insns were in wrong place for a subexpression
	after a sequence point, as in x ? y : ({...}).
	* tree.def: New tree-code RTL_EXPR holds a sequence.
	* expr.c (expand_expr): Handle RTL_EXPR by emitting the sequence.

	* parse.y (yylex): Handle syntax L"..." and L'...'
	(combine_strings): Handle wide strings being combined.
	* typecheck.c (digest_init): Reject wide string as init for char array.
	Allow it for an int array, but don't allow a narrow string.
	* decl.c (init_decl_processing): New var int_array_type_node.

	* parse.y: Define keyword `noalias'.
	* parse.h: Define RID_NOALIAS.

	* typecheck.c (compparms): Not all parmlists match an empty one;
	call `compparms1' to filter them.

	* decl.c (groktypename): Remove special case for `void' as parameter.
	(get_parm_types): Special case for list of one decl with type void.

	* decl.c (build_enumerator): Give enum constants the type `int'.

	since the precision has not changed.
	* stor-layout.c (layout_type): Allow enum types to be unsigned.

	* emit-rtl.c (unshare_all_rtl): Unshare contents of all reg-notes.

	eval the nonconstant arg anyway if it has side effects.
	(build_conditional_expr): When merging `foo *' with `void *',
	also allow `const void *'.  Result type has merged set of qualifiers.
	(qualify_type): Merge qualifiers of two types.

	* decl.c (get_parm_types): Store any tags defined in parmlist
	into `last_function_parm_types'.
	(store_parm_decls): Add those tags into the current binding level.

	* parse.y (parmlist, parmlist_or_identifier): Pass 0 to pushlevel;
	no binding levels in C should be transparent to tags.

	* 3b1 support:
	* tm-3b1.h: New file.

	* m68k.md: Add HPUX_ASM conditionals for shift-by-24-and-compare.
	In one of the dbra patterns, a HPUX_ASM conditional was backwards.
	(movhi) [SGS_3B1]: Define the LI... label as in MIT syntax.
	(addsi3) [SGS]: Syntax for base-displacement differs from MOTOROLA.
	(subsi3) [SGS]: likewise.
	(tablejump) [ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL]: Use 6, not 2, as displacement.
	This assumes ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL on 68k is used for a `swbeg'.

	* final.c (final): Use ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (if defined) to output
	any CODE_LABEL followed by an ADDR_VEC or ADDR_DIFF_VEC.
	It has 4 args; 4th is the insn which is the ADDR_VEC or ADDR_DIFF_VEC.

	* tm-*.h for 68000 (PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS): For unscaled indexing in
	fetch from a branch table, use L and LI symbols as in the scaled case.

	* cccp.c: If SCCS_DIRECTIVE, define #sccs as no-op.

	* integrate.c (output_inline_function): Real start of function
	is FIRST_PARM_INSN, not FIRST_FUNCTION_INSN.

	* tree.c (build_string): String contents must be saveable (for
	inline fcn).

	* cse.c (cse_insn): Don't forget to set dest_hash_code when dest
	is a stack slot (and so its address is not being optimized).

	* emit-rtl.c (restore_reg_data_1): reg_rtx_no must be 1+ largest REGNO.

	* m68k.md (non-SImode bit-field insns): Change constraint to "o,d"
	so a nonoffsetable memref is handled by reloading its address
	but a register can still be handled.

	* toplev.c (main): Execute OVERRIDE_OPTIONS, if it's defined.

Sat Apr  2 00:55:21 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c (convert_move): Handle a SUBREG in direct truncation case.

	* cse.c (lookup_for_remove): Don't test machine mode of registers:
	Storing in (REG:SI 0) invalidates (REG:DF 0).

	* decl.c (pushlevel): New arg, nonzero means this level is for
	variables only, not for tags.  All calls changed.
	(lookup_tag): Even if THIS_LEVEL_ONLY, skip variables-only levels.
	(pushtag): Define it in the first non-variables-only level.

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_type): Undo Mar 29 change, in the DBX_NO_XREFS case.
	So now each struct or union will contain only nameless cross-refs
	to any others it uses.  The prior change is still in effect when
	DBX_NO_XREFS is not defined.

	* Implement variable array bounds for parameters.
	* decl.c (poplevel): Don't crash if DECL_NAME gives 0.
	* typecheck.c (comptypes): A variable array bound matches anything.
	* parse.y (parmlist): Call pushlevel, then pushdecl each parm as it
	is parsed; then poplevel after using get_parm_types to extract the
	results of the parmlist.
	* decl.c (get_parm_types): New function; reverse the current decls,
	put them in last_function_parms, and return a list of their types.
	(grokparms): Arg is now an idlist or a typelist.  Do nothing if latter.
	(push_parm_decl): New function, like {start,finish}_decl combined
	for a parm in a parmlist.

	* dbxout.c (dbxout_symbol): Ignore sym if its DECL_RTL is 0.

	* symout.c (symout_block_symbols): Ignore sym if type is error_mark.

Fri Apr  1 11:41:21 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	for function and context, copy the context to the right hard reg,
	put the function address in the right place and return an rtx for it.
	(gen_call_1): No longer do those things.  Delete args CONTEXT, PROTECT.
	(emit_library_call, expand_call): Call `prepare_call_address'.
	In between that and `gen_call_1', USE the parm registers.

	* tm-hp9k320.h (ASM_OUTPUT_*): Flush uses of output_arith_constant.

	* varasm.c (assemble_variable): Use ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME
	to make the name for a local static variable.
	* tm-m68k.h, tm-vax.h, tm-ns32k.h, tm-spur.h:
	Define ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME.  Use `.', not `$', to separate.

	* tm-m68k.h, tm-ns32k.h (FIX_FRAME_POINTER_ADDRESS):
	To refer to stack ptr, use stack_pointer_rtx, not a copy.

	* tree.c (build_real_from_string): Function deleted.
	* parse.y (yylex): Use build_real and atof.

	* parse.y: Allow string concatenation in arg of asm.

	* parse.y (yylex): Always allow `$' in ident, but warn if pedantic.
	* tm-vms.h: Delete DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS (no longer tested).

	* cccp.c (rescan, do_define, initialize_random_junk):
	Always allow `$', but warn if pedantic.
	(main): If -t, set `traditional'.
	(collect_expansion): If `traditional', no special handling for quotes
	and no whitespace added at end of macro definition.

	* expr.c (compare, compare1): Last arg to compare_constants
	must be a size in bits.

Thu Mar 31 00:31:52 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* expmed.c (expand_mult, expand_divmod, extract_fixed_bit_field):
	Reject function return register as target if may need to read it.
	(Reading the return register in an inline function doesn't work.)

	* decl.c (start_function): Delete extra arg to `error'.

	* emit-rtl.c (last_parm_insn): Delete this unused var.

	* make-cc1.com: New version from Kashtan.

	* integrate.c (expand_inline_function): Always set up an INLINE_TARGET
	for a function that returns a nonvoid nonBLK value.
	Since `pushlevel' and `poplevel' are called, must also call
	`expand_{start,end}_bindings' to make a pair of NOTEs.
	Let them handle USEs at end of scope of formal parameter copies.

	* integrate.c (expand_inline_function): In a new-style CALL_INSN,
	don't change the result reg into INLINE_TARGET.  Also,
	generate a move insn after the call only if INLINE_TARGET is non-0.

	* integrate.c (copy_decl_tree): Don't crash if DECL_RTL is 0.

	* integrate.c (copy_for_inline): Don't treat `return' rtx's specially.

	* stmt.c (expand_{start,end,emit}_delayed_expr):
	New fns to handle ({...})'s in expressions output not where parsed
	(such as third expression in a `for' statement).

	function value hard reg.
	(wipe_dead_reg): If hard reg, call reg_is_born so that the death
	will not be ignored.
	(reg_is_set): For reg that dies in this insn, mark it dead from now on
	and post_mark it live after this insn only.

	* combine.c (try_combine): Don't allow a call insn as I1 or I2.

	* loop.c (count_loop_regs_set): Move CALL_INSN into a separate
	clause.  When finding regs that are function addresses, handle
	both old and new format call insns.

	* flow.c (insn_dead_p): A SET that contains a CALL can't be dead.
	(volatile_refs_p): Any CALL constitutes a volatile ref.
	(mark_used_regs): If setting a reg from a volatile ref,
	treat it like setting a reg whose value will be used.

	* expr.c (gen_call_1): New arg VALREG if nonzero means generate
	a call_value insn which stores in VALREG.
	(expand_call): Use `hard_function_value' to make the VALREG arg
	unless expression has type `void'.

	* expr.c (emit_library_call): New 2nd arg OUTMODE is mode of result.
	(So can give gen_call_1 the proper value-register.)
	All callers (here and optabs.c) pass this arg.

	* cse.c (canon_hash): Consider all CALL rtx's volatile.

	** end of change in representation of call insns.

	* stmt.c (expand_asm_operands): Replace complex lvalues with

	* typecheck.c (convert_for_assignment): Don't warn about
	pointers volatile * vs nonvolatile * if -fvolatile specified.

	* decl.c (store_parm_decls): Among the old-style parm decls
	there can legitiately be other decls!  For example, if a parm
	is declared `enum {foo, bar} x;', there are decls for `foo' and `bar'.
	Don't let anything but a PARM_DECL match a parm name;
	pass all the other decls through into the lexical context.

	jump-to-return, don't be fooled by intervening NOTEs.

	* tm-sequent.h (PRINT_OPERAND): Output (MEM (MEM (REG))) properly.
	* output-ns32k.c (print_operand_address): Output (MEM (REG))
	properly; output stack-pointer as `tos'.

	* flow.c (find_use_as_address): Reject uses within operand 0
	of a ZERO_EXTRACT or SIGN_EXTRACT reference.  It's hard to reload
	an autoincrement inside these because they can refer to multiple bytes.

	* reload.c (find_reloads): `o' in constraint means any memref
	(except auto-increment) is acceptable with reloading.
	Braino: Clear BADOP, not BAD.

	* reload.c (push_reloads): Use rtx_equal_p (via macro MATCHES)
	when considering reuse of an old reload.  Otherwise equal values
	may get reloaded into different registers, and two MEMs that
	originally matched may fail to match once reloaded.

	* m68k.md (sign_extract and zero_extract insns):
	If operand 0 is QI or HImode, don't allow register--only `o'
	(except in some bftst patterns where bitpos is < 8).

	(insert): Initialize it.
	(cse_insn): Set it to 1 when src_eqv is inserted.
	When finding cheapest equivalent of something,
	skip elts that are marked with `equivalence_only'.

	* decl.c (duplicate_decls): Don't call `layout_type'
	if the type is `error_mark_node'.

	* decl.c (implicitly_declare): If decl will be file-scope,

	* expr.c (expand_increment): A SUBREG in op0 can also a be a copy.

	* ns32k.md: Correct range of args for `adjspb' insn.
	Use `adjspw' when appropriate.
	New pattern for `lprd' insn.
	Change some `const_int' predicates to GET_CODE tests.

	* expr.c (expand_call): Eval function before copying args to hard regs.

	* tree.c (make_node, copy_node): Don't get length of a REAL_CST
	from tree_code_length.

	if tm.h parms say word could fail to be well-aligned.
	* tm-ns32k.h: Define STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY so they will be aligned.
	* tm-vax.h: Define STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY since Unix CC seems to.

	* tm-vms.h (CPP_PREDEFINES): Predefine __GNU__ and __GNUC__.

Tue Mar 22 15:45:10 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c (expand_increment): Flush special case for register_operand;
	actually call the predicate whatever it is.

	* genemit.c (gen_expand): Make `operands' a local variable,
	not a global static one, in the `gen_...' function.
	Avoids lossage when one `gen_...' fcn calls another indirectly.

	* recog.c (constrain_operands): Set global var `which_alternative'
	to indicate which of the alternatives this insn matches.

	* typecheck.c (commontype): long int vs unsigned int
	gives long unsigned, if long and int are the same width.

	* gcc.c: Handle -fnostdinc and -fnostdlib switches in specs.

	* cccp.c (main): Handle -fnostdinc: don't put default dirs
	on the chain to be searched.

	* cccp.c (error, warning, error_with_line): No longer print
	charpos within file; lineno is enough.

Wed Mar 16 16:56:36 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* expmed.c (expand_inc, expand_dec): Handy new subroutines
	to generate x+=y or x-=y, given x and y as rtl.
	* expmed.c (expand_divmod): Use them instead of gen_{add2,sub2}_insn.

	* expr.c (emit_move_insn): Return the move insn emitted.
	Eliminate the code here to move a DImode or DFmode by pieces.

	* emit-rtl.c (emit_insn): Return-value was wrong if emit_to_sequence;
	cannot use `last_insn' in that case.

	* regclass.c, stupid.c, local-alloc.c, global-alloc.c:
	Some vars of type HARD_REG_SET should be `register' only
	if HARD_REG_SET is a macro (ie a scalar).

	* expr.c (move_block_from_reg): New function, converse of
	move_block_from_reg.
	* stmt.c (assign_parms): If a BLKmode arrives in regs,
	copy to a stack slot using move_block_from_reg.

Tue Mar 15 17:33:22 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* regclass.c (regclass): Don't convert to two-operand insns
	unless optimizing.

	* varasm.c (decode_rtx_const, const_hash_rtx): Fix typos.

	* stmt.c (fixup_var_1): Don't alter insn moving VAR to or from
	a subreg of a register.

	* cse.c (fold_rtx): Don't fold if result is not LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P.
	Construct all results in new local variable NEW; then test that
	and decide whether to return it or the original rtx.

	* cse.c (cse_insn): When SRC_EQV is non-0 but set[0] has been
	cleared, don't insert SRC_EQV in hash table.

	* All insns emitted by a define_expand become part of the SEQUENCE:
	* SEQUENCE now contains a vector of insns, not of bodies.
	* insn-emit.c (add_insn): If `emit_to_sequence' nonzero, add the
	insn to a separate chain, `sequence_first_insn'.
	(gen_sequence): Take everything on that chain and make a SEQUENCE.
	(emit_insn): Handle SEQUENCE differently since elts are now insns.
	(emit_insn_{before,after}): Handle SEQUENCE.
	(classify_insn): #if 0.
	* genemit.c (gen_expand): emit all the insns, then call gen_sequence
	to make the return value.
	Define two macros DONE and FAIL for use in a DEFINE_EXPAND:
	Use DONE to inhibit emission of the pattern of the DEFINE_EXPAND.
	Use FAIL to make the gen_... function return 0.

Mon Mar 14 12:47:28 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* expr.c (expand_expr): Extend the don't-sign-extend-enums hack
	to COMPONENT_REF.  (See 3 March.)

	* tm-*.h (FUNCTION_ARG, etc.) New argument NAMED
	is nonzero for a named arg, zero for an anonymous extra arg.
	* expr.c (expand_call): Pass 1 for NAMED if appropriate.
	* expr.c (emit_library_call): Pass 1 for NAMED.
	* stmt.c (assign_parms): Pass 1 for NAMED.

	* cccp.c: Test __GNUC__, not __GNU__.

	* integrate.c (copy_and_substitute_rtx):
	Replacing a MEM parm with the parm value, convert mode if mismatch.
	Always use VOIDmode when generating SETs.
	Take heed of FIRST_PARM_OFFSET and distinguish arg-pointer
	from frame-pointer when they are different.
	(expand_inline_function): Handle (RETURN) insns, by creating a
	return_label which is output after the integrated code.

	* parse.y (yylex): Condition for ignoring `inline' was backwards.

	* flow.c (mark_used_regs): Ignore STRICT_LOW_PART, so that
	an insn that sets STRICT_LOW_PART (and its source values) may be dead.
	(propagate_block): Always pass 1 for strict_low_ok to insn_dead_p.

	* optabs.c (emit_unop_insn): Don't make a REG_RETVAL note.
	Change above deletes dead STRICT_LOW_PART stores without one.

	* optabs.c (expand_binop, expand_unop): If the library address
	is to be put in a pseudoreg, do it here, and make the REG_RETVAL
	note point after that.

	* expr.c (emit_library_call): Never defer stack-pops.
	Deletion of the library call by flow.c loses if they are deferred.

	* cse.c (cse_insn): Handling of 68k's zero-extend was broken:
	it made the actual source and the REG_EQUAL source equivalent.
	* If dest is a STRICT_LOW_PART, ignore the actual source and use
	the REG_EQUAL source in its place.  src_eqv's mode may be different
	from src's, so use proper mode in lookups or inserts for src_eqv.
	* Don't forget to set src_eqv_elt if src_eqv already has an elt.
	* On use_related_value for src_eqv, use src_eqv_elt.

	* toplev.c (main_input_filename): Name of file mentioned in first
	#-line in the input.
	(compile_file): Pass it to dbxout_init as 2nd arg.

	* parse.y (check_newline): Store main_input_filename.

	* expr.c (move_block_to_reg): New function, copies a MEM:BLK
	to consecutive registers.
	(use_regs): New function to emit a USE for each reg in a series.
	(expand_call): Use the two new functions when a precomputed BLKmode
	arg is passed entirely in regs.
	(emit_push_insn): Use move_block_to_reg when PARTIAL > 0.
	Also, don't subtract USED from SIZE twice.
	Use plus_constant to add ARGS_SO_FAR so can use indexing on stack ptr.

	* varasm.c (assemble_integer_zero): Use rtx 0, not tree 0,
	to go with prev change in ASM_OUTPUT_INT.

Sun Mar 13 01:16:17 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* varasm.c (const_hash, compare_constant_1, record_constant_1):
	Handle NOP_EXPR and CONVERT_EXPR in constant expressions.

	* optabs.c (expand_binop, expand_unop): When widening operands,
	those with VOIDmode (like CONST_INT) may be left alone.

Sat Mar 12 01:09:24 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* varasm.c (assemble_variable): When making a .comm or .lcomm,
	round size up to multiple of BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT.

	* obstack.c (_obstack_newchunk): Eliminate fencepost causing copying
	to access the word past the end of the existing object.

	* tm-vax.h, tm-ns32k.h: Define {INIT_,}CUMULATIVE_ARGS
	and upgrade FUNCTION_ARGS for new calling convention.

	* gcc.c: If -O, define __OPTIMIZE__.
	(do_spec_1): %c now scans SIGNED_CHAR_SPEC: define __CHAR_UNSIGNED__
	when appropriate whether or not it is the default.

	* parse.y: Define YYDEBUG.

	* rtl.c (rtx_unstable_p): New function, same as old rtx_varies_p.
	* explow.c (stabilize): Use rtx_unstable_p.
	* rtl.c (rtx_varies_p): Ignore `unchanging' (undoing previous change
	in this function) because `unchanging' doesn't enable cse to compare
	the value with any particular constant value.
	* rtl.c (insn_store_addr_varies_p): Delete, since not used.

	* hard-reg-set.h (COPY_HARD_REG_SET, etc.) non-scalar case:
	Rename and rearrange temp variables to avoid name conflicts with args.

	* regclass.c (reg_class_record): Don't smash class to GENERAL_REGS
	and don't exit prematurely, when `r' or `g' is seen.  Must merge
	GENERAL_REGS with previously determined desired class.

	* expr.c (expand_call) [no PUSH_ROUNDING]: When pushing the arg
	block, try to reuse some of the pending_stack_adjust.

	* cse.c: qty_const can now hold values (PLUS frame_pointer integer).
	Effect is that storing into a structure doesn't invalidate
	mem refs to scalar stack variables via addresses in registers.
	(insert): Load such values into qty_const, like true constants.
	(fold_rtx): Ignore qty_const if it isn't really a constant.

	* expr.c (expand_expr) VAR_DECL: Copy DECL_RTL before calling
	change_address, so it isn't permanently clobbered.

	* stmt.c (fixup_var_refs_1): Make sure the stack slot address
	is valid by calling fixup_stack_1 each time it is substituted.

	* stmt.c (fixup_stack_1): Return the altered rtx.
	If it's a MEM in the stack, return a copy of it.

	* stmt.c (fixup_stack_slots): #if 0.
	* stmt.c (expand_finish_function): Don't call fixup_stack_slots
	because fixup_stack_1 is called elsewhere when necessary.

	* reload.c (find_reloads_address): New arg is location of the MEM
	whose address is being reloaded.  So we copy the MEM if it
	is one that can be shared.  New arg 0 means no need to copy the MEM.
	All callers pass the new arg.

	* stmt.c (assign_parms): Determine parm stack-size from
	the DECL_ARG_TYPE, not from the TREE_TYPE.
	Else loses when parm is declared `float' but passed as `double'.

	* emit-rtl.c (make_safe_from): Constants are already safe.
	Use proper machine mode for temp reg when needed.

	* expr.c (emit_push_insn): Don't pass wrong type to plus_constant
	(case where there is no PUSH_ROUNDING).

	* expr.c (expand_call): Round partial[i] down to multiple of
	PARM_BOUNDARY before subtracting it from arg size on stack.
	Compute these sizes just once and keep them in vector `arg_size'.
	* expr.c (emit_push_insn): Handle `partial' uniformly, in accord
	with this new convention for how it affects the stack size.
	* stmt.c (assign_parms): Round NREGS down to PARM_BOUNDARY likewise.

	* obstack.h (obstack_free macro) [Not __GNUC__ but __STDC__]:
	Don't cast result of (obstack_free) to (int); just ignore it.

	* reload.c (find_reloads): Initialize operand_reloadnum.

	* optabs.c (emit_unop_insn): New argument CODE, used to make
	a REG_EQUAL note from operand OP0 if more than one insn results.
	Also a REG_RETVAL note.
	* expr.c (convert_move): Pass CODE arg to emit_unop_insn.
	* flow.c (propagate_block): Use insn_dead_p to decide whether
	to handle a REG_RETVAL note by skipping some insns.
	Always pass 1 for STRICT_LOW_OK for an insn that has a REG_RETVAL note.
	Handle case where REG_RETVAL points at an insn that's deleted.
	* flow.c (insn_dead_p): New operand STRICT_LOW_OK says an insn
	that sets STRICT_LOW_PART may be considered dead.

	* expr.c (expand_expr): Once again canonicalize X-C to X+(-C).
	Change on March 1 made it stop doing this.

Wed Mar  9 01:25:35 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* loop.c (move_movables): Don't always mark the moved reg
	as equivalent to a constant value: not if it is being cleared
	to zero-extend something or if it is used outside the loop.

	* expr.c (move_by_pieces_1): Finish last change.

	* stmt.c (assign_parms): Update stack_args_size properly.
	Figure FIRST_PARM_OFFSET when making the stack mem refs.

	* cse.c (insert): Build the related_value lists in the opposite order
	so that the oldest element in the chain is the one that follows
	the most basic element.

	* expr.c (expand_expr): COMPONENT_REF case: criterion for
	converting the the result is if MODE1 (its mode of arrival) isn't
	a mode we want.

	* toplev.c (rest_of_compilation): Fix typo setting TREE_ASM_WRITTEN.

Tue Mar  8 13:18:37 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at wheaties.ai.mit.edu)

	* cse'ing of library calls.

	* expr.h: type `optab' is now a ptr to a struct.
	The old contents are now the `handlers' element.
	The `code' element gives the RTL code for the kind of expression
	this optab makes (PLUS for add_optab, etc.)
	Every var formerly declared `struct optab *' is now just `optab'.

	* optabs.c (init_optab, init_optabs): New function to init an optab
	and set its `code'.  Used in init_optabs.

	* optabs.c (expand_binop, expand_unop): Use the `code' field
	to add a REG_EQUAL note to the insn that copies a libcall's

	first insn for setting up args for the call.

	* cse.c (cse_insn): Process REG_EQUIV and REG_EQUAL datum almost like
	another set-src; put the actual src into the equivalence class of that.

	COMPONENT_REF and ..._DECL.

	* varasm.c (output_arith_constant): Function deleted.
	* tm-*.h: (ASM_OUTPUT_{INT,SHORT,CHAR}): 2nd arg is now an RTX

	for a new function.  Called from `expand_function_start'.

	For constant operands, use LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P to decide value.
	* tm-*.h: Define LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P.

	* reload.c (push_reloads): If IN occurs within OUT,
	don't reuse an existing input-only reload.  Otherwise would lose on
	(set (mem (plus R C)) (plus R C1)) if R is available in a spill reg.

	* reload1.c (choose_reload_targets): Don't choose an inherited
	reload register that's in use for another reload.

	Use PARM_BOUNDARY when counting it; derive stack offsets from it.
	Set current_function_args_size from it.

	When an arg is split between regs and stack, make stack space
	for the rest of it, and count it.
	In a varargs function, push the last arg onto the stack.
	When an arg is passed in regs alone, don't remember a stack slot
	for it, and if it needs one, use assign_stack_local.

	Set DECL_OFFSET to the stack offset, or -1 if parm came in regs.

	* optabs.c (emit_unop_insn): Generate and emit an insn
	given the insn-code and the two operands (one out, one in).

	* expr.c (convert_move): Use emit_unop_insn for outputting the
	conversion insns.

	assembler code in this case, but it makes the dbx output correct.

	* recog.c (constrain_operands): When operands_match_p returns 2,
	in the constraint alternative that is ultimately successful,
	copy the output operand from the input that it matched
	so that the assembler insn that is output shows the pre-increment.

	group, or else one that has only one available neighbor.

	* reload1.c (reload): Find separately the max need for each class
	for single registers, groups of registers, and single registers
	not in any group.  (The last one counts non-group reloads
	in insns that have at least one group reload.)
	Then make sure enough of each kind are found.

	* expmed.c: Now needs flags.h and recog.h (therefore insn-config.h).

	* expmed.c (store_bit_field):
	Delete redundant protect_from_queue.

	If insv's predicate for VALUE wants a register, put it there.

	zero-extending clr insn; don't make the reg invariant when it's moved.

	* optabs.c (expand_unop, expand_binop, emit_cmp_insn):
	mode-argument to predicates was missing.

	* optabs.c (expand_binop): If gen-function returns 0, this means
	the insn wasn't available.

	* reload.c (find_reloads): Don't make optional reloads for operands
	that match other operands.

	* reload.c (combine_reloads): Reject optional output reload.

	* typecheck.c (build_function_call): Typo in validating
	data type of function.

	* genoutput.c (gen_expand): Must create a `struct data' even

	* loop.c (scan_loop): Replace the code for handling zero-extends
	with unconditional code that checks for a pair of insns.

	* m68k.md: Do zero-extend using define_expand to generate

	since there are special insn patterns for them.
	Resubroutinize and add temp vars to make expressions smaller.
	* ns32k.md: Add a few more special stack insns; now there are enough.

	* tm-sequent.h: Definitions of DBX_NO_XREFS and DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH.

	* reload1.c (choose_reload_targets): Handling of reload_strict_low
	is needed for input reloads as well as output, since a strict_low_part
	operand is normally a read-write operand.

	* reload1.c (reload): The mode a reload needs is the wider of
	the input and output modes--just as it is in choose_reload_targets.

	* reload.c (find_dummy_reload): If IN and OUT have different widths
	and one of them exceeds a word, don't find any dummy reload.

	* toplev.c (compile_file): Allocate enough space for .jump2 filename.

Sat Jan 30 10:35:46 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* output-ns32k.c (print_operand_address):
	Print addresses of the form C1+(N*REG+C2) which currently
	are accepted as legitimate memory addresses.

	* tm-sequent.h: Simple bugs in PRINT_OPERAND, TARGET_DEFAULT
	and SEQUENT_ADDRESS_BUG.

	* gen*.c: Must explicitly exit; returning from `main' fails
	to indicate nonzero status due to bug in Unix.

	* parse.y (check_line_number): Ignore entire line of unrecognized
	#-directive; no error if it is `pragma'.

Fri Jan 29 06:46:01 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* genrecog.c, genextract.c, genoutput.c: Define bcopy and/or bzero.

	* cccp.c (do_define): Make defn->argnames long enough in no-args case.

	* reload1.c (reload): Make basic_block_needs 0 until after the
	frame pointer reg is spilled, so that ALL pseudos in it are spilled.

	* typecheck.c (truthvalue_conversion):
	Strip a NOP_EXPR only if it extends, not if it truncates.
	(build_unary_op): For TRUTH_NOT_EXPR, call invert_truthvalue
	to simplify.

	* Fixes for HPUX support from cph:
	* tm-hp9k320.h: Correct names of floating-point registers.
	Fix typos in ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE; also convert `fmove' to `fmov'.
	* Makefile (comments for HPUX):
	cph says -Wd,-X isn't needed in CFLAGS, nor -lBSD in CLIB.
	Also that -g can't be used in CFLAGS with HP's pcc.
	* conf-hp9k320.h: New file, like config-m68k.h but with
	#defines for the bstring functions.
	* m68k.md: Add else-clauses to the HPUX_ASM conditionals on cmp insns.
	Reinsert mistakenly-deleted MOTOROLA conditionals around
	some OUTPUT_JUMPs.

Thu Jan 28 09:51:41 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* jump.c (jump_back_p): If TARGET is unconditional, return 0.

Wed Jan 27 04:18:29 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* combine.c (subst): Simplify (plus (plus x c1) c2).

	* expr.c (emit_push_insn): Don't use small-block push-insns for BLKmode
	when one of them would be affected by PUSH_ROUNDING.
	Instead, make all the space and then copy.
	* expr.c (expand_call): Don't apply PUSH_ROUNDING if BLKmode.

	* Allow `asm' with operands to be marked volatile.
	* cse.c (canon_hash): Don't record ASM_OPERANDS that has `volatil'.
	* loop.c (invariant_p): ASM_OPERANDS with `volatil' can't be invariant.
	* flow.c (volatile_refs_p): Note ASM_OPERANDS that are volatile.
	* stmt.c (expand_asm_operands): New arg VOL; mark ASM_OPERANDS as vol.
	* typecheck.c (c_expand_asm_operands): New arg VOL.
	* parse.y: allow a TYPE_QUAL after ASM.

	* Make cse handle `asm' with operands:
	* cse.c (canon_hash): Hash string operands by contents, not address.
	* cse.c (exp_equiv_p): Compare string operands with strcmp.
	* rtl.c (rtx_equal_p): Compare string operands with strcmp.

	* decl.c (init_decl_processing): Once sizetype is set,
	correct the type of the sizes of types already made.

	* cccp.c (do_defines): Don't reject #define foo{a}.

Tue Jan 26 04:53:16 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* reload.c (find_reloads): Now that `asm' is limited to
	MAX_RECOG_OPERANDS, eliminate dynamic allocation of `constraints'
	and `constraints1', and go back to `recog_operand' instead of
	`operands'.

	* typecheck.c (c_expand_asm_operands): New fn to handle `asm' for C.
	Calls expand_asm_operands, and handles output operands that
	the other function cannot handle.

	* parse.y: Call that function.

	* stmt.c (expand_asm_operands): Error if too many operands.
	#include insn-config.h to get MAX_RECOG_OPERANDS.

	* expr.c (expand_assignment): Use store_field to handle
	structure fields and array elements.

	* output-m68k.c (output_move_double): PUSHOP and POPOP were swapped.
	Handle insns that push an sp-relative address onto sp;
	these can arise with -fomit-frame-pointer.
	BUG? Do unoffsetable mem refs using sp and fp lose?

	* m68k.md (movdi,movdf): Allow unoffsetable mem refs
	only if the other operand is a register.

	* m68k.md (zero_extendqisi2): SGS conditionals deleted.
	Supposedly the MOTOROLA syntax works for those addresses.

	* typecheck.c (default_conversion):
	If flag_traditional, preserve unsignedness when promoting ints,
	and promote float to double.

	* typecheck.c (build_binary_op_nodefault):
	Allow comparisons between pointers and ints.
	If not -traditional, warn about them.

Mon Jan 25 02:11:18 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* expmed.c ({extract,store}_split_bit_field):
	Functions {extract,store}_split_reg_bit_field now work for memory
	also, and therefore are renamed.
	* ({extract,store}_fixed_bit_field): Call those fns when a field
	is split across two words.
	Also, preserve the `volatil' bit on memory refs.

	* output-m68k.c (output_move_double): Handle nonoffsetable mem refs.
	* m68k.md: Relax constraints on movdi, movdf.

	* decl.c (init_decl_processing): Define `int' and `char' first.
	Set `sizetype' explicitly.

	* stmt.c (fixup_var_refs_1): May not just return when a SET
	doesn't have VAR as its src or dest.

	* varasm.c: Don't include c-tree.h.

	* decl.c (build_struct): Split this function into three:
	`xref_tag', `start_struct' and `finish_struct'.
	`xref_tag' subsumes `xref_enum'.

	* parse.y (structsp): When parsing `struct foo {...}', define the tag
	as a cross-ref before parsing the components.  Use the three new fns.

	* regclass.c (regclass): Recognize new-format ASM_OPERANDS insns
	with `asm_noperands', and scan their operands as usual.

	* cse.c: In numerous functions such as canon_hash, rtx_cost, etc.
	that do tree-walk on rtx, handle vectors of subexpressions.

	* loop.c (invariant_p): Likewise.

	* jump.c (delete_insn): Two bugs:
	If insn already deleted, return the first following nondeleted.
	Deleting a jump's label can delete NEXT.  Make sure return value
	is always the first insn following INSN and not yet deleted.

Sun Jan 24 02:27:49 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* rtl.def (ASM_OPERANDS): Change the rtl expression of an
	`asm' with operands so it looks like this for one output operand:
	(set OUTPUT (asm_operands:OUTPUTMODE INSNSTRING OUTPUTCONSTRAINT
					     0 INPUTS INPUTCONSTRAINTS)).
	and like this for multiple outputs:
	(PARALLEL [
	  (set OUTPUT0 (asm_operands:OUTPUTMODE INSNSTRING OUTPUTCONSTRAINT
					        0 INPUTS INPUTCONSTRAINTS)).
	  (set OUTPUT1 (asm_operands:OUTPUTMODE1 INSNSTRING OUTPUTCONSTRAINT1
					        1 INPUTS INPUTCONSTRAINTS))])

	* parse.y: Change parsing of `asm' to distinguish input and output
	operands.  Separate them with colon; separate the string with colon.

	* stmt.c (expand_asm_operands): Receive inputs and outputs separately.
	Generate the new rtl format.

	* recog.c (asm_noperands, decode_asm_operands): New fns
	for extracting the operands and constraints from these insns.

	* final.c (final): Recognize and output the new rtl format
	using those new functions.

	* reload.c (find_reloads): Recognize and get constraints
	from the new rtl format using those new functions.
	New variable `operand_modes' holds the machine modes of the
	operands, obtained one way for ASM_OPERANDS insns and another
	for other insns.

	* rtl.c (note_stores): Calling convention
	is changed: the first arg FUNCTION now receives as its 2nd arg
	1 if clobbering, 0 if setting.  Used to be the CLOBBER or SET rtx.

	* local-alloc.c (reg_is_set): This fn is called from note_stores;
	change its arguments.

	* tm-m68k.h (FIXUP_FRAME_POINTER_ADDRESSES):
	Use frame_pointer_rtx to recognize intended frame-pointer refs
	and not recognize pseudo-regs that were allocated to the frame
	pointer register.

	* emit-rtl.c: All refs to frame pointer use a single rtx, in
	frame_pointer_rtx.  Likewise arg_pointer_rtx for the arg pointer.
	If they are the same register, these are the same rtx.
	Initialize them in init_emit.
	* rtl.h: Declare these vars.

	* stmt.c (assign_parms, assign_stack_local): Use those rtx's.

Sat Jan 23 00:32:10 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes.ai.mit.edu)

	* reload.c (find_reloads): Don't combine_reloads if `&' constraint
	was used.

	* parse.y: Parse `asm' with operands.
	* stmt.c (expand_asm_params): New fn: generate an ASM_OPERANDS for
	`asm' with operands.
	* final.c (final): Output an ASM_OPERANDS insn-body.
	* regclass.c (regclass): Ignore ASM_OPERANDS, like ASM_INPUT.

	* reload.c (find_reloads): Handle reloading of ASM_OPERANDS.
	The number of operands can no longer be bounded.
	For example we can't always put the operands in recog_operands.

	New locals OPERANDS and OPERAND_LOCS point to alloca'd vectors of
	operands and their locations.  New locals CONSTRAINTS and CONSTRAINTS1
	hold alloca'd vectors of constraints.

	Unfortunately this isn't enough; every vector with length
	MAX_RECOG_OPERANDS needs to be dynamically allocated.
	Would this be too slow?  For now, a cheap "solution" is to delete
	any insn that has too many operands.

	* rtl.def: Delete VOLATILE, UNCHANGING and UNDESCRIBED.
	Add ASM_OPERANDS.

	* regclass.c (reg_class_record): Delete ref to UNCHANGING.
	* loop.c (invariant_p):
	* rtl.c (rtx_varies_p):

	* cccp.c: Define __VERSION__.

	* decl.c (shadow_tag): TYPE_NAME doesn't work to get the tag-name
	of a struct, so use new function lookup_tag_reverse.
	* decl.c (lookup_tag_reverse): Given a type, return its tag name.

	* symout.c (symout_source_file): Output one `struct source'.
	* symout.c (symout_lines): Output all of them, and the sourcevector.
	* gdbfiles.h: New file for communication between final.c and symout.c.

	* final.c (output_source_line): New arg WRITE_SYMBOLS says write
	new GDB-format linenumber info.  Assigns a filenum to each source
	file name and keeps track of the correspondence.

	* cccp.c (do_include): Output the -M info after searching the dirs;
	include the actual dir name.  Don't generate "./" for current dir.

Fri Jan 22 04:10:10 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* tm-news800.h: Delete override of INDIRECTABLE_1_ADDRESS.
	Output is faster if it doesn't use 32-bit displacements.

	* reload.c (combine_reloads): New function.
	If possible, find an input reload
	and an output reload that can be turned into one input-output reload.
	The old output-reload is marked as inoperative: reload_out
	and reload_in both zero.  This is called from find_reloads.

	* reload1.c (reload, choose_reload_targets): Ignore inoperative
	reloads.

	* Print warnings for variables that could be clobbered by `longjmp'.
	* expr.c (expand_call): Generate a NOTE_INSN_SETJMP whenever
	`setjmp' or `_setjmp' is called.
	* flow.c (propagate_block): When NOTE_INSN_SETJMP is seen,
	record the live regs in `regs_live_at_setjmp'.
	* stmt.c (uninitialized_vars_warning): Warn about vars that have regs
	that are set more than once and are marked in `regs_live_at_setjmp'.
	Works through function `regno_clobbered_by_longjmp'.
	* rtl.h: Define NOTE_INSN_SETJMP.

	* genrecog.c (try_merge_2): When enforce_modes, keep all the
	alternatives segregated by modes and keep the modes in numerical order.
	* genrecog.c (write_tree): Make conditions for switch-on-modes
	know what difference enforce_mode makes.

Thu Jan 21 00:12:35 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* tm-ns32k.h: Use Stein's definitions of PRINT_OPERAND{,_ADDRESS};
	move the Sequent definitions info tm-sequent.h.
	Handle %$ in both old and new PRINT_OPERAND.
	Define CPP_PREDEFINES.

	* ns32k.md: Merge some features from Jan Stein's port:
	strict_low_part insns, smart output of booleans with small
	constant args, acbd insns generalized for other increments.
	Use %$ wherever there is an explicit immediate.
	Fix shortcomings of adjsp insns: use adjspd in general,
	and use adjspb in all the cases that allow it.
	Don't bother explicitly clearing CC_REVERSED.
	For tstsf/tstdf, output the floating-zero constants
	using {f,d}const0_rtx.

	A problem still remains, which is that the Sequent and the
	other ns32k assembler syntax require different 

	* typecheck.c (unary_complex_value): Use correct datatype for
	compound-exprs.

	* gen*.c (main): Use obstack_init instead of obstack_begin.

	* vax.md: define_peephole for  andl3 x,y,z; extzv z,....,z

	* m68k.md (tstsi): Use cmpw instead of cmpl to test addr reg.

	* tm-m68k.h: Bugs for 68000 when frame size is over 64k.
	For FUNCTION_PROLOGUE, just subtract from sp instead of fp.
	For FUNCTION_EPILOGUE, must put the size into a0 and then
	all insns must be indexed by a0.  And do this even on 68020.

	* tm-isi68.h: Similar changes.
	* tm-news800.h, tm-hp9k320.h: Similar changes.

Wed Jan 20 04:38:21 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* cccp.c (error_with_line): New function.
	Use it to report the "unterminated whatever" errors.

	* typecheck.c (build_unary_op): Recursive call had missing arg.

	* m68k.md (movhi): If MOTOROLA, the insn that fetches from a
	case-dispatch table now defines the LI label as .+2.
	* tm-news800.el, tm-hp9k320.h (PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS):
	Don't subtract 2 when outputting the address in that insn.

Tue Jan 19 00:02:33 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* stmt.c (fixup_var_ref_1): Use that fn for operands of
	SIGN_EXTRACT and ZERO_EXTRACT, since (SUBREG:SI (REG:QI...))
	could have turned into (SUBREG:SI (MEM:QI...)), which is unsafe.

	* rtl.c (debug_rtx): Print an rtx on stderr, for debugging.

Sun Jan 17 04:37:20 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* gcc.c: options -M* treated like -M.

	* stmt.c (pushcase): Do nothing if the case index has error_mark type.

	* expr.c (expand_increment): Don't use queue for post-inc on memory
	if the add insn requires register args.  (Better code for RISCs.)

Sat Jan 16 02:10:22 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* ns32k.md: Change register_operand to general_operand.
	* ns32k.md (udivmoddisi4): Use match_dup where required.
	Comment it out because it can't accept two independent output args.

Fri Jan 15 00:02:35 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	* toplev.c: Include sys/time.h only for BSD.  For USG, use time.h.
	This is correct for HPUX; don't know about others.

	constant value of a qty.  When making a REG_WAS_0 note,
	store in it the insn that established the value 0.

	* vax.md (movsi): When checking a REG_WAS_0 note,
	verify that the insn it points to hasn't been deleted or made a NOTE.

Thu Jan 14 00:01:35 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at frosted-flakes)

	for each basic block that needs a reload.
	* reload1.c (spill_hard_reg): Don't spill pseudos that are
	confined to a basic block which has no need for any reloads.
	* reload1.c (reload): Each cycle that any element of basic_block_needs
	changes from 0 to 1, must re-spill all previously spilled regs.

	* regclass.c (record_address_regs):
	Skip the charging of ICOST if it is 0.

	* flags.h, toplev.c: New flag -fvolatile.
	* typecheck.c (build_indirect_ref): If flag_volatile,
	every INDIRECT_REF is marked with TREE_THIS_VOLATILE.

	* fold-const.c (fold): Test in TRUTH_NOT_EXPR case was backward.
	Also result type is always `int'.

Sat Jan  9 04:16:11 1988  Richard Stallman  (rms at rice-krispies)

	* flags.h (flag_traditional): New flag.
	* toplev.c: recognize -ftraditional and -traditional.

	structure size to multiple of EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY.

	* cse.c (make_regs_eqv): Was testing for reg_next_eqv[lastr] == 0
	and should be == -1.

	* reload1.c (reload_as_needed): Fix invalid optimization deleting
	the previous store into a pseudo-reg that feeds an input-reload.
	It is not safe because a later insn may look in the pseudo's stack
	slot for the value.  Delete the store only if we can eliminate the
	pseudo entirely or if the current insn stores a new value there.
	Also verify that reload_in[j] is a REG.

	* reload1.c (reload_as_needed): When doing an input reload from a
	pseudo that was stored by the previous insn (not as a reload),
	redirect the previous insn into the reload register, if this lets
	us eliminate the pseudo entirely.

	* reload1.c (reload_as_needed): In both of the above cases, it's
	impossible to prevent a stack slot since one was already assigned,
	so don't alter reg_n_refs.  Instead, set reg_renumber to record
	that this pseudo did get a hard reg.

	* stmt.c: Set `volatil' in pseudo-regs for the user's variables.

	* jump.c (delete_insn): Do nothing if insn already deleted.

	* tm-sun{2,3}.h: #define STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY 2
	for compatibility with Sun PCC.  Note that 4.3 vax PCC
	does not want this.

	* fold-const.c: Replace truncate_unsigned with force_fit_type
	which truncates unsigned types and sign-extends signed types.

	* expr.c (do_jump): emit_queue before outputting the jump insns
	that use the comparison.

	* stmt.c: Error message for any goto that jumps into a
	binding contour that restores a stack level.

	TREE_PACKED (label) means label was defined inside
	such a binding contour that is now exited.  Using such a label
	is an error.

	TREE_ADDRESSABLE (label) means label was used from a place
	outside all such binding contours.  If this is 1 when
	TREE_PACKED is set to 1, it is an error.

	Any other invalid goto must have a fixup.  fixup_gotos detects
	such invalid gotos.  fixup_gotos takes a second arg, which
	is the first insn of the contour now being exited.
