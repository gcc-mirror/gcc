/* This file contains a data structure that describes a GCC target.
   At present it is incomplete, but in future it should grow to
   contain most or all target machine and target O/S specific
   information.

   This structure has its initializer declared in target-def.h in the
   form of large macro TARGET_INITIALIZER that expands to many smaller
   macros.

   The smaller macros each initialize one component of the structure,
   and each has a default.  Each target should have a file that
   includes target.h and target-def.h, and overrides any inappropriate
   defaults by undefining the relevant macro and defining a suitable
   replacement.  That file should then contain the definition of
   "targetm" like so:

   struct gcc_target targetm = TARGET_INITIALIZER;

   Doing things this way allows us to bring together everything that
   defines a GCC target.  By supplying a default that is appropriate
   to most targets, we can easily add new items without needing to
   edit dozens of target configuration files.  It should also allow us
   to gradually reduce the amount of conditional compilation that is
   scattered throughout GCC.  */
