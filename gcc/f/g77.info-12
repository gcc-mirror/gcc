...........................

     Rename(PATH1, PATH2)

Rename: `INTEGER(KIND=1)' function.

PATH1: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

PATH2: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: `badu77'.

Description:

   Renames the file PATH1 to PATH2.  A null character (`CHAR(0)') marks
the end of the names in PATH1 and PATH2--otherwise, trailing blanks in
PATH1 and PATH2 are ignored.  See `rename(2)'.  Returns 0 on success or
a non-zero error code.

   Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

File: g77.info,  Node: Signal Intrinsic (function),  Next: SinD Intrinsic,  Prev: Secnds Intrinsic,  Up: Other Intrinsics

Signal Intrinsic (function)
...........................

     Signal(NUMBER, HANDLER)

Signal: `INTEGER(KIND=1)' function.

NUMBER: `INTEGER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

HANDLER: Signal handler (`INTEGER FUNCTION' or `SUBROUTINE') or
dummy/global `INTEGER(KIND=1)' scalar.

Intrinsic groups: `badu77'.

Description:

   If HANDLER is a an `EXTERNAL' routine, arranges for it to be invoked
with a single integer argument (of system-dependent length) when signal
NUMBER occurs.  If NUMBER is an integer, it can be used to turn off
handling of signal HANDLER or revert to its default action.  See
`signal(2)'.

   Note that HANDLER will be called using C conventions, so its value in
Fortran terms is obtained by applying `%LOC()' (or LOC()) to it.

   The value returned by `signal(2)' is returned.

   Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

SymLnk Intrinsic (function)
...........................

     SymLnk(PATH1, PATH2)

SymLnk: `INTEGER(KIND=1)' function.

PATH1: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

PATH2: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: `badu77'.

Description:

   Makes a symbolic link from file PATH1 to PATH2.  A null character
(`CHAR(0)') marks the end of the names in PATH1 and PATH2--otherwise,
trailing blanks in PATH1 and PATH2 are ignored.  Returns 0 on success
or a non-zero error code (`ENOSYS' if the system does not provide
`symlink(2)').

   Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

System Intrinsic (function)
...........................

     System(COMMAND)

System: `INTEGER(KIND=1)' function.

COMMAND: `CHARACTER'; scalar; INTENT(IN).

Intrinsic groups: `badu77'.

Description:

   Passes the command COMMAND to a shell (see `system(3)').  Returns
the value returned by `system(3)', presumably 0 if the shell command
succeeded.  Note that which shell is used to invoke the command is
system-dependent and environment-dependent.

   Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.  However, the function form can be valid in
cases where the actual side effects performed by the call are
unimportant to the application.

   For example, on a UNIX system, `SAME = SYSTEM('cmp a b')' does not
perform any side effects likely to be important to the program, so the
programmer would not care if the actual system call (and invocation of
`cmp') was optimized away in a situation where the return value could
be determined otherwise, or was not actually needed (`SAME' not
actually referenced after the sample assignment statement).

Intrinsic groups: `badu77'.

Description:

   Sets the file creation mask to MASK and returns the old value.  See
`umask(2)'.

   Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function
form is not recommended.

***************

   An individual Fortran source file can be compiled to an object
(`*.o') file instead of to the final program executable.  This allows
several portions of a program to be compiled at different times and
linked together whenever a new version of the program is needed.
However, it introduces the issue of "object compatibility" across the
various object files (and libraries, or `*.a' files) that are linked
together to produce any particular executable file.

   Object compatibility is an issue when combining, in one program,
Fortran code compiled by more than one compiler (or more than one
configuration of a compiler).  If the compilers disagree on how to
transform the names of procedures, there will normally be errors when
linking such programs.  Worse, if the compilers agree on naming, but
disagree on issues like how to pass parameters, return arguments, and
lay out `COMMON' areas, the earliest detected errors might be the
incorrect results produced by the program (and that assumes these
errors are detected, which is not always the case).

   Normally, `g77' generates code that is object-compatible with code
generated by a version of `f2c' configured (with, for example, `f2c.h'
definitions) to be generally compatible with `g77' as built by `gcc'.
(Normally, `f2c' will, by default, conform to the appropriate
configuration, but it is possible that older or perhaps even newer
versions of `f2c', or versions having certain configuration changes to
`f2c' internals, will produce object files that are incompatible with
`g77'.)

   For example, a Fortran string subroutine argument will become two
arguments on the C side: a `char *' and an `int' length.

   Much of this compatibility results from the fact that `g77' uses the
same run-time library, `libf2c', used by `f2c'.

   Other compilers might or might not generate code that is
object-compatible with `libf2c' and current `g77', and some might offer
such compatibility only when explicitly selected via a command-line
option to the compiler.

Dropping `f2c' Compatibility
============================

   Specifying `-fno-f2c' allows `g77' to generate, in some cases,
faster code, by not needing to allow to the possibility of linking with
code compiled by `f2c'.

   For example, this affects how `REAL(KIND=1)', `COMPLEX(KIND=1)', and
`COMPLEX(KIND=2)' functions are called.  With `-fno-f2c', they are
compiled as returning the appropriate `gcc' type (`float', `__complex__
float', `__complex__ double', in many configurations).

   With `-ff2c' in force, they are compiled differently (with perhaps
slower run-time performance) to accommodate the restrictions inherent
in `f2c''s use of K&R C as an intermediate language--`REAL(KIND=1)'
functions return C's `double' type, while `COMPLEX' functions return
`void' and use an extra argument pointing to a place for the functions
to return their values.

   It is possible that, in some cases, leaving `-ff2c' in force might
produce faster code than using `-fno-f2c'.  Feel free to experiment,
but remember to experiment with changing the way *entire programs and
their Fortran libraries are compiled* at a time, since this sort of
experimentation affects the interface of code generated for a Fortran
source file--that is, it affects object compatibility.

   Note that `f2c' compatibility is a fairly static target to achieve,
though not necessarily perfectly so, since, like `g77', it is still
being improved.  However, specifying `-fno-f2c' causes `g77' to
generate code that will probably be incompatible with code generated by
future versions of `g77' when the same option is in force.  You should
make sure you are always able to recompile complete programs from
source code when upgrading to new versions of `g77' or `f2c',
especially when using options such as `-fno-f2c'.

   Therefore, if you are using `g77' to compile libraries and other
object files for possible future use and you don't want to require
recompilation for future use with subsequent versions of `g77', you
might want to stick with `f2c' compatibility for now, and carefully
watch for any announcements about changes to the `f2c'/`libf2c'
interface that might affect existing programs (thus requiring
recompilation).

   It is probable that a future version of `g77' will not, by default,
generate object files compatible with `f2c', and that version probably
would no longer use `libf2c'.  If you expect to depend on this
compatibility in the long term, use the options `-ff2c -ff2c-library'
when compiling all of the applicable code.  This should cause future
versions of `g77' either to produce compatible code (at the expense of
the availability of some features and performance), or at the very
least, to produce diagnostics.

Compilers Other Than `f2c'
==========================

   On systems with Fortran compilers other than `f2c' and `g77', code
compiled by `g77' is not expected to work well with code compiled by
the native compiler.  (This is true for `f2c'-compiled objects as
well.)  Libraries compiled with the native compiler probably will have
to be recompiled with `g77' to be used with `g77'-compiled code.

   Reasons for such incompatibilities include:

   * There might be differences in the way names of Fortran procedures
     are translated for use in the system's object-file format.  For
     example, the statement `CALL FOO' might be compiled by `g77' to
     call a procedure the linker `ld' sees given the name `_foo_',
     while the apparently corresponding statement `SUBROUTINE FOO'
     might be compiled by the native compiler to define the
     linker-visible name `_foo', or `_FOO_', and so on.

   * There might be subtle type mismatches which cause subroutine
     arguments and function return values to get corrupted.

     This is why simply getting `g77' to transform procedure names the
     same way a native compiler does is not usually a good idea--unless
     some effort has been made to ensure that, aside from the way the
     two compilers transform procedure names, everything else about the
     way they generate code for procedure interfaces is identical.

   * Native compilers use libraries of private I/O routines which will
     not be available at link time unless you have the native
     compiler--and you would have to explicitly ask for them.

     For example, on the Sun you would have to add `-L/usr/lang/SCx.x
     -lF77 -lV77' to the link command.

Tools and advice for interoperating with C and C++
==================================================

   The following discussion assumes that you are running `g77' in `f2c'
compatibility mode, i.e. not using `-fno-f2c'.  It provides some advice
about quick and simple techniques for linking Fortran and C (or C++),
the most common requirement.  For the full story consult the
description of code generation.  *Note Debugging and Interfacing::.

   When linking Fortran and C, it's usually best to use `g77' to do the
linking so that the correct libraries are included (including the maths
one).  If you're linking with C++ you will want to add `-lstdc++',
`-lg++' or whatever.  If you need to use another driver program (or
`ld' directly), you can find out what linkage options `g77' passes by
running `g77 -v'.

C Interfacing Tools
-------------------

   Even if you don't actually use it as a compiler, `f2c' from
`ftp://ftp.netlib.org/f2c/src', can be a useful tool when you're
interfacing (linking) Fortran and C.  *Note Generating Skeletons and
Prototypes with `f2c': f2c Skeletons and Prototypes.

   To use `f2c' for this purpose you only need retrieve and build the
`src' directory from the distribution, consult the `README'
instructions there for machine-specifics, and install the `f2c' program
on your path.

   Something else that might be useful is `cfortran.h' from
`ftp://zebra/desy.de/cfortran'.  This is a fairly general tool which
can be used to generate interfaces for calling in both directions
between Fortran and C.  It can be used in `f2c' mode with
`g77'--consult its documentation for details.


File: g77.info,  Node: C Access to Type Information,  Next: f2c Skeletons and Prototypes,  Prev: C Interfacing Tools,  Up: Interoperating with C and C++

Accessing Type Information in C
-------------------------------

   Generally, C code written to link with `g77' code--calling and/or
being called from Fortran--should `#include <f2c.h>' to define the C
versions of the Fortran types.  Don't assume Fortran `INTEGER' types
correspond to C `int's, for instance; instead, declare them as
`integer', a type defined by `f2c.h'.  `f2c.h' is installed where `gcc'
will find it by default, assuming you use a copy of `gcc' compatible
with `g77', probably built at the same time as `g77'.


File: g77.info,  Node: f2c Skeletons and Prototypes,  Next: C++ Considerations,  Prev: C Access to Type Information,  Up: Interoperating with C and C++

Generating Skeletons and Prototypes with `f2c'
----------------------------------------------

   A simple and foolproof way to write `g77'-callable C routines--e.g.
to interface with an existing library--is to write a file (named, for
example, `fred.f') of dummy Fortran skeletons comprising just the
declaration of the routine(s) and dummy arguments plus `END' statements.
Then run `f2c' on file `fred.f' to produce `fred.c' into which you can
edit useful code, confident the calling sequence is correct, at least.
(There are some errors otherwise commonly made in generating C
interfaces with f2c conventions, such as not using `doublereal' as the
return type of a `REAL' `FUNCTION'.)

   `f2c' also can help with calling Fortran from C, using its `-P'
option to generate C prototypes appropriate for calling the Fortran.(1)
If the Fortran code containing any routines to be called from C is in
file `joe.f', use the command `f2c -P joe.f' to generate the file
`joe.P' containing prototype information.  `#include' this in the C
which has to call the Fortran routines to make sure you get it right.

   *Note Arrays (DIMENSION: Arrays, for information on the differences
between the way Fortran (including compilers like `g77') and C handle
arrays.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The files generated like this can also be used for inter-unit
consistency checking of dummy and actual arguments, although the
`ftnchek' tool from `ftp://ftp.netlib.org/fortran' or
`ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu' is probably better for this purpose.


File: g77.info,  Node: C++ Considerations,  Next: Startup Code,  Prev: f2c Skeletons and Prototypes,  Up: Interoperating with C and C++

C++ Considerations
------------------

   `f2c' can be used to generate suitable code for compilation with a
C++ system using the `-C++' option.  The important thing about linking
`g77'-compiled code with C++ is that the prototypes for the `g77'
routines must specify C linkage to avoid name mangling.  So, use an
`extern "C"' declaration.  `f2c''s `-C++' option will take care of this
when generating skeletons or prototype files as above, and also avoid
clashes with C++ reserved words in addition to those in C.


File: g77.info,  Node: Startup Code,  Prev: C++ Considerations,  Up: Interoperating with C and C++

Startup Code
------------

   Unlike with some runtime systems, it shouldn't be necessary (unless
there are bugs) to use a Fortran main program to ensure the
runtime--specifically the i/o system--is initialized.  However, to use
the `g77' intrinsics `GETARG()' and `IARGC()' the `main()' routine from
the `libf2c' library must be used, either explicitly or implicitly by
using a Fortran main program.  This `main()' program calls `MAIN__()'
(where the names are C-type `extern' names, i.e. not mangled).  You
need to provide this nullary procedure as the entry point for your C
code if using `libf2c''s `main'.  In some cases it might be necessary to
provide a dummy version of this to avoid linkers complaining about
failure to resolve `MAIN__()' if linking against `libf2c' and not using
`main()' from it.

Installing GNU Fortran
**********************

   The following information describes how to install `g77'.

   The information in this file generally pertains to dealing with
*source* distributions of `g77' and `gcc'.  It is possible that some of
this information will be applicable to some *binary* distributions of
these products--however, since these distributions are not made by the
maintainers of `g77', responsibility for binary distributions rests with
whoever built and first distributed them.

   Nevertheless, efforts to make `g77' easier to both build and install
from source and package up as a binary distribution are ongoing.

File: g77.info,  Node: Prerequisites,  Next: Problems Installing,  Up: Installation

Prerequisites
=============

   The procedures described to unpack, configure, build, and install
`g77' assume your system has certain programs already installed.

   The following prerequisites should be met by your system before you
follow the `g77' installation instructions:

`gzip'
     To unpack the `gcc' and `g77' distributions, you'll need the
     `gunzip' utility in the `gzip' distribution.  Most UNIX systems
     already have `gzip' installed.  If yours doesn't, you can get it
     from the FSF.

     Note that you'll need `tar' and other utilities as well, but all
     UNIX systems have these.  There are GNU versions of all these
     available--in fact, a complete GNU UNIX system can be put together
     on most systems, if desired.

     The version of GNU `gzip' used to package this release is 1.24.
     (The version of GNU `tar' used to package this release is 1.11.2.)

`gcc-2.7.2.3.tar.gz'
     You need to have this, or some other applicable, version of `gcc'
     on your system.  The version should be an exact copy of a
     distribution from the FSF.  Its size is approximately 7.1MB.

     If you've already unpacked `gcc-2.7.2.3.tar.gz' into a directory
     (named `gcc-2.7.2.3') called the "source tree" for `gcc', you can
     delete the distribution itself, but you'll need to remember to
     skip any instructions to unpack this distribution.

     Without an applicable `gcc' source tree, you cannot build `g77'.
     You can obtain an FSF distribution of `gcc' from the FSF.

`g77-0.5.21.tar.gz'
     You probably have already unpacked this package, or you are
     reading an advance copy of these installation instructions, which
     are contained in this distribution.  The size of this package is
     approximately 1.5MB.

     You can obtain an FSF distribution of `g77' from the FSF, the same
     way you obtained `gcc'.

Enough disk space
     The amount of disk space needed to unpack, build, install, and use
     `g77' depends on the type of system you're using, how you build
     `g77', and how much of it you install (primarily, which languages
     you install).

     The sizes shown below assume all languages distributed in
     `gcc-2.7.2.3', plus `g77', will be built and installed.  These
     sizes are indicative of GNU/Linux systems on Intel x86 running
     COFF and on Digital Alpha (AXP) systems running ELF.  These should
     be fairly representative of 32-bit and 64-bit systems,
     respectively.

     Note that all sizes are approximate and subject to change without
     notice!  They are based on preliminary releases of g77 made shortly
     before the public beta release.

        -- `gcc' and `g77' distributions occupy 8.6MB packed, 35MB
          unpacked.  These consist of the source code and documentation,
          plus some derived files (mostly documentation), for `gcc' and
          `g77'.  Any deviations from these numbers for different kinds
          of systems are likely to be very minor.

        -- A "bootstrap" build requires an additional 67.3MB for a
          total of 102MB on an ix86, and an additional 98MB for a total
          of 165MB on an Alpha.

        -- Removing `gcc/stage1' after the build recovers 10.7MB for a
          total of 91MB on an ix86, and recovers ??MB for a total of
          ??MB on an Alpha.

          After doing this, the integrity of the build can still be
          verified via `make compare', and the `gcc' compiler modified
          and used to build itself for testing fairly quickly, using
          the copy of the compiler kept in `gcc/stage2'.

        -- Removing `gcc/stage2' after the build further recovers
          27.3MB for a total of 64.3MB, and recovers ??MB for a total
          of ??MB on an Alpha.

          After doing this, the compiler can still be installed,
          especially if GNU `make' is used to avoid gratuitous rebuilds
          (or, the installation can be done by hand).

        -- Installing `gcc' and `g77' copies 14.9MB onto the `--prefix'
          disk for a total of 79.2MB on an ix86, and copies ??MB onto
          the `--prefix' disk for a total of ??MB on an Alpha.

     After installation, if no further modifications and builds of
     `gcc' or `g77' are planned, the source and build directory may be
     removed, leaving the total impact on a system's disk storage as
     that of the amount copied during installation.

     Systems with the appropriate version of `gcc' installed don't
     require the complete bootstrap build.  Doing a "straight build"
     requires about as much space as does a bootstrap build followed by
     removing both the `gcc/stage1' and `gcc/stage2' directories.

     Installing `gcc' and `g77' over existing versions might require
     less *new* disk space, but note that, unlike many products, `gcc'
     installs itself in a way that avoids overwriting other installed
     versions of itself, so that other versions may easily be invoked
     (via `gcc -V VERSION').

     So, the amount of space saved as a result of having an existing
     version of `gcc' and `g77' already installed is not
     much--typically only the command drivers (`gcc', `g77', `g++', and
     so on, which are small) and the documentation is overwritten by
     the new installation.  The rest of the new installation is done
     without replacing existing installed versions (assuming they have
     different version numbers).

`patch'
     Although you can do everything `patch' does yourself, by hand,
     without much trouble, having `patch' installed makes installation
     of new versions of GNU utilities such as `g77' so much easier that
     it is worth getting.  You can obtain `patch' the same way you
     obtained `gcc' and `g77'.

     In any case, you can apply patches by hand--patch files are
     designed for humans to read them.

     The version of GNU `patch' used to develop this release is 2.4.

`make'
     Your system must have `make', and you will probably save yourself
     a lot of trouble if it is GNU `make' (sometimes referred to as
     `gmake').

     The version of GNU `make' used to develop this release is 3.73.

`cc'
     Your system must have a working C compiler.

     *Note Installing GNU CC: (gcc)Installation, for more information
     on prerequisites for installing `gcc'.

`bison'
     If you do not have `bison' installed, you can usually work around
     any need for it, since `g77' itself does not use it, and `gcc'
     normally includes all files generated by running it in its
     distribution.  You can obtain `bison' the same way you obtained
     `gcc' and `g77'.

     The version of GNU `bison' used to develop this release is 1.25.

     *Note Missing bison?::, for information on how to work around not
     having `bison'.

`makeinfo'
     If you are missing `makeinfo', you can usually work around any
     need for it.  You can obtain `makeinfo' the same way you obtained
     `gcc' and `g77'.

     The version of GNU `makeinfo' used to develop this release is
     1.68, from GNU `texinfo' version 3.11.

     *Note Missing makeinfo?::, for information on getting around the
     lack of `makeinfo'.

`sed'
     All UNIX systems have `sed', but some have a broken version that
     cannot handle configuring, building, or installing `gcc' or `g77'.

     The version of GNU `sed' used to develop this release is 2.05.
     (Note that GNU `sed' version 3.0 was withdrawn by the FSF--if you
     happen to have this version installed, replace it with version
     2.05 immediately.  See a GNU distribution site for further
     explanation.)

`root' access or equivalent
     To perform the complete installation procedures on a system, you
     need to have `root' access to that system, or equivalent access to
     the `--prefix' directory tree specified on the `configure' command
     line.

     Portions of the procedure (such as configuring and building `g77')
     can be performed by any user with enough disk space and virtual
     memory.

     However, these instructions are oriented towards less-experienced
     users who want to install `g77' on their own personal systems.

     System administrators with more experience will want to determine
     for themselves how they want to modify the procedures described
     below to suit the needs of their installation.

GNU C Required
..............

   Compiling `g77' requires GNU C, not just ANSI C.  Fixing this
wouldn't be very hard (just tedious), but the code using GNU extensions
to the C language is expected to be rewritten for 0.6 anyway, so there
are no plans for an interim fix.

   This requirement does not mean you must already have `gcc' installed
to build `g77'.  As long as you have a working C compiler, you can use a
bootstrap build to automate the process of first building `gcc' using
the working C compiler you have, then building `g77' and rebuilding
`gcc' using that just-built `gcc', and so on.
