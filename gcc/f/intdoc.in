/* This is the file containing the verbage for the
   intrinsics.  It consists of a data base built up
   via DEFDOC macros of the form:

   DEFDOC (IMP, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION)

   IMP is the implementation keyword used in the intrin module.
   SUMMARY is the short summary to go in the "* Menu:" section
   of the Info document.  DESCRIPTION is the longer description
   to go in the documentation itself.

   Note that IMP is leveraged across multiple intrinsic names.

   To make for more accurate and consistent documentation,
   the translation made by intdoc.c of the text in SUMMARY
   and DESCRIPTION includes the special sequence

   @ARGNO@

   where ARGNO is a series of digits forming a number that
   is substituted by intdoc.c as follows:

   0     The initial-caps form of the intrinsic name (e.g. Float).
   1-98  The initial-caps form of the ARGNO'th argument.
   99    (SUMMARY only) a newline plus the appropriate # of spaces.

   Hope this info is enough to encourage people to feel free to
   add documentation to this file!

(@samp{CMPLX(0D0, 0D0)} returns a single-precision

construction of arbitrary-precision values without

requires use of the @code{%VAL()} construct
to pass an @code{INTEGER} value
(such as @samp{SIG_IGN} or @samp{SIG_DFL})
for the @var{@2@} argument.

However, while @samp{RTN = SIGNAL(@var{signum}, %VAL(SIG_IGN))}
works when @samp{SIGNAL} is treated as an external procedure
(and resolves, at link time, to @code{libf2c}'s @samp{signal_} routine),
this construct is not valid when @samp{SIGNAL} is recognized
as the intrinsic of that name.

Therefore, for maximum portability and reliability,
code such references to the @samp{SIGNAL} facility as follows:

@smallexample
INTRINSIC SIGNAL
@dots{}
RTN = SIGNAL(@var{signum}, SIG_IGN)
@end smallexample

@code{g77} will compile such a call correctly,
while other compilers will generally either do so as well
or reject the @samp{INTRINSIC SIGNAL} statement via a diagnostic,
allowing you to take appropriate action.

Due to the side effects performed by this intrinsic, the function

actual side effects performed by the call are unimportant to
the application.

For example, on a UNIX system, @samp{SAME = SYSTEM('cmp a b')}
does not perform any side effects likely to be important to the
program, so the programmer would not care if the actual system
call (and invocation of @code{cmp}) was optimized away in a situation
where the return value could be determined otherwise, or was not
actually needed (@samp{SAME} not actually referenced after the
sample assignment statement).
