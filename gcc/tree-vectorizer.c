/* Loop Vectorization Pass.

   This pass tries to vectorize loops. This first implementation focuses on
   simple inner-most loops, with no conditional control flow, and a set of
   simple operations which vector form can be expressed using existing
   tree codes (PLUS, MULT etc).

   For example, the vectorizer transforms the following simple loop:

	short a[N]; short b[N]; short c[N]; int i;

	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
	}

   as if it was manually vectorized by rewriting the source code into:

	typedef int __attribute__((mode(V8HI))) v8hi;
	short a[N];  short b[N]; short c[N];   int i;
	v8hi *pa = (v8hi*)a, *pb = (v8hi*)b, *pc = (v8hi*)c;
	v8hi va, vb, vc;

	for (i=0; i<N/8; i++){
	  vb = pb[i];
	  vc = pc[i];
	  va = vb + vc;
	  pa[i] = va;
	}

	The main entry to this pass is vectorize_loops(), in which
   the vectorizer applies a set of analyses on a given set of loops,
   followed by the actual vectorization transformation for the loops that
   had successfully passed the analysis phase.

	Throughout this pass we make a distinction between two types of
   data: scalars (which are represented by SSA_NAMES), and memory references
   ("data-refs"). These two types of data require different handling both 
   during analysis and transformation. The types of data-refs that the 
   vectorizer currently supports are ARRAY_REFS that are one dimensional 
   arrays which base is an array DECL (not a pointer), and INDIRECT_REFS 
   through pointers; both array and pointer accesses are required to have a 
   simple (consecutive) access pattern.

   Analysis phase:
   ===============
	The driver for the analysis phase is vect_analyze_loop_nest().
   It applies a set of analyses, some of which rely on the scalar evolution 
   analyzer (scev) developed by Sebastian Pop.

	During the analysis phase the vectorizer records some information
   per stmt in a "stmt_vec_info" struct which is attached to each stmt in the 
   loop, as well as general information about the loop as a whole, which is
   recorded in a "loop_vec_info" struct attached to each loop.

   Transformation phase:
   =====================
	The loop transformation phase scans all the stmts in the loop, and
   creates a vector stmt (or a sequence of stmts) for each scalar stmt S in
   the loop that needs to be vectorized. It insert the vector code sequence
   just before the scalar stmt S, and records a pointer to the vector code
   in STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info) (stmt_info is the stmt_vec_info struct 
   attached to S). This pointer will be used for the vectorization of following
   stmts which use the def of stmt S. Stmt S is removed if it writes to memory;
   otherwise, we rely on dead code elimination for removing it.

	For example, say stmt S1 was vectorized into stmt VS1:

   VS1: vb = px[i];
   S1:	b = x[i];    STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)) = VS1
   S2:  a = b;

   To vectorize stmt S2, the vectorizer first finds the stmt that defines
   the operand 'b' (S1), and gets the relevant vector def 'vb' from the
   vector stmt VS1 pointed by STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)). The
   resulting sequence would be:

   VS1: vb = px[i];
   S1:	b = x[i];	STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)) = VS1
   VS2: va = vb;
   S2:  a = b;          STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S2)) = VS2

	Operands that are not SSA_NAMEs, are data-refs that appear in 
   load/store operations (like 'x[i]' in S1), and are handled differently.

   Target modeling:
   =================
	Currently the only target specific information that is used is the
   size of the vector (in bytes) - "UNITS_PER_SIMD_WORD". Targets that can 
   support different sizes of vectors, for now will need to specify one value 
   for "UNITS_PER_SIMD_WORD". More flexibility will be added in the future.

	Since we only vectorize operations which vector form can be
   expressed using existing tree codes, to verify that an operation is
   supported, the vectorizer checks the relevant optab at the relevant
   machine_mode (e.g, add_optab->handlers[(int) V8HImode].insn_code). If
   the value found is CODE_FOR_nothing, then there's no target support, and
   we can't vectorize the stmt.

     This pass will require a cost model to guide it whether to apply peeling 
     or versioning or a combination of the two. For example, the scheme that
     intel uses when given a loop with several memory accesses, is as follows:
     choose one memory access ('p') which alignment you want to force by doing 
     peeling. Then, either (1) generate a loop in which 'p' is aligned and all 
     other accesses are not necessarily aligned, or (2) use loop versioning to 
     generate one loop in which all accesses are aligned, and another loop in 
     which only 'p' is necessarily aligned. 

     ("Automatic Intra-Register Vectorization for the Intel Architecture",
      Aart J.C. Bik, Milind Girkar, Paul M. Grey and Ximmin Tian, International
      Journal of Parallel Programming, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 2002.)	

     Devising a cost model is the most critical aspect of this work. It will 
     guide us on which access to peel for, whether to use loop versioning, how 
     many versions to create, etc. The cost model will probably consist of 
     generic considerations as well as target specific considerations (on 
     powerpc for example, misaligned stores are more painful than misaligned 
     loads). 

     Here is the general steps involved in alignment enhancements:
    
     -- original loop, before alignment analysis:
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = unknown
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
	}

     -- After vect_compute_data_refs_alignment:
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
	}

     -- Possibility 1: we do loop versioning:
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){	# loop 1A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     } 
     else {
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){	# loop 1B
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
	}
     }
   
     -- Possibility 2: we do loop peeling:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	# (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
	x = q[i];
	p[i] = y;
     }
     for (i = 3; i < N; i++){	# loop 2A
	x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
     }

     -- Possibility 3: combination of loop peeling and versioning:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	# (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
	x = q[i];
	p[i] = y;
     }
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){  # loop 3A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     } 
     else {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){	# loop 3B
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
	}
     }

     These loops are later passed to loop_transform to be vectorized. The 
     vectorizer will use the alignment information to guide the transformation 
     (whether to generate regular loads/stores, or with special handling for 
     misalignment).
