/* Used to create the variable mapping when we go out of SSA form.

   Mapping from an ssa_name to a partition number is maintained, as well as
   partition number back to ssa_name.

   This data structure also supports "views", which work on a subset of all
   partitions.  This allows the coalescer to decide what partitions are
   interesting to it, and only work with those partitions.  Whenever the view
   is changed, the partition numbers change, but none of the partition groupings
   change. (ie, it is truly a view since it doesn't change anything)

   The final component of the data structure is the basevar map.  This provides
   a list of all the different base variables which occur in a partition view,
   and a unique index for each one. Routines are provided to quickly produce
   the base variable of a partition.

   Note that members of a partition MUST all have the same base variable.  */

/*  ---------------- live on entry/exit info ------------------------------

    This structure is used to represent live range information on SSA based
    trees. A partition map must be provided, and based on the active partitions,
    live-on-entry information and live-on-exit information can be calculated.
    As well, partitions are marked as to whether they are global (live
    outside the basic block they are defined in).

    The live-on-entry information is per block.  It provide a bitmap for
    each block which has a bit set for each partition that is live on entry to
    that block.

    The live-on-exit information is per block.  It provides a bitmap for each
    block indicating which partitions are live on exit from the block.

    For the purposes of this implementation, we treat the elements of a PHI
    as follows:

       Uses in a PHI are considered LIVE-ON-EXIT to the block from which they
       originate. They are *NOT* considered live on entry to the block
       containing the PHI node.

       The Def of a PHI node is *not* considered live on entry to the block.
       It is considered to be "define early" in the block. Picture it as each
       block having a stmt (or block-preheader) before the first real stmt in
       the block which defines all the variables that are defined by PHIs.
