/* Data type to hold probabilities.  It implements fixed point arithmetics
   with capping so probability is always in range [0,1] and scaling requiring
   values greater than 1 needs to be represented otherwise.

   In addition to actual value the quality of profile is tracked and propagated
   through all operations.  Special value UNINITIALIZED_PROFILE is used for probabilities
   that has not been determined yet (for example because of
   -fno-guess-branch-probability)

   Typically probabilities are derived from profile feedback (via
   probability_in_gcov_type), autoFDO or guessed statically and then propagated
   thorough the compilation.

   Named probabilities are available:
     - never           (0 probability)
     - guessed_never
     - very_unlikely   (1/2000 probability)
     - unlikely        (1/5 probability)
     - even            (1/2 probability)
     - likely          (4/5 probability)
     - very_likely     (1999/2000 probability)
     - guessed_always
     - always

   Named probabilities except for never/always are assumed to be statically
   guessed and thus not necessarily accurate.  The difference between never
   and guessed_never is that the first one should be used only in case that
   well behaving program will very likely not execute the "never" path.
   For example if the path is going to abort () call or it exception handling.

   Always and guessed_always probabilities are symmetric.

   For legacy code we support conversion to/from REG_BR_PROB_BASE based fixpoint
   integer arithmetics. Once the code is converted to branch probabilities,
   these conversions will probably go away because they are lossy.

/* Main data type to hold profile counters in GCC. Profile counts originate
   either from profile feedback, static profile estimation or both.  We do not
   perform whole program profile propagation and thus profile estimation
   counters are often local to function, while counters from profile feedback
   (or special cases of profile estimation) can be used inter-procedurally.

   There are 3 basic types
     1) local counters which are result of intra-procedural static profile
        estimation.
     2) ipa counters which are result of profile feedback or special case
        of static profile estimation (such as in function main).
     3) counters which counts as 0 inter-procedurally (because given function
        was never run in train feedback) but they hold local static profile
        estimate.

   Counters of type 1 and 3 cannot be mixed with counters of different type
   within operation (because whole function should use one type of counter)
   with exception that global zero mix in most operations where outcome is
   well defined.

   To take local counter and use it inter-procedurally use ipa member function
   which strips information irrelevant at the inter-procedural level.

   Counters are 61bit integers representing number of executions during the
   train run or normalized frequency within the function.

   As the profile is maintained during the compilation, many adjustments are
   made.  Not all transformations can be made precisely, most importantly
   when code is being duplicated.  It also may happen that part of CFG has
   profile counts known while other do not - for example when LTO optimizing
   partly profiled program or when profile was lost due to COMDAT merging.

   For this reason profile_count tracks more information than
   just unsigned integer and it is also ready for profile mismatches.
   The API of this data type represent operations that are natural
   on profile counts - sum, difference and operation with scales and
   probabilities.  All operations are safe by never getting negative counts
   and they do end up in uninitialized scale if any of the parameters is
   uninitialized.

   All comparisons that are three state and handling of probabilities.  Thus
   a < b is not equal to !(a >= b).

   The following pre-defined counts are available:

   profile_count::zero ()  for code that is known to execute zero times at
      runtime (this can be detected statically i.e. for paths leading to
      abort ();
   profile_count::one () for code that is known to execute once (such as
      main () function
   profile_count::uninitialized ()  for unknown execution count.
