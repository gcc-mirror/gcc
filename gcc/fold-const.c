/* The entry points in this file are fold, size_int_wide, size_binop
   and force_fit_type.

   fold takes a tree as argument and returns a simplified tree.

   size_binop takes a tree code for an arithmetic operation
   and two operands that are trees, and produces a tree for the
   result, assuming the type comes from `sizetype'.

   size_int takes an integer value, and creates a tree constant
   with type from `sizetype'.

   force_fit_type takes a constant and prior overflow indicator, and
   forces the value to fit the type.  It returns an overflow indicator.  */

/* Return nonzero if two operands (typically of the same tree node)

   If ONLY_CONST is nonzero, only return nonzero for constants.
   This function tests whether the operands are indistinguishable;
   it does not test whether they are equal using C's == operation.
   The distinction is important for IEEE floating point, because
   (1) -0.0 and 0.0 are distinguishable, but -0.0==0.0, and
   (2) two NaNs may be indistinguishable, but NaN!=NaN.

   If ONLY_CONST is zero, a VAR_DECL is considered equal to itself
   even though it may hold multiple values during a function.
   This is because a GCC tree node guarantees that nothing else is
   executed between the evaluation of its "operands" (which may often
   be evaluated in arbitrary order).  Hence if the operands themselves
   don't side-effect, the VAR_DECLs, PARM_DECLs etc... must hold the
   same value in each operand/subexpression.  Hence a zero value for
   ONLY_CONST assumes isochronic (or instantaneous) tree equivalence.

/* The following functions are subroutines to fold_range_test and allow it to

   For example, both
	X == 2 || X == 3 || X == 4 || X == 5
   and
	X >= 2 && X <= 5
   are converted to
	(unsigned) (X - 2) <= 3

   We describe each set of comparisons as being either inside or outside
   a range, using a variable named like IN_P, and then describe the
   range with a lower and upper bound.  If one of the bounds is omitted,
   it represents either the highest or lowest value of the type.

   In the comments below, we represent a range by two numbers in brackets
   preceded by a "+" to designate being inside that range, or a "-" to
   designate being outside that range, so the condition can be inverted by
   flipping the prefix.  An omitted bound is represented by a "-".  For
   example, "- [-, 10]" means being outside the range starting at the lowest
   possible value and ending at 10, in other words, being greater than 10.
   The range "+ [-, -]" is always true and hence the range "- [-, -]" is
   always false.

   We set up things so that the missing bounds are handled in a consistent
   manner so neither a missing bound nor "true" and "false" need to be
   handled using a special case.  */

/* Determine if first argument is a multiple of second argument.  Return 0 if

   An example of the sort of thing we care about (at this point; this routine
   could surely be made more general, and expanded to do what the *_DIV_EXPR's
   fold cases do now) is discovering that

     SAVE_EXPR (I) * SAVE_EXPR (J * 8)

   is a multiple of

     SAVE_EXPR (J * 8)

   when we know that the two SAVE_EXPR (J * 8) nodes are the same node.

   This code also handles discovering that

     SAVE_EXPR (I) * SAVE_EXPR (J * 8)

   is a multiple of 8 so we don't have to worry about dealing with a
   possible remainder.

   Note that we *look* inside a SAVE_EXPR only to determine how it was
   calculated; it is not safe for fold to do much of anything else with the
   internals of a SAVE_EXPR, since it cannot know when it will be evaluated
   at run time.  For example, the latter example above *cannot* be implemented
   as SAVE_EXPR (I) * J or any variant thereof, since the value of J at
   evaluation time of the original SAVE_EXPR is not necessarily the same at
   the time the new expression is evaluated.  The only optimization of this
   sort that would be valid is changing

     SAVE_EXPR (I) * SAVE_EXPR (SAVE_EXPR (J) * 8)

   divided by 8 to

     SAVE_EXPR (I) * SAVE_EXPR (J)

   (where the same SAVE_EXPR (J) is used in the original and the
   transformed version).  */
