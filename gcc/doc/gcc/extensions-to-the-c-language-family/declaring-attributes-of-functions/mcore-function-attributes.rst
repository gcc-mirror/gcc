MCORE Function Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These function attributes are supported by the MCORE back end:

.. index:: naked function attribute, MCORE

.. mcore-fn-attr:: naked

  This attribute allows the compiler to construct the
  requisite function declaration, while allowing the body of the
  function to be assembly code. The specified function will not have
  prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler. Only basic
  ``asm`` statements can safely be included in naked functions
  (see :ref:`basic-asm`). While using extended ``asm`` or a mixture of
  basic ``asm`` and C code may appear to work, they cannot be
  depended upon to work reliably and are not supported.
