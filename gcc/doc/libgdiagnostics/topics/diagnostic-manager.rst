Diagnostic Managers
===================

.. type:: diagnostic_manager;

A :type:`diagnostic_manager` is an opaque bundle of state for a client of
libgdiagnostics.

It has zero of more "output sinks" to which diagnostics are emitted.

Responsibilities include:

* location-management

* caching of source file content

* patch generation

.. function:: diagnostic_manager *diagnostic_manager_new (void)

   Create a new diagnostic_manager.
   The caller will need to call :func:`diagnostic_release_manager`
   on it at some point.

   .. note:: No output sinks are created by default; so you will want
      to create one with something like:

      .. code-block::

	diagnostic_manager_add_text_sink (diag_mgr, stderr,
                                          DIAGNOSTIC_COLORIZE_IF_TTY);

.. function::  void diagnostic_manager_release (diagnostic_manager *diag_mgr)

   Release a diagnostic_manager.

   This will flush output to all of the output sinks, and clean up.

   The parameter must be non-NULL.

.. function:: int diagnostic_manager_add_sink_from_spec (diagnostic_manager *affected_mgr, \
				       const char *option_name, \
				       const char *spec, \
				       diagnostic_manager *control_mgr)

   This function can be used to support option processing similar to GCC's
   :option:`-fdiagnostics-add-output=`.  This allows command-line tools to
   support the same domain-specific language for specifying output sink
   as GCC does.

   The function will attempt to parse :param:`spec` as if it were
   an argument to GCC's :option:`-fdiagnostics-add-output=OUTPUT-SPEC`.
   If successful, it will add an output sink to :param:`affected_mgr` and return zero.
   Otherwise, it will emit an error diagnostic to :param:`control_mgr` and
   return non-zero.

   :param:`affected_mgr` and :param:`control_mgr` can be the same manager,
   or be different managers.

   This function was added in :ref:`LIBGDIAGNOSTICS_ABI_2`; you can
   test for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

      #ifdef LIBDIAGNOSTICS_HAVE_diagnostic_manager_add_sink_from_spec


.. function:: void diagnostic_manager_set_analysis_target (diagnostic_manager *mgr, \
	                                                   const diagnostic_file *file)

   This function sets the "main input file" of :param:`mgr` to be
   :param:`file`.
   This affects the :code:`<title>` of generated HTML and
   the :code:`role` of the artifact in SARIF output (SARIF v2.1.0 section 3.24.6).

   This function was added in :ref:`LIBGDIAGNOSTICS_ABI_2`; you can
   test for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

      #ifdef LIBDIAGNOSTICS_HAVE_diagnostic_manager_set_analysis_target
