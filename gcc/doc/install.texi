The latest version of this document is always available at
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/install/,,http://gcc.gnu.org/install/}. 

This document describes the generic installation procedure for GCC as well
as detailing some target specific installation instructions. 

GCC includes several components that previously were separate distributions 
with their own installation instructions. This document supersedes all 
package specific installation instructions. We provide the component 
specific installation information in the source distribution for historical 
reference purposes only. 

@emph{Before} starting the build/install procedure please check the

We recommend you browse the entire generic installation instructions before 
you proceed.

The installation procedure itself is broken into five steps.

Please note that GCC does not support `@code{make uninstall}' and probably
won't do so in the near future as this would open a can of worms. Instead, 
we suggest that you install GCC into a directory of its own and simply
remove that directory when you do not need that specific version of GCC any longer.

GCC is distributed via CVS and FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or
bzip2. It is possible to download a full distribution or specific
components.

Please refer to our @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html,,releases web page}
for information on how to obtain GCC.

The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
and Chill compilers.  The full distribution also includes runtime libraries
for C++, Objective-C and Fortran.  In the future the GNU compiler testsuites
will be included in the full distribution.

If you choose to download specific components, you must download the core
gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you wish to
use.  The core distribution includes the C language front-end as well as the
shared components. Each language has a tarball which includes the language
front-end as well as the language runtime (when appropriate).

Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific
distributions in the same directory.

If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or
a separate one.  In the latter case, add symbolic links to any
components of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler
(bfd, binutils, gas, gprof, ld, opcodes,...) to the directory containing
the GCC sources.

@cindex Configuration
@cindex Installing GCC: Configuration

Like most GNU software, GCC must be configured before it can be built.
This document describes the recommended configuration procedure
for both native and cross targets.

We use @emph{srcdir} to refer to the toplevel source directory for
GCC; we use @emph{objdir} to refer to the toplevel build/object directory.

First, we @strong{highly} recommend that GCC be built into a
separate directory than the sources which does @strong{not} reside
within the source tree.  This is how we generally build GCC; building
where @emph{srcdir} == @emph{objdir} should still work, but doesn't
get extensive testing; building where @emph{objdir} is a subdirectory
of @emph{srcdir} is unsupported.

Second, when configuring a native system, either ``@command{cc}'' or
``@command{gcc}'' must be in your path or you must set @command{CC} in
your environment before running configure.  Otherwise the configuration
scripts may fail.

To configure GCC:

@example
   % mkdir @emph{objdir}
   % cd @emph{objdir}
   % @emph{srcdir}/configure @strong{[target] [options]}
@end example


@strong{target specification}
@itemize @bullet
@item
GCC has code to correctly determine the correct value for @strong{target}
for nearly all native systems.  Therefore, we highly recommend you not 
provide a configure target when configuring a native compiler.

@item
@strong{target} must be specified as @option{--target=}@emph{target}
when configuring a cross compiler; examples of valid targets would be 
i960-rtems, m68k-coff, sh-elf, etc.

@item
Specifying just @strong{target} instead of @option{--target=}@emph{target}
implies that the host defaults to @strong{target}.
@end itemize


@strong{options specification}

Use @strong{options} to override several configure time options for
GCC.  A partial list of supported @option{options}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@option{--prefix=}@emph{dirname} @minus{}@minus{} Specify the toplevel installation
directory.  This is the recommended way to install the tools into a directory
other than the default.  The toplevel installation directory defaults to
@code{/usr/local}.

We @strong{highly} recommend against @emph{dirname} being the same or a
subdirectory of @emph{objdir} or vice versa.

These additional options control where certain parts of the distribution
are installed.  Normally you should not need to use these options.
@itemize @bullet
@item
@option{--with-local-prefix=}@emph{dirname} @minus{}@minus{} Specify the installation
directory for local include files.  The default is @code{/usr/local}.

@item
@option{--with-gxx-include-dir=}@emph{dirname} @minus{}@minus{} Specify the installation
directory for g++ header files.  The default is @command{/usr/local/include/g++}.
  
@end itemize

@item
@option{--enable-shared} @minus{}@minus{} Build shared versions of the C++ runtime
libraries if supported. This is the default on most systems. Use @option{--disable-shared} 
for static libraries. Note that up to the gcc version 2.95.x series, static
libraries were the default on all systems.

@item
@option{--with-gnu-as} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the compiler should assume that the
assembler it finds is the GNU assembler. However, this does not modify the rules to find an
assembler and will result in confusion if found assembler is not actually the GNU assembler.
If you have more than one assembler installed on your system, you may want to use this option
in connection with @option{--with-as=/path/to/gas}.

@item
@option{--with-as=@emph{/path/to/as}} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the compiler should use the
assembler pointed to by @emph{pathname}, rather than the one found by the standard rules to
find an assembler, which are:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Check the @emph{$exec_prefix/lib/gcc-lib/$target/$version} directory, where @emph{$exec_prefix}
defaults to @emph{$prefix} which defaults to @file{/usr/local} unless overridden by the 
@option{--prefix=/pathname} switch described above. @emph{$target} is the target system triple, 
such as @emph{sparc-sun-solaris2.7}, and @emph{$version} denotes the GCC version, such as 2.95.2.
@item
Check operating system specific directories (e.g. @file{/usr/ccs/bin} on Sun Solaris).
@end itemize
Note that these rules do not check for the value of @emph{$PATH}. You may want to use 
@option{--with-as} if no assembler is installed in the directories listed above, or if you have
multiple assemblers installed and want to choose one that is not found by the above rules.

@item
@option{--with-gnu-ld} @minus{}@minus{} Same as @option{--with-gnu-as} but for linker. 

@item
@option{--with-ld=@emph{/path/to/ld}} @minus{}@minus{} Same as @option{--with-as}, but for the
linker.

@item
@option{--with-stabs} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that stabs debugging information should be used
instead of whatever format the host normally uses.  Normally GCC uses the
same debug format as the host system. 

@item
@option{--enable-multilib} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that multiple target libraries
should be built to support different target variants, calling conventions,
etc.  This is the default. 

@item
@option{--enable-threads} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the target supports threads.
This affects the Objective-C compiler and runtime library, and exception
handling for other languages like C++ and Java.

@item
@option{--enable-threads=}@emph{lib} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that @emph{lib} is the thread
support library.  This affects the Objective-C compiler and runtime library,
and exception handling for other languages like C++ and Java.

@item
@option{--with-cpu=}@emph{cpu} @minus{}@minus{} Specify which cpu variant the
compiler should generate code for by default.  This is currently
only supported on the some ports, specifically arm, powerpc, and
SPARC. If configure does not recognize the model name (e.g. arm700,
603e, or ultrasparc) you provide, please check the configure script
for a complete list of supported models.

@item
@option{--enable-target-optspace} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that target libraries
should  be optimized for code space instead of code speed.  This is the
default for the m32r platform.

@item
@option{--enable-cpp} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that a shell script which emulates
traditional cpp functionality should be installed.

@item
@option{--enable-cpplib} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the functionality of
CPP should be integrated into the compiler itself.  This option is
not supported by snapshots since November 2000.  In snapshots where
it is supported, it is not enabled by default, except for snapshots
very close to November 2000.

@item
@option{--without-fast-fixincludes} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the old, slower
method of fixing the system header files should be used. 
EGCS 1.1.x and older releases default to the slow version. GCC 2.95 and
newer releases will default to the fast version.

@item
@option{--enable-version-specific-runtime-libs} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that runtime
libraries should be installed in the compiler specific subdirectory
(@option{$@{libsubdir@}}) rather than the usual places.
In addition, libstdc++'s include files will be installed in
@option{$@{libsubdir@}/include/g++} unless you overruled it by using
@option{--with-gxx-include-dir=}@emph{dirname}.
Using this option is particularly useful if you intend to use several
versions of GCC in parallel. This is currently supported by @option{libf2c}
and @option{libstdc++}.

@item
@option{--enable-languages=}@emph{lang1}@option{,}@emph{lang2}@option{,...}
@minus{}@minus{} Specify that only a particular subset of compilers and their runtime libraries
should be built. For a list of valid values for @emph{lang}@option{x} you can issue
the following command in the @option{gcc} directory of your GCC source tree:@*
@command{grep language= */config-lang.in}@*
Currently, you can use any of the following: @code{c++}, @code{f77}, @code{java} and @code{objc}.
@code{CHILL} is not currently maintained, and will almost
certainly fail to compile.  Note that this switch does not work with
EGCS 1.1.2 or older versions of egcs.  It is supported in GCC 2.95
and newer versions.@*
If you do not pass this flag, all languages available in the @code{gcc} sub-tree
will be configured.  Re-defining LANGUAGES when calling @command{make bootstrap}
@strong{*does not*} work anymore, as those language sub-directories might not have been
configured!

@item
@option{--disable-libgcj} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the run-time libraries
used by GCJ should not be built.  This is useful in case you intend
to use GCJ with some other run-time, or you're going to install it
separately, or it just happens not to build on your particular
machine.  In general, if the Java front-end is enabled, the GCJ
libraries will be enabled too, unless they're known to not work on
the target platform.  If GCJ is enabled but libgcj isn't built, you
may need to port it; in this case, before modifying the top-level
configure.in so that libgcj is enabled by default on this platform,
you may use @option{--enable-libgcj} to override the default.

@item
@option{--with-dwarf2} @minus{}@minus{} Specify that the compiler should use DWARF2
debugging information as the default.
@end itemize

Some options which only apply to building cross compilers:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@option{--with-headers=}@emph{dir} @minus{}@minus{} Specifies a directory which has
target include files.
@emph{This options is required} when building a cross
compiler, if @code{$@{prefix@}/$@{target@}/sys-include} doesn't pre-exist.
These include files will be copied into the @code{gcc} install directory.
Fixincludes will be run on these files to make them compatible with @command{gcc}.
@item
@option{--with-libs=}@emph{``dir1 dir2 ... dirN''} @minus{}@minus{} Specifies a list of
directories which contain the target runtime libraries.  These libraries will
be copied into the @code{gcc} install directory.
@item
@option{--with-newlib} @minus{}@minus{} Specifies that ``newlib'' is being used as the target
C library.   This causes @code{__eprintf} to be omitted from libgcc.a on the
assumption that it will be provided by newlib.
@end itemize
 
Note that each @option{--enable} option has a corresponding @option{--disable} option and
that each @option{--with} option has a corresponding @option{--without} option.

@cindex Installing GCC: Building

Now that GCC is configured, you are ready to build the compiler and
runtime libraries.

We @strong{highly} recommend that GCC be built using GNU make;
other versions may work, then again they might not.

(For example, many broken versions of make will fail if you use the
recommended setup where @emph{objdir} is different from @emph{srcdir}.)


@section Building a native compiler

For a native build issue the command `@code{make bootstrap}'.  This 
will build the entire GCC system, which includes the following steps:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Build host tools necessary to build the compiler such as texinfo, bison,
gperf.

@item
Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes)@*
if they have been individually linked 
or moved into the top level GCC source tree before configuring.

@item
Perform a 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.

@item
Perform a comparison test of the stage2 and stage3 compilers.

@item
Build runtime libraries using the stage3 compiler from the previous step.
 
@end itemize

If you are short on disk space you might consider `@code{make
bootstrap-lean}' instead.  This is identical to `@code{make
bootstrap}' except that object files from the stage1 and
stage2 of the 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler are deleted as
soon as they are no longer needed.


If you want to save additional space during the bootstrap and in
the final installation as well, you can build the compiler binaries
without debugging information with ``@code{make CFLAGS='-O' LIBCFLAGS='-g
-O2' LIBCXXFLAGS='-g -O2 -fno-implicit-templates' bootstrap}''.  This will save
roughly 40% of disk space both for the bootstrap and the final installation.
(Libraries will still contain debugging information.)

If you used the flag @code{--enable-languages=...} to restrict
the compilers to be built, only those you've actually enabled will be
built. This will of course only build those runtime libraries, for
which the particular compiler has been built.  Please note,
that re-defining LANGUAGES when calling `@code{make bootstrap}'
@strong{*does not*} work anymore!


@section Building a cross compiler

We recommend reading the
@uref{http://www.objsw.com/CrossGCC/,,crossgcc FAQ}
for information about building cross compilers.

When building a cross compiler, it is not generally possible to do a
3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.  This makes for an interesting problem
as parts of GCC can only be built with GCC.

To build a cross compiler, we first recommend building and installing a
native compiler.  You can then use the native GCC compiler to build the
cross compiler.

Assuming you have already installed a native copy of GCC and configured
your cross compiler, issue the command `@code{make}', which performs the
following steps:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Build host tools necessary to build the compiler such as texinfo, bison,
gperf.

@item
Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes)
if they have been individually linked or moved into the top level GCC source
tree before configuring.

@item
Build the compiler (single stage only).

@item
Build runtime libraries using the compiler from the previous step.
@end itemize

Note that if an error occurs in any step the make process will exit.

@section Building in parallel

If you have a multiprocessor system you can use `@code{make bootstrap
MAKE="make -j 2" -j 2}' or just `@code{make -j 2 bootstrap}'
for GNU Make 3.79 and above instead of just `@code{make bootstrap}'
when building GCC.  You can use a bigger number instead of two if
you like.  In most cases, it won't help to use a number bigger than
the number of processors in your machine.

@cindex Installing GCC: Testing
@cindex Testsuite

@strong{Please note that this is only applicable 
to current development versions of GCC and GCC 3.0 or later. 
GCC 2.95.x does not come with a testsuite.}

Before you install GCC, you might wish to run the testsuite. This
step is optional and may require you to download additional software.

First, you must have @uref{download.html,,downloaded the testsuites}. 
The full distribution contains testsuites; only if you downloaded the 
``core'' compiler plus any front ends, you do not have the testsuites.

Second, you must have a @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/,,current version of DejaGnu} installed;
dejagnu 1.3 is not sufficient.

Now you may need specific preparations:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In order to run the libio tests on targets which do not fully
support Unix/POSIX commands (e.g. Cygwin), the references to the dbz
directory have to be deleted from @code{libio/configure.in}.

@item
The following environment variables must be set appropriately, as in
the following example (which assumes that DejaGnu has been installed
under @code{/usr/local}):

@example
     TCL_LIBRARY = /usr/local/share/tcl8.0
     DEJAGNULIBS = /usr/local/share/dejagnu
@end example

On systems such as Cygwin, these paths are required to be actual
paths, not mounts or links; presumably this is due to some lack of
portability in the DejaGnu code.

@end itemize

Finally, you can run the testsuite (which may take a long time):
@example
     cd @emph{objdir}; make -k check
@end example

The testing process will try to test as many components in the GCC
distribution as possible, including the C, C++ and Fortran compilers as
well as the C++ runtime libraries.

@section How can I run the test suite on selected tests?

As a first possibility to cut down the number of tests that are run it is
possible to use `@code{make check-gcc}' or `@code{make check-g++}'
in the gcc subdirectory of the object directory. To further cut down the
tests the following is possible:

@example
    make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp <other options>"
@end example

This will run all gcc execute tests in the testsuite.

@example
    make check-g++ RUNTESTFLAGS="old-deja.exp=9805* <other options>"
@end example

This will run the g++ "old-deja" tests in the testsuite where the filename
matches 9805*.

The *.exp files are located in the testsuite directories of the GCC
source, the most important ones being compile.exp, execute.exp, dg.exp
and old-deja.exp. To get a list of the possible *.exp files, pipe the
output of `@code{make check}' into a file and look at the
"@code{Running ...  .exp}" lines.

@section How to interpret test results

After the testsuite has run you'll find various *.sum and *.log
files in the testsuite subdirectories. The *.log files contain a
detailed log of the compiler invocations and the corresponding
results, the *.sum files summarize the results. These summaries list
all the tests that have been run with a corresponding status code:

@itemize @bullet
@item
PASS: the test passed as expected
@item
XPASS: the test unexpectedly passed
@item
FAIL: the test unexpectedly failed
@item
XFAIL: the test failed as expected
@item
UNSUPPORTED: the test is not supported on this platform
@item
ERROR: the testsuite detected an error
@item
WARNING: the testsuite detected a possible problem
@end itemize

It is normal for some tests to report unexpected failures.  At the current time 
our testing harness does not allow fine grained control over whether or not a 
test is expected to fail.  We expect to fix this problem in future releases.


@section Submitting test results

If you want to report the results to the GCC project, use the
@code{contrib/test_summary} shell script. Start it in the @emph{objdir} with

@example
    @emph{srcdir}/contrib/test_summary -p your_commentary.txt -m gcc-testresults@@gcc.gnu.org |sh
@end example

This script uses the @code{Mail} program to send the results, so
make sure it is in your @env{PATH}. The file @file{your_commentary.txt} is
prepended to the testsuite summary and should contain any special
remarks you have on your results or your build environment. Please
do not edit the testsuite result block or the subject line, as these
messages are automatically parsed and presented at the 
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/testresults/,,GCC testresults} web
page.  Here you can also gather information on how specific tests
behave on different platforms and compare them with your results. A
few failing testcases are possible even on released versions and you
should look here first if you think your results are unreasonable.

Now that GCC has been built and tested, you can install it with
`@command{cd @emph{objdir}; make install}' for a native compiler or
`@command{cd @emph{objdir}; make install LANGUAGES="c c++"}' for 
a cross compiler (note installing cross compilers will be easier in the 
next release!).

That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
be found in @code{@emph{prefix}/bin} where @code{@emph{prefix}} is the value you specified
with the @option{--prefix} to configure (or @file{/usr/local} by default).

If you don't mind, please quickly review the 
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/buildstat.html,,build status page}.
If your system is not listed, send a note to
@uref{mailto:gcc@@gcc.gnu.org,,gcc@@gcc.gnu.org} indicating
that you successfully built and installed GCC.

Include the output from running @code{@emph{srcdir}/config.guess}.  (Do not

it!)

We are often asked about pre-compiled versions of GCC. While we cannot
provide these for all platforms, below you'll find links to binaries for
various platforms where creating them by yourself is not easy due to various
reasons.

Please note that we did not create these binaries, nor do we
support them.  If you have any problems installing them, please
contact their makers.

We require binutils 2.11 or newer.  Previous binutils releases
had a number of problems with DWARF2 debugging information, not
the least of which is incorrect linking of shared libraries.

@html

If you install a shared libstdc++ and, when you link a non-trivial C++
program (for example, @code{gcc/testsuite/g++.other/delete3.C}),
the linker reports a couple of errors about multiply-defined symbols
(for example, @code{nothrow}, @code{__throw} and
@code{terminate(void)}), you've probably got a linker bug, for
which there's no known fix.  The officially recommended work-around is
to remove the shared libstdc++.

An alternative solution is to arrange that all symbols from
@code{libgcc} get copied to the shared @code{libstdc++};
see detailed solution below.  (Surprising as it may seem, this does
indeed fix the problem!)  @emph{Beware} that this may bring you
binary-compatibility problems in the future, if you don't use the same
work-around next time you build @code{libstdc++}: if programs
start to depend on @code{libstdc++} to provide symbols that used
to be only in @code{libgcc}, you must arrange that
@code{libstdc++} keeps providing them, otherwise the programs
will have to be relinked.

The magic spell is to add @code{-Wl,-all,-lgcc,-none} to the
definition of macro @code{SHDEPS} in
@code{libstdc++/config/dec-osf.ml} @emph{before}
@code{alpha*-dec-osf*/libstdc++/Makefile} is created (a 
@uref{dec-osf-shlibstdc++.patch,,patch} 
that does just that is available).  If the Makefile already exists, run
@code{./config.status} within directory
@code{alpha*-dec-osf*/libstdc++} (and
@code{alpha*-dec-osf*/ieee/libstdc++}, if it also exists).
Remove any existing @code{libstdc++.so*} from such directories,
and run @code{make all-target-libstdc++} in the top-level
directory, then @code{make install-target-libstdc++}.

If you have already removed the build tree, you may just remove
@code{libstdc++.so.2.10.0} from the install tree and re-create
it with the command 
@code{gcc -shared -o libstdc++.so.2.10.0 -Wl,-all,-lstdc++,-lgcc,-none -lm}.
If the @code{ieee}
sub-directory exists, repeat this command in it, with the additional
flag @code{-mieee}.

We @emph{highly} recommend using gas/binutils-2.8 or newer on all hppa
platforms; you may encounter a variety of problems when using the HP 
assembler.

Specifically, @option{-g} does not work on HP-UX (since that system
uses a peculiar debugging format which GCC does not know about), unless you
use GAS and GDB and configure GCC with the @option{--with-gnu-as}
option.

If you wish to use pa-risc 2.0 architecture support, you must use either
the HP assembler or a recent
@uref{ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/snapshots,,snapshot of gas}.

More specific information to hppa*-hp-hpux* targets follows.

The HP assembler has major problems on this platform.  We've tried to work
around the worst of the problems.  However, those workarounds may be causing
linker crashes in some circumstances; the workarounds also probably prevent
shared libraries from working.  Use the GNU assembler to avoid these problems.


The configuration scripts for GCC will also trigger a bug in the hpux9
shell.  To avoid this problem set CONFIG_SHELL to @file{/bin/ksh} and SHELL 
to @file{/bin/ksh} in your environment.

The HP assembler on these systems is much better than the hpux9 assembler,
but still has some problems.  Most notably the assembler inserts timestamps
into each object file it creates, causing the 3-stage comparison test to fail
during a `@code{make bootstrap}'.  You should be able to continue by 
saying `@code{make all}' after getting the failure from `@code{make 
bootstrap}'.

Unlike earlier versions of GCC, the ability to generate COFF with this
target is no longer provided.

Earlier versions of GCC emitted Dwarf-1 when generating ELF to allow
the system debugger to be used.  That support was too burdensome to
maintain.  GCC now emits only dwarf-2 for this target.  This means you
may use either the UDK debugger or GDB to debug programs built by this
version of GCC.

If you are building languages other than C, you must follow the instructions
about invoking `@code{make bootstrap}' because the native OpenServer
compiler will build a @code{cc1plus} that will not correctly parse many
valid C++ programs including those in @code{libgcc.a}.  
@strong{You must do a `@code{make bootstrap}' if you are building with the 
native compiler.}

Use of the `@option{-march-pentiumpro}' flag can result in
unrecognized opcodes when using the native assembler on OS versions before
5.0.6. (Support for P6 opcodes was added to the native ELF assembler in
that version.)  While it's rather rare to see these emitted by GCC yet, 
errors of the basic form:

@example
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:22:unknown instruction: fcomip
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:50:unknown instruction: fucomip
@end example

are symptoms of this problem.  You may work around this by not
building affected files with that flag, by using the GNU assembler, or
by using the assembler provided with the current version of the OS.
Users of GNU assembler should see the note below for hazards on doing
so.

The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no
charge is normally required.  If, however, you must be able to use
the GNU assembler (perhaps you're compiling code with asms that
require GAS syntax) you may configure this package using the flags
@option{--with-gnu-as}.  You must use a recent version of GNU
binutils; versions past 2.9.1 seem to work well.

In general, the @option{--with-gnu-as} option isn't as well tested
as the native assembler.

Look in @file{gcc/config/i386/sco5.h} (search for "messy") for
additional OpenServer-specific flags.

Systems based on OpenServer before 5.0.4 (`@code{uname -X}'
will tell you what you're running) require TLS597 from ftp.sco.com/TLS
for C++ constructors and destructors to work right.

The system linker in (at least) 5.0.4 and 5.0.5 will sometimes
do the wrong thing for a construct that GCC will emit for PIC
code.  This can be seen as execution testsuite failures when using
-fPIC on 921215-1.c, 931002-1.c, nestfunc-1.c, and gcov-1.c.
For 5.0.5, an updated linker that will cure this problem is
available.  You must install both 
@uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/,,ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/} 
and @uref{ftp://ftp.sco.com/SLS/,,OSS499A}.

The dynamic linker in OpenServer 5.0.5 (earlier versions may show
the same problem) aborts on certain g77-compiled programs.  It's particularly
likely to be triggered by building Fortran code with the @option{-fPIC} flag.
Although it's conceivable that the error could be triggered by other
code, only G77-compiled code has been observed to cause this abort.
If you are getting core dumps immediately upon execution of your
g77 program - and especially if it's compiled with -fPIC - try applying
@uref{sco_osr5_g77.patch,,@code{`sco_osr5_g77.patch'}} to your libf2c and 
rebuilding GCC.  
Affected faults, when analyzed in a debugger, will show a stack
backtrace with a fault occurring in @code{rtld()} and the program
running as @code{/usr/lib/ld.so.1}.  This problem has been reported to SCO 
engineering and will hopefully be addressed in later releases.

This target emulates the SCO Universal Development Kit and requires that
package be installed.  (If it is installed, you will have a 
@file{/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc } file present.)  It's very much like the 
@code{i?86-*-unixware7*} target
but is meant to be used when hosting on a system where UDK isn't the
default compiler such as OpenServer 5 or Unixware 2.  This target will
generate binaries that will run on OpenServer, Unixware 2, or Unixware 7, 
with the same warnings and caveats as the SCO UDK.

You can stage1 with either your native compiler or with UDK.   If you
don't do a full bootstrap when initially building with your native compiler
you will have an utterly unusable pile of bits as your reward.

This target is a little tricky to build because we have to distinguish
it from the native tools (so it gets headers, startups, and libraries
from the right place) while making the tools not think we're actually 
building a cross compiler.   The easiest way to do this is with a configure
command like this:

@command{  CC=/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc <i>/your/path/to/</i>gcc/configure 
--host=i686-pc-udk --target=i686-pc-udk --program-prefix=udk-}

@emph{You should substitute 'i686' in the above command with the appropriate
processor for your host.}

You should follow this with a `@command{make bootstrap}'  then
`@command{make install}'.  You can then access the UDK-targeted GCC 
tools by adding @code{udk-} before the commonly known name.  For example, to 
invoke the C compiler, you would use `@code{udk-gcc}'.  They will coexist 
peacefully with any native-target GCC tools you may have installed.

@end html

AIX Make frequently has problems with GCC makefiles.  GNU Make 3.76 or
newer is recommended to build on this platform.

Errors involving "alloca" when building GCC generally are due
to an incorrect definition of @command{CC} in the Makefile or mixing files
compiled with the native C compiler and GCC.  During the stage1 phase of
the build, the native AIX compiler @strong{must} be invoked as "cc"
(not "xlc").  Once @command{configure} has been informed of
"xlc", one needs to use "make distclean" to remove the
configure cache files and ensure that @command{CC} environment variable
does not provide a definition that will confuse @command{configure}.
If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the problem most likely
is the version of Make (see above).

Binutils 2.10 does not support AIX 4.3.  Binutils available from the
@uref{http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/,,AIX Toolbox for Linux: GNU and Open Source tools for AIX};
website does work.  Binutils 2.11 is expected to include AIX 4.3
support.  The GNU Assembler is necessary for libstdc++ to build.  The
AIX native ld still is recommended.  The native AIX tools do
interoperate with GCC.

Linking executables and shared libraries may produce warnings of
duplicate symbols.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always
have included multiple symbol definitions for certain global variable
and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings should
not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.

AIX 4.3 utilizes a "large format" archive to support both 32-bit and
64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1
to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly.
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during
linking such as "not a COFF file".  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The @option{-g}
option of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit
objects using the original "small format".  A correct version of the
routines is shipped with AIX 4.3.2.

Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
overflow severe error when the @option{-bbigtoc} option is used to link
GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC.  A fix
for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND -BBIGTOC) is
available from IBM Customer Support and from its
@uref{http://service.boulder.ibm.com/,,service.boulder.ibm.com}
website as PTF U455193.

The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump core
with a segmentation fault when invoked by any version of GCC.  A fix for
APAR IX87327 is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
@uref{http://service.boulder.ibm.com/,,service.boulder.ibm.com}
website as PTF U461879.  This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.3 and above.

The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect object
files.  A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUTPUT FROM COMPILER FAILS
TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
@uref{http://service.boulder.ibm.com/,,service.boulder.ibm.com}
website as PTF U453956.  This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.

AIX provides National Language Support (NLS).  Compilers and assemblers
use NLS to support locale-specific representations of various data
formats including floating-point numbers (e.g., "."  vs "," for
separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems reported where
GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler
expects.  If one encouters this problem, set the @command{LANG}
environment variable to "C" or "En_US".

You absolutely @strong{must} use GNU sed and GNU make on this platform.


On NEXTSTEP 3.x where x < 3 the build of GCC will abort during  
stage1 with an error message like this:

@example
  _eh
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Unknown pseudo-op: .section
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character
  valued 95 (_).
@end example

The reason for this is the fact that NeXT's assembler for these  
versions of the operating system does not support the .section  
pseudo op that's needed for full C++ exception functionality.

As NeXT's assembler is a derived work from GNU as, a free  
replacement that does can be obtained at 
@uref{ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s.tar.gz,,ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s.tar.gz}.

If you try to build the integrated C++ & C++ runtime libraries on this system
you will run into trouble with include files.  The way to get around this is
to use the following sequence.  Note you must have write permission to
the directory @emph{prefix} you specified in the configuration process of GCC
for this sequence to work.

  cd bld-gcc
  make all-texinfo all-bison all-byacc all-binutils all-gas all-ld

These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in GCC need; you
should be able to avoid this problem by installing GNU binutils, which includes
a functional ranlib for this system.

You may get the following warning on irix4 platforms, it can be safely
ignored.

over again.  This happens on mips-sgi-irix5.2, and possibly other platforms.@*
It has been reported that this is a known bug in the make shipped with
IRIX 5.2.  We recommend you use GNU make instead of the vendor supplied
make program; however, you may have success with "smake" on IRIX 5.2 if
you do not have GNU make available.

See @uref{http://freeware.sgi.com/,,http://freeware.sgi.com/} for more
information about using GCC on IRIX platforms.

You must @emph{not} use GAS on irix6 platforms; doing so will only
cause problems.

These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in GCC need; you
should be able to avoid this problem by making a dummy script called ranlib
which just exits with zero status and placing it in your path.

If you are using Irix cc as your bootstrap compiler, you must
ensure that the N32 ABI is in use.  To test this, compile a simple C
file with @command{cc} and then run @command{file} on the
resulting object file.  The output should look like:

@example
@code{    test.o: ELF N32 MSB ...}
@end example

If you see:
@example
@code{    test.o: ELF 32-bit MSB}
@end example

then your version of @command{cc} uses the O32 ABI default.  You
should set the environment variable @command{CC} to 'cc -n32'
before configuring GCC.

GCC does not currently support generating O32 ABI binaries in the
mips-sgi-irix6 configurations.  It used to be possible to create a GCC
with O32 ABI only support by configuring it for the mips-sgi-irix5
target.  See the link below for details.

GCC does not correctly pass/return structures which are
smaller than 16 bytes and which are not 8 bytes. The problem is very
involved and difficult to fix. It affects a number of other targets also,
but IRIX 6 is affected the most, because it is a 64 bit target, and 4 byte
structures are common. The exact problem is that structures are being padded
at the wrong end, e.g. a 4 byte structure is loaded into the lower 4 bytes
of the register when it should be loaded into the upper 4 bytes of the
register.

GCC is consistent with itself, but not consistent with the SGI C compiler
(and the SGI supplied runtime libraries), so the only failures that can
happen are when there are library functions that take/return such
structures. There are very few such library functions. I can only recall
seeing two of them: inet_ntoa, and semctl.

See @uref{http://freeware.sgi.com/,,http://freeware.sgi.com/} for more
information about using GCC on IRIX platforms.

Starting with Solaris, Sun does not ship a C compiler any more. To
bootstrap and install GCC you first have to install a pre-built
compiler, see our @uref{binaries.html,,binaries page} for
details.

You must use GNU Make to build GCC on Solaris 2.  If you don't have GNU
Make installed, you can use the prebuilt compiler mentioned above to
build it.

Sun as 4.X is broken in that it cannot cope with long symbol names.
A typical error message might look similar to the following:

@samp{/usr/ccs/bin/as: "/var/tmp/ccMsw135.s", line 11041: 
error: can't compute value of an expression involving an external symbol.}

This is Sun bug 4237974.  This is fixed with patch 108908-02 and has
been fixed in later (5.x) versions of the assembler.

binutils 2.9.1 has known bugs on this platform. We recommend to use
binutils 2.10 or the vendor tools (Sun as, Sun ld).

Unfortunately, C++ shared libraries, including libstdc++, won't work
properly if assembled with Sun as: the linker will complain about
relocations in read-only sections, in the definition of virtual
tables. Also, Sun as fails to process long symbols resulting from
mangling template-heavy C++ function names.

Sun patch 107058-01 (1999-01-13) for SPARC Solaris 7 triggers a bug in
the dynamic linker.  This problem (Sun bug 4210064) affects GCC 2.8
and later, including all EGCS releases.  Sun formerly recommended
107058-01 for all Solaris 7 users, but around 1999-09-01 it started to
recommend it only for people who use Sun's compilers.
  
Here are some workarounds to this problem:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Do not install Sun patch 107058-01 until after Sun releases a
complete patch for bug 4210064.  This is the simplest course to take,
unless you must also use Sun's C compiler.  Unfortunately 107058-01
is preinstalled on some new Solaris-based hosts, so you may have to
back it out.
  
@item
Copy the original, unpatched Solaris 7
@command{/usr/ccs/bin/as} into
@command{/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.95.1/as},
adjusting the latter name to fit your local conventions and software
version numbers.

@item
Install Sun patch 106950-03 (1999-05-25) or later.  Nobody with
both 107058-01 and 106950-03 installed has reported the bug with GCC
and Sun's dynamic linker.  This last course of action is riskiest,
for two reasons.  First, you must install 106950 on all hosts that
run code generated by GCC; it doesn't suffice to install it only on
the hosts that run GCC itself.  Second, Sun says that 106950-03 is
only a partial fix for bug 4210064, but Sun doesn't know whether the
partial fix is adequate for GCC.  Revision -08 or later should fix
the bug, but (as of 1999-10-06) it is still being tested.

<!-- ripped from the same FAQ that I answered -->
@end html

Sun bug 4296832 turns up when compiling X11 headers with GCC 2.95 or
newer:  g++ will complain that types are missing.  These headers assume
that omitting the type means 'int'; this assumption worked for C89 but
is wrong for C++, and is now wrong for C99 also.

g++ accepts such (illegal) constructs with the option @option{-fpermissive}; it
will assume that any missing type is 'int' (as defined by C89).

For Solaris 8, this is fixed by revision 24 or later of patch 108652
(for SPARCs) or 108653 (for Intels).

A bug in the SunOS4 linker will cause it to crash when linking
-fPIC compiled objects (and will therefore not allow you to build
shared libraries).

To fix this problem you can either use the most recent version of
binutils or get the latest SunOS4 linker patch (patch ID 100170-10)
from Sun's patch site.

<h3><a name="older"></a>Older systems</h3> 
@end html
 
GCC contains support files for many older (1980s and early 
1990s) Unix variants.  For the most part, support for these systems 
has not been deliberately removed, but it has not been maintained for 
several years and may suffer from bitrot.  Support from some systems 
has been removed from GCC 3: fx80, ns32-ns-genix, pyramid, tahoe, 
gmicro, spur; most of these targets had not been updated since GCC 
version 1.
 
Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less 
problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an enthusiast 
wishes to make such a target work again (including resurrecting any 
of the targets that never worked with GCC 2, starting from the last 
CVS version before they were removed), patches 
@uref{../contribute.html,,following the usual requirements} 
would be likely to be accepted, since they should not affect the 
support for more modern targets.
 
Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the 
workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the 
cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC.  In some cases, to 
bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may 
require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that 
system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in 
the vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in 
the old-releases directory on the 
@uref{../mirrors.html,,GCC mirror sites}.  Header bugs may generally 
be avoided using @code{fixincludes}, but bugs or deficiencies in libraries and 
the operating system may still cause problems.
 
For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful, 
and are available from pub/binutils/old-releases on 
@uref{http://sources.redhat.com/mirrors.html,,sources.redhat.com mirror sites}.
 
Some of the information on specific systems above relates to 
such older systems, but much of the information 
about GCC on such systems (which may no longer be applicable to 
current GCC) is to be found in the GCC texinfo manual.
