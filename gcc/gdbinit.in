define pr
set debug_rtx ($)
end

document pr
Print the full structure of the rtx that is $.
Works only when an inferior is executing.
end

define prl
set debug_rtx_list ($, debug_rtx_count)
end

document prl
Print the full structure of all rtx insns beginning at $.
Works only when an inferior is executing.
Uses variable debug_rtx_count to control number of insns printed:
  debug_rtx_count > 0: print from $ on.
  debug_rtx_count < 0: print a window around $.

There is also debug_rtx_find (rtx, uid) that will scan a list for UID and print
it using debug_rtx_list. Usage example: set $foo=debug_rtx_find(first, 42)
end

set debug_tree ($)
end

document pt
Print the full structure of the tree that is $.
Works only when an inferior is executing.
end

define pct

document pct
Print the tree that is $ in C syntax.
Works only when an inferior is executing.

Print the Gimple sequence that is $ in C syntax.
Works only when an inferior is executing.
