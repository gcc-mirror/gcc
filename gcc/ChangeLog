2007-01-02  Douglas Gregor  <doug.gregor@gmail.com>

	* c-common.c(c_common_nodes_and_builtins): Since variants of

	own canonical type.
	(build_type_attribute_qual_variant): When building an attribute
	variant, its canonical type is the non-attribute variant. However,

	unqualified variant; set the canonical type appropriately.
	(build_distinct_type_copy): When building a distinct type from

	because its maximum value is negative), the index type requires
	structural equality tests.
	(build_array_type): Build the canonical form of an array type.
	(build_function_type): Function types require structural equality,
	because they contain default arguments, attributes, etc. 
	(build_method_type_directly): Ditto for method types.
