   DEF_BUILTIN(NAME, N_ARGS, ID, TYPE, ICODE)

   NAME:   The name as visible by the user as a C string.
   ID:     An integer to identify the built-in.
   N_ARGS: Number of input arguments.  If special treatment is needed,
           set to -1 and handle it by hand, see avr.c:avr_expand_builtin().
   TYPE:   A tree node describing the prototype of the built-in.
   ICODE:  Insn code number for the insn attached to the built-in.
           If special treatment is needed to expand the built-in, set to -1.
