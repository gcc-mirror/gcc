/* This avr-specific pass (re)computes insn notes, in particular REG_DEAD
   notes which are used by `avr.c::reg_unused_after' and branch offset
   computations.  These notes must be correct, i.e. there must be no
   dangling REG_DEAD notes; otherwise wrong code might result, cf. PR64331.

   DF needs (correct) CFG, hence right before free_cfg is the last
   opportunity to rectify notes.  */
