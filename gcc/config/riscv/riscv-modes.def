/* TODO: According to RISC-V 'V' ISA spec, the maximun vector length can
   be 65536 for a single vector register which means the vector mode in
   GCC can be maximum = 65536 * 8 bits (LMUL=8).
   However, 'GET_MODE_SIZE' is using poly_uint16/unsigned short which will
   overflow if we specify vector-length = 65536. To support this feature,
   we need to change the codes outside the RISC-V port. We will support it in
   the future.  */
