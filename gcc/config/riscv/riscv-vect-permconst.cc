   replace a memory load from the constant pool with a vadd.vi

   Conceptually this is much like the related_values optimization in
   CSE, reload_cse_move2add or using SLSR to optimize constant synthesis.
   If we wanted to make this generic I would suggest putting it into CSE
   and providing target hooks to determine if particular permutation
