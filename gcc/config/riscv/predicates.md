  /* The thinking here is as follows:

     (1) The move expanders should split complex load sequences into
	 individual instructions.  Those individual instructions can
	 then be optimized by all rtl passes.

     (2) The target of pre-reload load sequences should not be used
	 to store temporary results.  If the target register is only
	 assigned one value, reload can rematerialize that value
	 on demand, rather than spill it to the stack.

     (3) If we allowed pre-reload passes like combine and cse to recreate
	 complex load sequences, we would want to be able to split the
	 sequences before reload as well, so that the pre-reload scheduler
	 can see the individual instructions.  This falls foul of (2);
	 the splitter would be forced to reuse the target register for
	 intermediate results.

     (4) We want to define complex load splitters for combine.  These
	 splitters can request a temporary scratch register, which avoids
	 the problem in (2).  They allow things like:

	      (set (reg T1) (high SYM))
	      (set (reg T2) (low (reg T1) SYM))
	      (set (reg X) (plus (reg T2) (const_int OFFSET)))

	 to be combined into:

	      (set (reg T3) (high SYM+OFFSET))
	      (set (reg X) (lo_sum (reg T3) SYM+OFFSET))

	 if T2 is only used this once.  */
