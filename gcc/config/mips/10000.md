;; R12K/R14K/R16K are derivatives of R10K, thus copy its description
;; until specific tuning for each is added.

;; R10000 has an int queue, fp queue, address queue.
;; The int queue feeds ALU1 and ALU2.
;; The fp queue feeds the fp-adder and fp-multiplier.
;; The addr queue feeds the Load/Store unit.
;;
;; However, we define the fp-adder and fp-multiplier as
;; separate automatons, because the fp-multiplier is
;; divided into fp-multiplier, fp-division, and
;; fp-squareroot units, all of which share the same
;; issue and completion logic, yet can operate in
;; parallel.
;;
;; This is based on the model described in the R10K Manual
;; and it helps to reduce the size of the automata.
