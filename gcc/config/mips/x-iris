# will succeed (if OLDCC != CC, it is assumed that GCC is
# being used in secondary stage builds).  We need to pass
# the -Wf,-XNg1500 option so the compiler can compile the
# G++ file cp-parse.c.  Otherwise it complains about
# too many case statements.  -Olimit is so the user
# can use -O2.  Down with fixed size tables!
# The -cckr is to turn off strict ANSI checking.
