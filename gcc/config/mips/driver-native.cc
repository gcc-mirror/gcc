/* This will be called by the spec parser in gcc.cc when it sees
   a %:local_cpu_detect(args) construct.  Currently it will be called
   with either "arch" or "tune" as argument depending on if -march=native
   or -mtune=native is to be substituted.

   It returns a string containing new command line parameters to be
   put at the place of the above two options, depending on what CPU
   this is executed.  E.g. "-march=loongson2f" on a Loongson 2F for
   -march=native.  If the routine can't detect a known processor,
   the -march or -mtune option is discarded.

   ARGC and ARGV are set depending on the actual arguments given
   in the spec.  */
