/* Run-time Target Specification */

/* TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS() This function-like macro expands to a
   block of code that defines built-in preprocessor macros and
   assertions for the target cpu, using the functions builtin_define,
   builtin_define_std and builtin_assert. When the front end calls
   this macro it provides a trailing semicolon, and since it has
   finished command line option processing your code can use those
   results freely.  builtin_assert takes a string in the form you pass
   to the command-line option -A, such as cpu=mips, and creates the
   assertion. builtin_define takes a string in the form accepted by
   option -D and unconditionally defines the macro.

   builtin_define_std takes a string representing the name of an
   object-like macro. If it doesn't lie in the user's namespace,
   builtin_define_std defines it unconditionally. Otherwise, it
   defines a version with two leading underscores, and another version
   with two leading and trailing underscores, and defines the original
   only if an ISO standard was not requested on the command line. For
   example, passing unix defines __unix, __unix__ and possibly unix;
   passing _mips defines __mips, __mips__ and possibly _mips, and
   passing _ABI64 defines only _ABI64.

   You can also test for the C dialect being compiled. The variable
   c_language is set to one of clk_c, clk_cplusplus or
   clk_objective_c. Note that if we are preprocessing assembler, this
   variable will be clk_c but the function-like macro
   preprocessing_asm_p() will return true, so you might want to check
   for that first.  If you need to check for strict ANSI, the variable
   flag_iso can be used. The function-like macro
   preprocessing_trad_p() can be used to check for traditional
   preprocessing.  */

/* Defining data structures for per-function information.

   If the target needs to store information on a per-function basis,
   GCC provides a macro and a couple of variables to allow this. Note,
   just using statics to store the information is a bad idea, since
   GCC supports nested functions, so you can be halfway through
   encoding one function when another one comes along.

   GCC defines a data structure called struct function which contains
   all of the data specific to an individual function. This structure
   contains a field called machine whose type is struct
   machine_function *, which can be used by targets to point to their
   own specific data.

   If a target needs per-function specific data it should define the
   type struct machine_function and also the macro
   INIT_EXPANDERS. This macro should be used to initialize the
   function pointer init_machine_status.  This pointer is explained
   below.

   One typical use of per-function, target specific data is to create
   an RTX to hold the register containing the function's return
   address.  This RTX can then be used to implement the
   __builtin_return_address function, for level 0.

   Note--earlier implementations of GCC used a single data area to
   hold all of the per-function information. Thus when processing of a
   nested function began the old per-function data had to be pushed
   onto a stack, and when the processing was finished, it had to be
   popped off the stack.  GCC used to provide function pointers called
   save_machine_status and restore_machine_status to handle the saving
   and restoring of the target specific information. Since the single
   data area approach is no longer used, these pointers are no longer
   supported.

   The macro and function pointers are described below. 

   INIT_EXPANDERS:

   Macro called to initialize any target specific information. This
   macro is called once per function, before generation of any RTL has
   begun.  The intention of this macro is to allow the initialization
   of the function pointers below.

   init_machine_status:
   This is a void (*)(struct function *) function pointer. If this
   pointer is non-NULL it will be called once per function, before
   function compilation starts, in order to allow the target to
   perform any target specific initialization of the struct function
   structure. It is intended that this would be used to initialize the
   machine of that structure.  struct machine_function structures are
   expected to be freed by GC.  Generally, any memory that they
   reference must be allocated by using ggc_alloc, including the
   structure itself. */

/* Storage Layout

   Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are
   sizes or alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.

   the `target_flags'.

   `BITS_BIG_ENDIAN'

   Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit
   in a byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the
   value zero.  This means that bit-field instructions count from the
   most significant bit.  If the machine has no bit-field
   instructions, then this must still be defined, but it doesn't
   matter which value it is defined to.  This macro need not be a
   constant.

/* Trampolines for Nested Functions

   A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time
   when the address of a nested function is taken. It normally resides
   on the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function. These
   macros tell GCC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
   trampoline.

   The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a
   constant address into the static chain register, and jump to the
   real address of the nested function. On CISC machines such as the
   m68k, this requires two instructions, a move immediate and a
   jump. Then the two addresses exist in the trampoline as word-long
   immediate operands. On RISC machines, it is often necessary to load
   each address into a register in two parts. Then pieces of each
   address form separate immediate operands.

   The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the
   variable parts--the static chain value and the function
   address--into the immediate operands of the instructions. On a CISC
   machine, this is simply a matter of copying each address to a
   memory reference at the proper offset from the start of the
   trampoline. On a RISC machine, it may be necessary to take out
   pieces of the address and store them separately.

   On the Visium, the trampoline is

	moviu	r9,%u FUNCTION
	movil	r9,%l FUNCTION
	moviu	r20,%u STATIC
	bra	tr,r9,r0
	movil	r20,%l STATIC

/* Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)

   An object file is divided into sections containing different types
   of data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the
   "text section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the
   "data section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss
   section", which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other
   kinds of sections.

   `TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP'

   A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
   operation that should precede instructions and read-only data.
   Normally `".text"' is right. */
#define TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP "\t.text"

/* `DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'

   A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
   operation to identify the following data as writable initialized
   data.  Normally `".data"' is right. */

/* `BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'

   If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
   assembler operation to identify the following data as uninitialized
   global data.  If not defined, and neither `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' nor
   `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are defined, uninitialized global data
   will be output in the data section if `-fno-common' is passed,
   otherwise `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' will be used.

   `EXTRA_SECTIONS'

   A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
   `in_text' and `in_data'.  You need not define this macro on a
   system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).

   `EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS'

   One or more functions to be defined in `varasm.c'.  These functions
   should do jobs analogous to those of `text_section' and
   `data_section', for your additional sections.  Do not define this
   macro if you do not define `EXTRA_SECTIONS'.

   `JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION' Define this macro if jump tables (for
   `tablejump' insns) should be output in the text section, along with
   the assembler instructions.  Otherwise, the readonly data section
   is used.

   This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
   section. */
