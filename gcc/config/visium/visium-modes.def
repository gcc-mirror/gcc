/* Add any extra modes needed to represent the condition code.

   We have a CCNZ mode which is used for implicit comparisons with zero when
   arithmetic instructions set the condition code.  Only the N and Z flags
   are valid in this mode, which means that only the =,!= and <,>= operators
   can be used in conjunction with it.

   We also have a CCCmode which is used by the arithmetic instructions when
   they explicitly set the C flag (unsigned overflow) and by the bit-test
   instruction.  Only the =,!= and unsigned <,>= operators can be used in
   conjunction with it.

   We also have two modes to indicate that the condition code is set by the
   the floating-point unit.  One for comparisons which generate an exception
   if the result is unordered (CCFPEmode) and one for comparisons which never
   generate such an exception (CCFPmode).  */
