/* Add any extra modes needed to represent the condition code.

   For the i386, we need separate modes when floating-point
   equality comparisons are being done.

   Add CCNO to indicate comparisons against zero that requires
   Overflow flag to be unset.  Sign bit test is used instead and
   thus can be used to form "a&b>0" type of tests.

   Add CCGC to indicate comparisons against zero that allows
   unspecified garbage in the Carry flag.  This mode is used
   by inc/dec instructions.

   Add CCGOC to indicate comparisons against zero that allows
   unspecified garbage in the Carry and Overflow flag. This
   mode is used to simulate comparisons of (a-b) and (a+b)
   against zero using sub/cmp/add operations.

   Add CCA to indicate that only the Above flag is valid.
   Add CCC to indicate that only the Carry flag is valid.
   Add CCO to indicate that only the Overflow flag is valid.
   Add CCS to indicate that only the Sign flag is valid.
   Add CCZ to indicate that only the Zero flag is valid.  */
