# MSYS will zealously translate all paths to Windows form, so /usr/include becomes c:/msysX/usr/include.
# This is undesirable when TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT is specified, so this function converts /usr/include to //usr\include,
# which will become /usr/include again when passed to gcc.

# This function takes two parameters: first parameter is include directory path, second parameter tells
# if the path is relative to TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT.
# If TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT is not configured, or
#   this function always expands to the unmodified first parameter
# if TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT is configured, but second parameter is not 1,
#   this function again expands to the unmodified first parameter
# otherwise,
#  it expands to a shell expression which will transform the first parameter as described above.
