/* Define the register numbers to be used in Dwarf debugging information.
   The SVR4 reference port C compiler uses the following register numbers
   in its Dwarf output code:
	0 for %eax (gnu regno = 0)
	1 for %ecx (gnu regno = 2)
	2 for %edx (gnu regno = 1)
	3 for %ebx (gnu regno = 3)
	4 for %esp (gnu regno = 7)
	5 for %ebp (gnu regno = 6)
	6 for %esi (gnu regno = 4)
	7 for %edi (gnu regno = 5)
   The following three DWARF register numbers are never generated by
   the SVR4 C compiler or by the GNU compilers, but SDB on x86/svr4
   believes these numbers have these meanings.
	8  for %eip    (no gnu equivalent)
	9  for %eflags (no gnu equivalent)
	10 for %trapno (no gnu equivalent)
   It is not at all clear how we should number the FP stack registers
   for the x86 architecture.  If the version of SDB on x86/svr4 were
   a bit less brain dead with respect to floating-point then we would
   have a precedent to follow with respect to DWARF register numbers
   for x86 FP registers, but the SDB on x86/svr4 is so completely
   broken with respect to FP registers that it is hardly worth thinking
   of it as something to strive for compatibility with.
   The version of x86/svr4 SDB I have at the moment does (partially)
   seem to believe that DWARF register number 11 is associated with
   the x86 register %st(0), but that's about all.  Higher DWARF
   register numbers don't seem to be associated with anything in
   particular, and even for DWARF regno 11, SDB only seems to under-
   stand that it should say that a variable lives in %st(0) (when
   asked via an `=' command) if we said it was in DWARF regno 11,
   but SDB still prints garbage when asked for the value of the
   variable in question (via a `/' command).
   (Also note that the labels SDB prints for various FP stack regs
   when doing an `x' command are all wrong.)
   Note that these problems generally don't affect the native SVR4
   C compiler because it doesn't allow the use of -O with -g and
   because when it is *not* optimizing, it allocates a memory
   location for each floating-point variable, and the memory
   location is what gets described in the DWARF AT_location
   attribute for the variable in question.
   Regardless of the severe mental illness of the x86/svr4 SDB, we
   do something sensible here and we use the following DWARF
   register numbers.  Note that these are all stack-top-relative
   numbers.
	11 for %st(0) (gnu regno = 8)
	12 for %st(1) (gnu regno = 9)
	13 for %st(2) (gnu regno = 10)
	14 for %st(3) (gnu regno = 11)
	15 for %st(4) (gnu regno = 12)
	16 for %st(5) (gnu regno = 13)
	17 for %st(6) (gnu regno = 14)
	18 for %st(7) (gnu regno = 15)
