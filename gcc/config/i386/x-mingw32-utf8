# For 64-bit Windows host, embed a manifest that sets the active
# code page of the driver and compiler proper processes to utf8.
# This only has an effect on Windows version 1903 (May 2019 Update)
# or later.

# The resource .rc file references the utf8 .manifest file.
# Compile it into an object file using windres.
# The resulting .o file gets added to host_extra_gcc_objs in
# config.host for x86_64-*-mingw* host and gets linked into
# the driver as a .o file, so it's lack of symbols is OK.

# Combine the two object files into one which has both the

# The resulting .o file gets added to host_extra_objs in
# config.host for x86_64-*-mingw* host and gets archived into
# libbackend.a which gets linked into the compiler proper.
# If nothing references it into libbackend.a, it will not
# get linked into the compiler proper eventually.
# Therefore we need to request the symbol at compiler link time.

# Otherwise the object file won't get linked in the compilers
# because nothing is referencing it in libbackend.a
# This is expected because the resource object is not supposed
# to have any symbols, it just has to be linked into the
# executable in order for Windows to use the utf8 code page.
