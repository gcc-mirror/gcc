# On Debian, Ubuntu and other derivative distributions, the 32bit libraries
# are found in /lib32 and /usr/lib32, /lib64 and /usr/lib64 are symlinks to
# /lib and /usr/lib, while other distributions install libraries into /lib64
# and /usr/lib64.  The LSB does not enforce the use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64,
# it doesn't tell anything about the 32bit libraries on those systems.  Set
# MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES according to what is found on the target.

# To support i386, x86-64 and x32 libraries, the directory structrue
# should be:
#
# 	/lib has i386 libraries.
# 	/lib64 has x86-64 libraries.
# 	/libx32 has x32 libraries.
