;; We use the following constraint letters for constants:
;;
;;  I: 0 to 255.
;;  J: 0 to 65535.
;;  L: 0 to 31 (for shift counts).
;;  T: Text segment label.  Needed to know when to select %pmem relocation.
;;  Z: Constant integer zero.
;;
;; We use the following built-in register classes:
;;
;;  r: General purpose register (r0..r31).
;;  m: Memory operand.
;;
;; The following constraints are intended for internal use only:
;;  Rmd0, Rms0, Rms1: Registers for MUL instruction operands.
;;  Rsib: Jump address register suitable for sibling calls.
;;  Rrio: The R30 and R31 I/O registers.
;;  M: -255 to 0 (for converting ADD to SUB with suitable UBYTE OP2).
;;  N: -32768 to 32767 (16-bit signed integer).
;;  O: -128 to 127 (8-bit signed integer).
;;  P: 1
;;  Um: -1 constant.
;;  Uf: A constant with a single consecutive range of 0xff bytes.  Rest
;;      of bytes are zeros.
;;  Uz: A constant with a single consecutive range of 0x00 bytes.  Rest
;;      of bytes are 0xff.
