   the default spec of passing --relax, --mifc, and --mex9 to linker.
   We use NDS32_RELAX_SPEC, NDS32_IFC_SPEC, and NDS32_EX9_SPEC
   so that we can customize them conveniently.  */

/* The option -mno-ctor-dtor can disable constructor/destructor feature
   by applying different crt stuff.  In the convention, crt0.o is the
   startup file without constructor/destructor;
   crt1.o, crti.o, crtbegin.o, crtend.o, and crtn.o are the
   startup files with constructor/destructor.
   Note that crt0.o, crt1.o, crti.o, and crtn.o are provided
   by newlib/mculib/glibc/ublic, while crtbegin.o and crtend.o are
   currently provided by GCC for nds32 target.

   For nds32 target so far:
   If -mno-ctor-dtor, we are going to link
   "crt0.o [user objects]".
   If -mctor-dtor, we are going to link
   "crt1.o crtbegin1.o [user objects] crtend1.o".

   Note that the TARGET_DEFAULT_CTOR_DTOR would effect the
   default behavior.  Check gcc/config.gcc for more information.  */
