/* List of all known ARC base architectures.  These defines are used
   to check if command line given options are valid for a specific
   architecture, and to set default architecture options, if needed.

   Before including this file, define a macro:

   ARC_ARCH (NAME, ARCH, DEV_HW_FACILITIES, DEF_HW_FACILITIES)

   where the arguments are the fields of arc_arch_t:

   NAME			Architecture given name;

   ARCH			Architecture class as in enum base_architecture;

   DEV_HW_FACILITIES	All allowed architecture hardware facilities.
			These facilities are represented as compiler
			options, defined in arc_options.def file.

   DEF_HW_FACILITIES	Default flags for this architecture.  It is a
			subset of DEV_HW_FACILITIES.  */
