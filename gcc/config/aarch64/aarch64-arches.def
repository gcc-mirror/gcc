/* Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

      AARCH64_ARCH(NAME, CORE, ARCH_IDENT, ARCH_REV, FLAGS)

   The NAME is the name of the architecture, represented as a string
   constant.  The CORE is the identifier for a core representative of
   this architecture.  ARCH_IDENT is the architecture identifier.  It must be
   unique and be syntactically valid to appear as part of an enum identifier.
   ARCH_REV is an integer specifying the architecture major revision.
   FLAGS are the flags implied by the architecture.
   Due to the assumptions about the positions of these fields in config.gcc,
   NAME should be kept as the first argument.  */
