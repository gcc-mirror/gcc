/* This is a list of ISA extentsions in AArch64.

   Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

   EXT_NAME is the name of the extension, represented as a string constant.
   FLAGS_ON are the bitwise-or of the features that the extension adds.
   FLAGS_OFF are the bitwise-or of the features that the extension removes.  */
