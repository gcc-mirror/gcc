/* This pass scans the RTL just before the final branch
   re-organisation pass.  The aim is to identify all places where
   there is conditional control flow and to insert code that tracks
   any speculative execution of a conditional branch.

   To do this we reserve a call-clobbered register (so that it can be
   initialized very early in the function prologue) that can then be
   updated each time there is a conditional branch.  At each such
   branch we then generate a code sequence that uses conditional
   select operations that are not subject to speculation themselves
   (we ignore for the moment situations where that might not always be
   strictly true).  For example, a branch sequence such as:

	B.EQ	<dst>
	...
   <dst>:

   is transformed to:

	B.EQ	<dst>
	CSEL	tracker, tracker, XZr, ne
	...
   <dst>:
	CSEL	tracker, tracker, XZr, eq

   Since we start with the tracker initialized to all bits one, if at any
   time the predicted control flow diverges from the architectural program
   behavior, then the tracker will become zero (but not otherwise).

   The tracker value can be used at any time at which a value needs
   guarding against incorrect speculation.  This can be done in
   several ways, but they all amount to the same thing.  For an
   untrusted address, or an untrusted offset to a trusted address, we
   can simply mask the address with the tracker with the untrusted
   value.  If the CPU is not speculating, or speculating correctly,
   then the value will remain unchanged, otherwise it will be clamped
   to zero.  For more complex scenarios we can compare the tracker
   against zero and use the flags to form a new selection with an
   alternate safe value.

   On implementations where the data processing instructions may
   themselves produce speculative values, the architecture requires
   that a CSDB instruction will resolve such data speculation, so each
   time we use the tracker for protecting a vulnerable value we also
   emit a CSDB: we do not need to do that each time the tracker itself
   is updated.

   At function boundaries, we need to communicate the speculation
   tracking state with the caller or the callee.  This is tricky
   because there is no register available for such a purpose without
   creating a new ABI.  We deal with this by relying on the principle
   that in all real programs the stack pointer, SP will never be NULL
   at a function boundary; we can thus encode the speculation state in
   SP by clearing SP if the speculation tracker itself is NULL.  After
   the call we recover the tracking state back from SP into the
   tracker register.  The results is that a function call sequence is
   transformed to

	MOV	tmp, SP
	AND	tmp, tmp, tracker
	MOV	SP, tmp
	BL	<callee>
	CMP	SP, #0
	CSETM	tracker, ne

   The additional MOV instructions in the pre-call sequence are needed
   because SP cannot be used directly with the AND instruction.

   The code inside a function body uses the post-call sequence in the
   prologue to establish the tracker and the pre-call sequence in the
   epilogue to re-encode the state for the return.

   The code sequences have the nice property that if called from, or
   calling a function that does not track speculation then the stack pointer
   will always be non-NULL and hence the tracker will be initialized to all
   bits one as we need: we lose the ability to fully track speculation in that
   case, but we are still architecturally safe.

   Tracking speculation in this way is quite expensive, both in code
   size and execution time.  We employ a number of tricks to try to
   limit this:

   1) Simple leaf functions with no conditional branches (or use of
   the tracker) do not need to establish a new tracker: they simply
   carry the tracking state through SP for the duration of the call.
   The same is also true for leaf functions that end in a tail-call.

   2) Back-to-back function calls in a single basic block also do not
   need to re-establish the tracker between the calls.  Again, we can
   carry the tracking state in SP for this period of time unless the
   tracker value is needed at that point in time.

   We run the pass just before the final branch reorganization pass so
   that we can handle most of the conditional branch cases using the
   standard edge insertion code.  The reorg pass will hopefully clean
   things up for afterwards so that the results aren't too
   horrible.  */
