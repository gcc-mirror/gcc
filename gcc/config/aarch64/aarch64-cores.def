/* This is a list of cores that implement AArch64.

   Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

      AARCH64_CORE(CORE_NAME, CORE_IDENT, SCHEDULER_IDENT, ARCH_IDENT, FLAGS, COSTS, IMP, PART)

   The CORE_NAME is the name of the core, represented as a string constant.
   The CORE_IDENT is the name of the core, represented as an identifier.
   The SCHEDULER_IDENT is the name of the core for which scheduling decisions
   will be made, represented as an identifier.
   ARCH_IDENT is the architecture implemented by the chip as specified in
   aarch64-arches.def.
   FLAGS are the bitwise-or of the traits that apply to that core.
   This need not include flags implied by the architecture.
   COSTS is the name of the rtx_costs routine to use.
   IMP is the implementer ID of the CPU vendor.  On a GNU/Linux system it can
   be found in /proc/cpuinfo.
   PART is the part number of the CPU.  On a GNU/Linux system it can be found
   in /proc/cpuinfo.  For big.LITTLE systems this should have the form at of
   "<big core part number>.<LITTLE core part number>".  */
