/* This is a list of cores that implement AArch64.

   Before using #include to read this file, define a macro:

      AARCH64_CORE(CORE_NAME, CORE_IDENT, SCHEDULER_IDENT, ARCH, FLAGS, COSTS)

   The CORE_NAME is the name of the core, represented as a string constant.
   The CORE_IDENT is the name of the core, represented as an identifier.
   The SCHEDULER_IDENT is the name of the core for which scheduling decisions
   will be made, represented as an identifier.
   ARCH is the architecture revision implemented by the chip.
   FLAGS are the bitwise-or of the traits that apply to that core.
   This need not include flags implied by the architecture.
   COSTS is the name of the rtx_costs routine to use.  */
