;; We use the following constraint letters for constants
;;
;;  I: -32768 to 32767
;;  J: 0 to 65535
;;  K: $nnnn0000 for some nnnn
;;  P: Under R2, $nnnnffff or $ffffnnnn for some nnnn
;;  L: 0 to 31 (for shift counts)
;;  M: 0
;;  N: 0 to 255 (for custom instruction numbers)
;;  O: 0 to 31 (for control register numbers)
;;  U: -32768 to 32767 under R1, -2048 to 2047 under R2
;;
;; We use the following constraint letters for memory constraints
;;
;;  v: memory operands for R2 load/store exclusive instructions
;;  w: memory operands for load/store IO and cache instructions
;;
;; We use the following built-in register classes:
;;
;;  r: general purpose register (r0..r31)
;;  m: memory operand
;;
;; Plus, we define the following constraint strings:
;;
;;  S: symbol that is in the "small data" area
