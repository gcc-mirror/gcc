/* We order the 3 128-bit floating point types so that IFmode (IBM 128-bit
   floating point) is the 128-bit floating point type with the highest
   precision (128 bits).  This so that machine independent parts of the
   compiler do not try to widen IFmode to TFmode on ISA 3.0 (power9) that has
   hardware support for IEEE 128-bit.  We set TFmode (long double mode) in
   between, and KFmode (explicit __float128) below it.

   We won't encounter conversion from IEEE 128-bit to IBM 128-bit because we
   don't have insns to support the IBM 128-bit aritmetic operations.  */
