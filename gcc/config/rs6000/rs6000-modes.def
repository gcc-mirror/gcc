/* We order the 3 128-bit floating point types so that IFmode (IBM 128-bit
   floating point) is the 128-bit floating point type with the highest
   precision (128 bits).  This so that machine independent parts of the
   compiler do not try to widen IFmode to TFmode on ISA 3.0 (power9) that has
   hardware support for IEEE 128-bit.  We set TFmode (long double mode) in
   between, and KFmode (explicit __float128) below it.

   Previously, IFmode and KFmode were defined to be fractional modes and TFmode
   was the standard mode.  Since IFmode does not define the normal arithmetic
   insns (other than neg/abs), on a ISA 3.0 system, the machine independent
   parts of the compiler would see that TFmode has the necessary hardware
   support, and widen the operation from IFmode to TFmode.  However, IEEE
   128-bit is not strictly a super-set of IBM extended double and the
   conversion to/from IEEE 128-bit was a function call.

   We now make IFmode the highest fractional mode, which means its values are
   not considered for widening.  Since we don't define insns for IFmode, the
   IEEE 128-bit modes would not widen to IFmode.  */
