# This is probably the correct define, to override the Makefile

# Using it will cause fixincludes to try and fix some of the

# the other hand, not using it will only cause the gcc version
# of limits.h to lack the header and trailer parts that are
# tacked on to it when there is a limits.h in the system header
# dir.

# For now it is probably better to change the rule for
# LIMITS_H_TEST to explicitly look for the BeOS limits.h.
