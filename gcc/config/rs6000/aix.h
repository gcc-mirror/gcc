   e.g. if a.out depends on lib1.so, the init function for a.out is called before
   the init function for lib1.so.

   To ensure global C++ constructors in linked libraries are run before global
   C++ constructors from the current module, there is additional symbol scanning
   logic in collect2.

   The global initialiser/finaliser functions are named __GLOBAL_AIXI_{libname}
   and __GLOBAL_AIXD_{libname} and are exported from each shared library.

   collect2 will detect these symbols when they exist in shared libraries that
   the current program is being linked against.  All such initiliser functions
   will be called prior to the constructors of the current program, and
   finaliser functions called after destructors.

   Reference counting generated by collect2 will ensure that constructors are
   only invoked once in the case of multiple dependencies on a library.

   -binitfini is still used in parallel to this solution.
   This handles the case where a library is loaded through dlopen(), and also
   handles the option -blazy.
