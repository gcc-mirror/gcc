/* Define microarchitectures for the -mtune option, used both in
   m68k.c and to generate m68k-tables.opt.  Before including this
   file, define a macro:

   M68K_MICROARCH (NAME, DEVICE, MICROARCH, ISA, FLAGS)

   where NAME is the name for use with -mtune=, DEVICE is the value in
   the target_device enumeration of a representative device, FLAGS is
   the set of FL_* flags that apply to this ISA and the other
   arguments are as for M68K_DEVICE in m68k-devices.def.  */
