;; We compute exact length on each instruction for most of the time.
;; In some case, most notably bit operations that may involve memory
;; operands, the lengths in this file are "worst case".

;; On the H8/300H and H8S, adds/subs operate on the 32bit "er"
;; registers.  Right now GCC doesn't expose the "e" half to the
;; compiler, so using add/subs for addhi and subhi is safe.  Long
;; term, we want to expose the "e" half to the compiler (gives us 8
;; more 16bit registers).  At that point addhi and subhi can't use
;; adds/subs.

;; There's currently no way to have an insv/extzv expander for the H8/300H
;; because word_mode is different for the H8/300 and H8/300H.

;; Shifts/rotates by small constants should be handled by special
;; patterns so we get the length and cc status correct.

;; Bitfield operations no longer accept memory operands.  We need
;; to add variants which operate on memory back to the MD.

;; ??? Implement remaining bit ops available on the h8300
