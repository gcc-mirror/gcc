;; Some patterns need to use er6 as a scratch register.  This is
;; difficult to arrange since er6 is the frame pointer and usually can't
;; be spilled.

;; Such patterns should define two alternatives, one which allows only
;; er6 and one which allows any general register.  The former
;; alternative should have a 'd' constraint while the latter should be
;; disparaged and use 'D'.

;; Normally, 'd' maps to DESTINATION_REGS and 'D' maps to GENERAL_REGS.
;; However, there are cases where they should be NO_REGS:

;;   - 'd' should be NO_REGS when reloading a function that uses the
;;     frame pointer.  In this case, DESTINATION_REGS won't contain any
;;     spillable registers, so the first alternative can't be used.

;;   - -fno-omit-frame-pointer means that the frame pointer will
;;     always be in use.  It's therefore better to map 'd' to NO_REGS
;;     before reload so that register allocator will pick the second
;;     alternative.

;;   - we would like 'D' to be NO_REGS when the frame pointer isn't
;;     live, but we the frame pointer may turn out to be needed after
;;     we start reload, and then we may have already decided we don't
;;     have a choice, so we can't do that.  Forcing the register
;;     allocator to use er6 if possible might produce better code for
;;     small functions: it's more efficient to save and restore er6 in
;;     the prologue & epilogue than to do it in a define_split.
;;     Hopefully disparaging 'D' will have a similar effect, without
;;     forcing a reload failure if the frame pointer is found to be
;;     needed too late.
