/* There are many algorithms for performing strength reduction on
   loops.  This is not one of them.  IVOPTS handles strength reduction
   of induction variables just fine.  This pass is intended to pick
   up the crumbs it leaves behind, by considering opportunities for
   strength reduction along dominator paths.

   Strength reduction addresses explicit multiplies, and certain
   multiplies implicit in addressing expressions.  It would also be
   possible to apply strength reduction to divisions and modulos,
   but such opportunities are relatively uncommon.

   Strength reduction is also currently restricted to integer operations.
   If desired, it could be extended to floating-point operations under
   control of something like -funsafe-math-optimizations.  */

/* Information about a strength reduction candidate.  Each statement
   in the candidate table represents an expression of one of the
   following forms (the special case of CAND_REF will be described
   later):

   (CAND_MULT)  S1:  X = (B + i) * S
   (CAND_ADD)   S1:  X = B + (i * S)

   Here X and B are SSA names, i is an integer constant, and S is
   either an SSA name or a constant.  We call B the "base," i the
   "index", and S the "stride."

   Any statement S0 that dominates S1 and is of the form:

   (CAND_MULT)  S0:  Y = (B + i') * S
   (CAND_ADD)   S0:  Y = B + (i' * S)

   is called a "basis" for S1.  In both cases, S1 may be replaced by
   
                S1':  X = Y + (i - i') * S,

   where (i - i') * S is folded to the extent possible.

   All gimple statements are visited in dominator order, and each
   statement that may contribute to one of the forms of S1 above is
   given at least one entry in the candidate table.  Such statements
   include addition, pointer addition, subtraction, multiplication,
   negation, copies, and nontrivial type casts.  If a statement may
   represent more than one expression of the forms of S1 above, 
   multiple "interpretations" are stored in the table and chained
   together.  Examples:

   * An add of two SSA names may treat either operand as the base.
   * A multiply of two SSA names, likewise.
   * A copy or cast may be thought of as either a CAND_MULT with
     i = 0 and S = 1, or as a CAND_ADD with i = 0 or S = 0.

   Candidate records are allocated from an obstack.  They are addressed
   both from a hash table keyed on S1, and from a vector of candidate
   pointers arranged in predominator order.

   Opportunity note
   ----------------
   Currently we don't recognize:

     S0: Y = (S * i') - B
     S1: X = (S * i) - B

   as a strength reduction opportunity, even though this S1 would
   also be replaceable by the S1' above.  This can be added if it
   comes up in practice.

   Strength reduction in addressing
   --------------------------------
   There is another kind of candidate known as CAND_REF.  A CAND_REF
   describes a statement containing a memory reference having 
   complex addressing that might benefit from strength reduction.
   Specifically, we are interested in references for which 
   get_inner_reference returns a base address, offset, and bitpos as
   follows:

     base:    MEM_REF (T1, C1)
     offset:  MULT_EXPR (PLUS_EXPR (T2, C2), C3)
     bitpos:  C4 * BITS_PER_UNIT

   Here T1 and T2 are arbitrary trees, and C1, C2, C3, C4 are 
   arbitrary integer constants.  Note that C2 may be zero, in which
   case the offset will be MULT_EXPR (T2, C3).

   When this pattern is recognized, the original memory reference
   can be replaced with:

     MEM_REF (POINTER_PLUS_EXPR (T1, MULT_EXPR (T2, C3)),
              C1 + (C2 * C3) + C4)

   which distributes the multiply to allow constant folding.  When
   two or more addressing expressions can be represented by MEM_REFs
   of this form, differing only in the constants C1, C2, and C4,
   making this substitution produces more efficient addressing during
   the RTL phases.  When there are not at least two expressions with
   the same values of T1, T2, and C3, there is nothing to be gained
   by the replacement.

   Strength reduction of CAND_REFs uses the same infrastructure as
   that used by CAND_MULTs and CAND_ADDs.  We record T1 in the base (B)
   field, MULT_EXPR (T2, C3) in the stride (S) field, and 
   C1 + (C2 * C3) + C4 in the index (i) field.  A basis for a CAND_REF
   is thus another CAND_REF with the same B and S values.  When at 
   least two CAND_REFs are chained together using the basis relation,
   each of them is replaced as above, resulting in improved code
   generation for addressing.

   Conditional candidates
   ======================

   Conditional candidates are best illustrated with an example.
   Consider the code sequence:

   (1)  x_0 = ...;
   (2)  a_0 = x_0 * 5;          MULT (B: x_0; i: 0; S: 5)
        if (...)
   (3)    x_1 = x_0 + 1;        ADD  (B: x_0, i: 1; S: 1)
   (4)  x_2 = PHI <x_0, x_1>;   PHI  (B: x_0, i: 0, S: 1)
   (5)  x_3 = x_2 + 1;          ADD  (B: x_2, i: 1, S: 1)
   (6)  a_1 = x_3 * 5;          MULT (B: x_2, i: 1; S: 5)

   Here strength reduction is complicated by the uncertain value of x_2.
   A legitimate transformation is:

   (1)  x_0 = ...;
   (2)  a_0 = x_0 * 5;
        if (...)
	  {
   (3)      [x_1 = x_0 + 1;]
   (3a)     t_1 = a_0 + 5;
          }
   (4)  [x_2 = PHI <x_0, x_1>;]
   (4a) t_2 = PHI <a_0, t_1>;
   (5)  [x_3 = x_2 + 1;]
   (6r) a_1 = t_2 + 5;

   where the bracketed instructions may go dead.

   To recognize this opportunity, we have to observe that statement (6)
   has a "hidden basis" (2).  The hidden basis is unlike a normal basis
   in that the statement and the hidden basis have different base SSA
   names (x_2 and x_0, respectively).  The relationship is established
   when a statement's base name (x_2) is defined by a phi statement (4),
   each argument of which (x_0, x_1) has an identical "derived base name."
   If the argument is defined by a candidate (as x_1 is by (3)) that is a
   CAND_ADD having a stride of 1, the derived base name of the argument is
   the base name of the candidate (x_0).  Otherwise, the argument itself
   is its derived base name (as is the case with argument x_0).

   The hidden basis for statement (6) is the nearest dominating candidate
   whose base name is the derived base name (x_0) of the feeding phi (4), 
   and whose stride is identical to that of the statement.  We can then
   create the new "phi basis" (4a) and feeding adds along incoming arcs (3a),
   allowing the final replacement of (6) by the strength-reduced (6r).

   To facilitate this, a new kind of candidate (CAND_PHI) is introduced.
   A CAND_PHI is not a candidate for replacement, but is maintained in the
   candidate table to ease discovery of hidden bases.  Any phi statement
   whose arguments share a common derived base name is entered into the
   table with the derived base name, an (arbitrary) index of zero, and a
   stride of 1.  A statement with a hidden basis can then be detected by
   simply looking up its feeding phi definition in the candidate table,
   extracting the derived base name, and searching for a basis in the
   usual manner after substituting the derived base name.

   Note that the transformation is only valid when the original phi and 
   the statements that define the phi's arguments are all at the same
   position in the loop hierarchy.  */
