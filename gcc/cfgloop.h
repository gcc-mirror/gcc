       2) Clear buffered result of niter/scev analyzer.

	  on niter/scev analyzer, the point is that niter/scev analysis
	  is done under circumstance of LOOP_C_FINITE constraint.
       5) Version the loop with niter->assumptions computed in step 1).
       6) Vectorize the versioned loop in which niter->assumptions is
	  checked to be true.
       7) Update constraints in versioned loops so that niter analyzer
	  in following passes can use it.

     Note consumers are usually the loop optimizers and it is consumers'
     responsibility to set/clear constraints correctly.  Failing to do
