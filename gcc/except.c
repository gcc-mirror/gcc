/* An exception is an event that can be signaled from within a
   function. This event can then be "caught" or "trapped" by the
   callers of this function. This potentially allows program flow to
   be transferred to any arbitrary code associated with a function call
   several levels up the stack.

   The intended use for this mechanism is for signaling "exceptional
   events" in an out-of-band fashion, hence its name. The C++ language
   (and many other OO-styled or functional languages) practically
   requires such a mechanism, as otherwise it becomes very difficult
   or even impossible to signal failure conditions in complex
   situations.  The traditional C++ example is when an error occurs in
   the process of constructing an object; without such a mechanism, it
   is impossible to signal that the error occurs without adding global
   state variables and error checks around every object construction.

   The act of causing this event to occur is referred to as "throwing
   an exception". (Alternate terms include "raising an exception" or
   "signaling an exception".) The term "throw" is used because control
   is returned to the callers of the function that is signaling the
   exception, and thus there is the concept of "throwing" the
   exception up the call stack.

   There are two major codegen options for exception handling.  The
   flag -fsjlj-exceptions can be used to select the setjmp/longjmp
   approach, which is the default.  -fno-sjlj-exceptions can be used to
   get the PC range table approach.  While this is a compile time
   flag, an entire application must be compiled with the same codegen
   option.  The first is a PC range table approach, the second is a
   setjmp/longjmp based scheme.  We will first discuss the PC range
   table approach, after that, we will discuss the setjmp/longjmp
   based approach.

   It is appropriate to speak of the "context of a throw". This
   context refers to the address where the exception is thrown from,
   and is used to determine which exception region will handle the
   exception.

   Regions of code within a function can be marked such that if it
   contains the context of a throw, control will be passed to a
   designated "exception handler". These areas are known as "exception
   regions".  Exception regions cannot overlap, but they can be nested
   to any arbitrary depth. Also, exception regions cannot cross
   function boundaries.

   Exception handlers can either be specified by the user (which we
   will call a "user-defined handler") or generated by the compiler
   (which we will designate as a "cleanup"). Cleanups are used to
   perform tasks such as destruction of objects allocated on the
   stack.

   In the current implementation, cleanups are handled by allocating an
   exception region for the area that the cleanup is designated for,
   and the handler for the region performs the cleanup and then
   rethrows the exception to the outer exception region. From the
   standpoint of the current implementation, there is little
   distinction made between a cleanup and a user-defined handler, and
   the phrase "exception handler" can be used to refer to either one
   equally well. (The section "Future Directions" below discusses how
   this will change).

   Each object file that is compiled with exception handling contains
   a static array of exception handlers named __EXCEPTION_TABLE__.
   Each entry contains the starting and ending addresses of the
   exception region, and the address of the handler designated for
   that region.

   If the target does not use the DWARF 2 frame unwind information, at
   program startup each object file invokes a function named
   __register_exceptions with the address of its local
   __EXCEPTION_TABLE__. __register_exceptions is defined in libgcc2.c, and
   is responsible for recording all of the exception regions into one list
   (which is kept in a static variable named exception_table_list).

   On targets that support crtstuff.c, the unwind information
   is stored in a section named .eh_frame and the information for the
   entire shared object or program is registered with a call to
   __register_frame_info.  On other targets, the information for each
   translation unit is registered from the file generated by collect2.
   __register_frame_info is defined in frame.c, and is responsible for
   recording all of the unwind regions into one list (which is kept in a
   static variable named unwind_table_list).

   The function __throw is actually responsible for doing the
   throw. On machines that have unwind info support, __throw is generated
   by code in libgcc2.c, otherwise __throw is generated on a
   per-object-file basis for each source file compiled with
   -fexceptions by the C++ frontend.  Before __throw is invoked,
   the current context of the throw needs to be placed in the global
   variable __eh_pc.

   __throw attempts to find the appropriate exception handler for the 
   PC value stored in __eh_pc by calling __find_first_exception_table_match
   (which is defined in libgcc2.c). If __find_first_exception_table_match
   finds a relevant handler, __throw transfers control directly to it.

   If a handler for the context being thrown from can't be found, __throw
   walks (see Walking the stack below) the stack up the dynamic call chain to
   continue searching for an appropriate exception handler based upon the
   caller of the function it last sought a exception handler for.  It stops
   then either an exception handler is found, or when the top of the
   call chain is reached.

   If no handler is found, an external library function named
   __terminate is called.  If a handler is found, then we restart
   our search for a handler at the end of the call chain, and repeat
   the search process, but instead of just walking up the call chain,
   we unwind the call chain as we walk up it.

   Internal implementation details:

   To associate a user-defined handler with a block of statements, the
   function expand_start_try_stmts is used to mark the start of the
   block of statements with which the handler is to be associated
   (which is known as a "try block"). All statements that appear
   afterwards will be associated with the try block.

   A call to expand_start_all_catch marks the end of the try block,
   and also marks the start of the "catch block" (the user-defined
   handler) associated with the try block.

   This user-defined handler will be invoked for *every* exception
   thrown with the context of the try block. It is up to the handler
   to decide whether or not it wishes to handle any given exception,
   as there is currently no mechanism in this implementation for doing
   this. (There are plans for conditionally processing an exception
   based on its "type", which will provide a language-independent
   mechanism).

   If the handler chooses not to process the exception (perhaps by
   looking at an "exception type" or some other additional data
   supplied with the exception), it can fall through to the end of the
   handler. expand_end_all_catch and expand_leftover_cleanups
   add additional code to the end of each handler to take care of
   rethrowing to the outer exception handler.

   The handler also has the option to continue with "normal flow of
   code", or in other words to resume executing at the statement
   immediately after the end of the exception region. The variable
   caught_return_label_stack contains a stack of labels, and jumping
   to the topmost entry's label via expand_goto will resume normal
   flow to the statement immediately after the end of the exception
   region. If the handler falls through to the end, the exception will
   be rethrown to the outer exception region.

   The instructions for the catch block are kept as a separate
   sequence, and will be emitted at the end of the function along with
   the handlers specified via expand_eh_region_end. The end of the
   catch block is marked with expand_end_all_catch.

   Any data associated with the exception must currently be handled by
   some external mechanism maintained in the frontend.  For example,
   the C++ exception mechanism passes an arbitrary value along with
   the exception, and this is handled in the C++ frontend by using a
   global variable to hold the value. (This will be changing in the
   future.)

   The mechanism in C++ for handling data associated with the
   exception is clearly not thread-safe. For a thread-based
   environment, another mechanism must be used (possibly using a
   per-thread allocation mechanism if the size of the area that needs
   to be allocated isn't known at compile time.)

   Internally-generated exception regions (cleanups) are marked by
   calling expand_eh_region_start to mark the start of the region,
   and expand_eh_region_end (handler) is used to both designate the
   end of the region and to associate a specified handler/cleanup with
   the region. The rtl code in HANDLER will be invoked whenever an
   exception occurs in the region between the calls to
   expand_eh_region_start and expand_eh_region_end. After HANDLER is
   executed, additional code is emitted to handle rethrowing the
   exception to the outer exception handler. The code for HANDLER will
   be emitted at the end of the function.

   TARGET_EXPRs can also be used to designate exception regions. A
   TARGET_EXPR gives an unwind-protect style interface commonly used
   in functional languages such as LISP. The associated expression is
   evaluated, and whether or not it (or any of the functions that it
   calls) throws an exception, the protect expression is always
   invoked. This implementation takes care of the details of
   associating an exception table entry with the expression and
   generating the necessary code (it actually emits the protect
   expression twice, once for normal flow and once for the exception
   case). As for the other handlers, the code for the exception case
   will be emitted at the end of the function.

   Cleanups can also be specified by using add_partial_entry (handler)
   and end_protect_partials. add_partial_entry creates the start of
   a new exception region; HANDLER will be invoked if an exception is
   thrown with the context of the region between the calls to
   add_partial_entry and end_protect_partials. end_protect_partials is
   used to mark the end of these regions. add_partial_entry can be
   called as many times as needed before calling end_protect_partials.
   However, end_protect_partials should only be invoked once for each
   group of calls to add_partial_entry as the entries are queued
   and all of the outstanding entries are processed simultaneously
   when end_protect_partials is invoked. Similarly to the other
   handlers, the code for HANDLER will be emitted at the end of the
   function.

   The generated RTL for an exception region includes
   NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_BEG and NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_END notes that mark
   the start and end of the exception region. A unique label is also
   generated at the start of the exception region, which is available
   by looking at the ehstack variable. The topmost entry corresponds
   to the current region.

   In the current implementation, an exception can only be thrown from
   a function call (since the mechanism used to actually throw an
   exception involves calling __throw).  If an exception region is
   created but no function calls occur within that region, the region
   can be safely optimized away (along with its exception handlers)
   since no exceptions can ever be caught in that region.  This
   optimization is performed unless -fasynchronous-exceptions is
   given.  If the user wishes to throw from a signal handler, or other
   asynchronous place, -fasynchronous-exceptions should be used when
   compiling for maximally correct code, at the cost of additional
   exception regions.  Using -fasynchronous-exceptions only produces
   code that is reasonably safe in such situations, but a correct
   program cannot rely upon this working.  It can be used in failsafe
   code, where trying to continue on, and proceeding with potentially
   incorrect results is better than halting the program.


   Walking the stack:

   The stack is walked by starting with a pointer to the current
   frame, and finding the pointer to the callers frame.  The unwind info
   tells __throw how to find it.

   Unwinding the stack:

   When we use the term unwinding the stack, we mean undoing the
   effects of the function prologue in a controlled fashion so that we
   still have the flow of control.  Otherwise, we could just return
   (jump to the normal end of function epilogue).

   This is done in __throw in libgcc2.c when we know that a handler exists
   in a frame higher up the call stack than its immediate caller.

   To unwind, we find the unwind data associated with the frame, if any.
   If we don't find any, we call the library routine __terminate.  If we do
   find it, we use the information to copy the saved register values from
   that frame into the register save area in the frame for __throw, return
   into a stub which updates the stack pointer, and jump to the handler.
   The normal function epilogue for __throw handles restoring the saved
   values into registers.

   When unwinding, we use this method if we know it will
   work (if DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO is defined).  Otherwise, we know that
   an inline unwinder will have been emitted for any function that
   __unwind_function cannot unwind.  The inline unwinder appears as a
   normal exception handler for the entire function, for any function
   that we know cannot be unwound by __unwind_function.  We inform the
   compiler of whether a function can be unwound with
   __unwind_function by having DOESNT_NEED_UNWINDER evaluate to true
   when the unwinder isn't needed.  __unwind_function is used as an
   action of last resort.  If no other method can be used for
   unwinding, __unwind_function is used.  If it cannot unwind, it
   should call __terminate.

   By default, if the target-specific backend doesn't supply a definition
   for __unwind_function and doesn't support DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO, inlined
   unwinders will be used instead. The main tradeoff here is in text space
   utilization.  Obviously, if inline unwinders have to be generated
   repeatedly, this uses much more space than if a single routine is used.

   However, it is simply not possible on some platforms to write a
   generalized routine for doing stack unwinding without having some
   form of additional data associated with each function.  The current
   implementation can encode this data in the form of additional
   machine instructions or as static data in tabular form.  The later
   is called the unwind data.

   The backend macro DOESNT_NEED_UNWINDER is used to conditionalize whether
   or not per-function unwinders are needed. If DOESNT_NEED_UNWINDER is
   defined and has a non-zero value, a per-function unwinder is not emitted
   for the current function.  If the static unwind data is supported, then
   a per-function unwinder is not emitted.

   On some platforms it is possible that neither __unwind_function
   nor inlined unwinders are available. For these platforms it is not
   possible to throw through a function call, and abort will be
   invoked instead of performing the throw. 

   The reason the unwind data may be needed is that on some platforms
   the order and types of data stored on the stack can vary depending
   on the type of function, its arguments and returned values, and the
   compilation options used (optimization versus non-optimization,
   -fomit-frame-pointer, processor variations, etc).

   Unfortunately, this also means that throwing through functions that
   aren't compiled with exception handling support will still not be
   possible on some platforms. This problem is currently being
   investigated, but no solutions have been found that do not imply
   some unacceptable performance penalties.

   Future directions:

   Currently __throw makes no differentiation between cleanups and
   user-defined exception regions. While this makes the implementation
   simple, it also implies that it is impossible to determine if a
   user-defined exception handler exists for a given exception without
   completely unwinding the stack in the process. This is undesirable
   from the standpoint of debugging, as ideally it would be possible
   to trap unhandled exceptions in the debugger before the process of
   unwinding has even started.

   This problem can be solved by marking user-defined handlers in a
   special way (probably by adding additional bits to exception_table_list).
   A two-pass scheme could then be used by __throw to iterate
   through the table. The first pass would search for a relevant
   user-defined handler for the current context of the throw, and if
   one is found, the second pass would then invoke all needed cleanups
   before jumping to the user-defined handler.

   Many languages (including C++ and Ada) make execution of a
   user-defined handler conditional on the "type" of the exception
   thrown. (The type of the exception is actually the type of the data
   that is thrown with the exception.) It will thus be necessary for
   __throw to be able to determine if a given user-defined
   exception handler will actually be executed, given the type of
   exception.

   One scheme is to add additional information to exception_table_list
   as to the types of exceptions accepted by each handler. __throw
   can do the type comparisons and then determine if the handler is
   actually going to be executed.

   There is currently no significant level of debugging support
   available, other than to place a breakpoint on __throw. While
   this is sufficient in most cases, it would be helpful to be able to
   know where a given exception was going to be thrown to before it is
   actually thrown, and to be able to choose between stopping before
   every exception region (including cleanups), or just user-defined
   exception regions. This should be possible to do in the two-pass
   scheme by adding additional labels to __throw for appropriate
   breakpoints, and additional debugger commands could be added to
   query various state variables to determine what actions are to be
   performed next.

   Another major problem that is being worked on is the issue with stack
   unwinding on various platforms. Currently the only platforms that have
   support for the generation of a generic unwinder are the SPARC and MIPS.
   All other ports require per-function unwinders, which produce large
   amounts of code bloat.

   For setjmp/longjmp based exception handling, some of the details
   are as above, but there are some additional details.  This section
   discusses the details.

   We don't use NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_{BEG,END} pairs.  We don't
   optimize EH regions yet.  We don't have to worry about machine
   specific issues with unwinding the stack, as we rely upon longjmp
   for all the machine specific details.  There is no variable context
   of a throw, just the one implied by the dynamic handler stack
   pointed to by the dynamic handler chain.  There is no exception
   table, and no calls to __register_exceptions.  __sjthrow is used
   instead of __throw, and it works by using the dynamic handler
   chain, and longjmp.  -fasynchronous-exceptions has no effect, as
   the elimination of trivial exception regions is not yet performed.

   A frontend can set protect_cleanup_actions_with_terminate when all
   the cleanup actions should be protected with an EH region that
   calls terminate when an unhandled exception is throw.  C++ does
   this, Ada does not.  */
