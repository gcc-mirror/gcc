   DEFGSCODE(GIMPLE_symbol, printable name, structure).

   Where symbol is the enumeration name without the ``GIMPLE_''.
   The argument STRUCTURE is used to compute offsets into each of the
   tuple structures that contain operands.  Since vector operands
   are at different offsets depending on the particular structure
   used, these offsets are computed at compile time for efficient
   lookup at runtime.  See gimple_ops().
