/* This pass inserts prefetch instructions to optimize cache usage during
   accesses to arrays in loops.  It processes loops sequentially and:

   1) Gathers all memory references in the single loop.
   2) For each of the references it decides when it is profitable to prefetch
      it.  To do it, we evaluate the reuse among the accesses, and determines
      two values: PREFETCH_BEFORE (meaning that it only makes sense to do
      prefetching in the first PREFETCH_BEFORE iterations of the loop) and
      PREFETCH_MOD (meaning that it only makes sense to prefetch in the
      iterations of the loop that are zero modulo PREFETCH_MOD).  For example
      (assuming cache line size is 64 bytes, char has size 1 byte and there
      is no hardware sequential prefetch):

      char *a;
      for (i = 0; i < max; i++)
	{
	  a[255] = ...;		(0)
	  a[i] = ...;		(1)
	  a[i + 64] = ...;	(2)
	  a[16*i] = ...;	(3)
	  a[187*i] = ...;	(4)
	  a[187*i + 50] = ...;	(5)
	}

       (0) obviously has PREFETCH_BEFORE 1
       (1) has PREFETCH_BEFORE 64, since (2) accesses the same memory
           location 64 iterations before it, and PREFETCH_MOD 64 (since
	   it hits the same cache line otherwise).
       (2) has PREFETCH_MOD 64
       (3) has PREFETCH_MOD 4
       (4) has PREFETCH_MOD 1.  We do not set PREFETCH_BEFORE here, since
           the cache line accessed by (5) is the same with probability only
	   7/32.
       (5) has PREFETCH_MOD 1 as well.

      Additionally, we use data dependence analysis to determine for each
      reference the distance till the first reuse; this information is used
      to determine the temporality of the issued prefetch instruction.

   3) We determine how much ahead we need to prefetch.  The number of
      iterations needed is time to fetch / time spent in one iteration of
      the loop.  The problem is that we do not know either of these values,
      so we just make a heuristic guess based on a magic (possibly)
      target-specific constant and size of the loop.

   4) Determine which of the references we prefetch.  We take into account
      that there is a maximum number of simultaneous prefetches (provided
      by machine description).  We prefetch as many prefetches as possible
      while still within this bound (starting with those with lowest
      prefetch_mod, since they are responsible for most of the cache
      misses).

   5) We unroll and peel loops so that we are able to satisfy PREFETCH_MOD
      and PREFETCH_BEFORE requirements (within some bounds), and to avoid
      prefetching nonaccessed memory.
      TODO -- actually implement peeling.

   6) We actually emit the prefetch instructions.  ??? Perhaps emit the
      prefetch instructions with guards in cases where 5) was not sufficient
      to satisfy the constraints?

   A cost model is implemented to determine whether or not prefetching is
   profitable for a given loop.  The cost model has three heuristics:

   1. Function trip_count_to_ahead_ratio_too_small_p implements a
      heuristic that determines whether or not the loop has too few
      iterations (compared to ahead).  Prefetching is not likely to be
      beneficial if the trip count to ahead ratio is below a certain
      minimum.

   2. Function mem_ref_count_reasonable_p implements a heuristic that
      determines whether the given loop has enough CPU ops that can be
      overlapped with cache missing memory ops.  If not, the loop
      won't benefit from prefetching.  In the implementation,
      prefetching is not considered beneficial if the ratio between
      the instruction count and the mem ref count is below a certain
      minimum.

   3. Function insn_to_prefetch_ratio_too_small_p implements a
      heuristic that disables prefetching in a loop if the prefetching
      cost is above a certain limit.  The relative prefetching cost is
      estimated by taking the ratio between the prefetch count and the
      total intruction count (this models the I-cache cost).

   The limits used in these heuristics are defined as parameters with
   reasonable default values. Machine-specific default values will be
   added later.

   Some other TODO:
      -- write and use more general reuse analysis (that could be also used
	 in other cache aimed loop optimizations)
      -- make it behave sanely together with the prefetches given by user
	 (now we just ignore them; at the very least we should avoid
	 optimizing loops in that user put his own prefetches)
      -- we assume cache line size alignment of arrays; this could be
	 improved.  */
