     but the structures are relatively small, and using a fixed-size
     array avoids extra indirection.

     There are various ways of getting an ABI descriptor:

     * fndecl_abi (FNDECL) is the ABI of function FNDECL.

     * fntype_abi (FNTYPE) is the ABI of a function with type FNTYPE.

     * crtl->abi is the ABI of the function that we are currently
       compiling to rtl.

     * insn_callee_abi (INSN) is the ABI used by the target of call insn INSN.

     * eh_edge_abi is the "ABI" used when taking an EH edge from an
       exception-throwing statement to an exception handler.  Catching
       exceptions from calls can be treated as an abnormal return from
       those calls, and this ABI therefore describes the ABI of functions
       on such an abnormal return.  Statements that throw non-call
       exceptions can be treated as being implicitly wrapped in a call
       that has such an abnormal return.

       At present, no target needs to support more than one EH ABI.

     * function_abis[N] is the ABI with identifier N.  This can be useful
       when referring back to ABIs that have been collected by number in
       a bitmask, such as after walking function calls in a particular
       region of code.

     * default_function_abi refers specifically to the target's default
       choice of ABI, regardless of which (if any) functions actually
       use it.  This ABI and data derived from it do *not* provide
       globally conservatively-correct information, so it is only
       useful in very specific circumstances.  */
