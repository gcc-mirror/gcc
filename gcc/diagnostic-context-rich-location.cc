	}
      else
	a[i] = i;			// B11
    }
  else
    a[i] = i + 1;			// B12

  it has the following CFG:

	    B2
	   / \
	  V   \
	 B3    \
	/ \     \
       V   V     \
      B4  B5      V
	\ /      B12
	 V
	 B6
	/ \
       V   V
      B7  B11
     / \
    V   V
   B8   B9
     \ /
      V
     B10 (warning here)

  If the STMT that has warning is in B10, the interesting conditions for
  the diagnostic are:
  depth=1: the condition stmt at B6, the edge from B6->B7;
  depth=2: the condition stmt at B2, the edge from B2->B3;

  In order to get the interesting conditions, the key to the heuristic
  is to backtrace the immediate dominator block chain of the current
  block B10, such as, B7, then B6, B3, B2.

  In this basic block dominator chain, identify the single predecessor
  edges, such as B6->B7, and B2->B3.

  For each of the single predecessor edge, the interesting condition is
  embedded in the single predecessor block, and the TRUE/FALSE of this
  condition is embedded in the edge.
