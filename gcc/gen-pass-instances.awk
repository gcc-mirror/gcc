# This Awk script takes passes.def and writes pass-instances.def,
# counting the instances of each kind of pass, adding an instance number
# to everywhere that NEXT_PASS is used.
#
# For example, the single-instanced pass:
#     NEXT_PASS (pass_warn_unused_result);
# becomes this in the output:
#     NEXT_PASS (pass_warn_unused_result, 1);
#
# The various instances of
#   NEXT_PASS (pass_copy_prop);
# become:
#   NEXT_PASS (pass_copy_prop, 1);
# through:
#   NEXT_PASS (pass_copy_prop, 8);
# (currently there are 8 instances of that pass)

# Usage: awk -f gen-pass-instances.awk passes.def
