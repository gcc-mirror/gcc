/* Fixture for one-liner tests exercising multibyte awareness.  For
   simplicity we stick to using two multibyte characters in the test, U+1F602
   == "\xf0\x9f\x98\x82", which uses 4 bytes and 2 display columns, and U+03C0
   == "\xcf\x80", which uses 2 bytes and 1 display column.

   This works with the following 1-line source file:

     .0000000001111111111222222   display
     .1234567890123456789012345   columns
     "SS_foo = P_bar.SS_fieldP;\n"

     .1356789012456789134567891   columns

   Here SS represents the two display columns for the U+1F602 emoji and
   P represents the one display column for the U+03C0 pi symbol.  */
