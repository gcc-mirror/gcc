<body>
Provides the printing attribute classes of the Java Print Service API.
<p>
The package contains the available printing attributes. Some attributes are 
used by the print service implementations to inform about the state of print 
services and print jobs. Other attributes are needs to be provided by the 
user/program to specify how a print job or a document in a print job should 
be printed.
</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> Printing attributes can implement more than one attribute role 
and therefore be used to specify e.g. print request attributes as well as 
document attributes.
