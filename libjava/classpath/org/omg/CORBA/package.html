This package provides the support of <a href="www.omg.org">OMG</a> 
<a href="www.CORBA.org">CORBA</a>; see <a href="#overview">overview</a> 
of the implemented functionality. CORBA is an open, vendor independent 
system that applications use to work together over networks.  Thie purpose 
of this package is to provide CORBA APIs to java programming language, 
including the fully functional Object Request Broker ({@link org.omg.CORBA.ORB}). 

<a name="overview">
<h4>Overview of the currently implemented CORBA functionality</h4>
<p>The CORBA implementation in the Classpath project is now a working prototype.
 This prototype is interoperable with Sun's implementation v 1.4, transferring 
 object references, primitive types, narrow and wide strings, arrays, structures 
 and trees between these two platforms. The thrown exceptions are also transferred 
 and handled. The support for stringified object references (IORs) is implemented.
 The redirection commands works, LOCATION_FORWARD_PERM changing the target address
 until the application is restarted and LOCATION_FORWARD redirecting for the
 current session only. Both Little and Big Endian encoded messages
 are accepted. The encoding of the sent messages is the same as used in the 
 stringified IOR reference of that object or Big Endian, if no such data
 available.
 </p>
  <p>
 The current release supports the Value types that appeared since v 1.3 and are
 something between CORBA structures (no methods, data local) and CORBA objects
 (both methods and data remote). Value type has local data, can have
 local methods and is transferred by value, not by IOR reference. 
 </p>
 <p>
 You can use both request-oriented (based on {@link org.omg.CORBA.Request}) 
 and stream-oriented (based on {@link org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl}) 
 invocation models. The current release includes the working examples, demonstrating
 the client-server communication using both methods. These examples also show, 
 how to use the Classpath naming service. The IDL compiler is not yet written, 
 but as a side effect of the required compatibility, the implementation seems 
 accepting the output of the Sun's 1.3 idlj.</p>
