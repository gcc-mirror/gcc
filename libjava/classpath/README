GNU Classpath README - Last updated: Jul 9, 2004

GNU Classpath, Essential Libraries for Java is a project to create a
free software implementation of the core class libraries for the java
programming language.

Additionally GNU Classpath includes a sub-project called GNU Classpath
Tools whose goal is to provide a number of free replacements for
standard Java development tools like javadoc, javap, javah, and
others.  And a sub-project called GNU Inetlib, an extension library to
provide extra network protocol support (ftp, finger, gopher) for GNU
Classpath, but it can also standalone to ease adding http, imap, pop3
and smtp client support to applictions. These subprojects are normally
released independent from the core libraries.

This is a development snapshot release only and is not for general
purpose use.  GNU Classpath needs to be combine with a proper
development environments to be useable for end users.  Eventually,
these essential libraries for java will work with as many free
compilers and runtimes as possible.

Complete development environments known to be based on GNU Classpath
include (recommended for end users):

	* GCC with GCJ 	(http://gcc.gnu.org/java/)
	* Kaffe		(http://www.kaffe.org/)

Smaller environments (runtime only, no compilers, no tools) which work
with this GNU Classpath releases include
(tested by and recommended for GNU Classpath hackers):

	* JamVM		(http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/)
	* Jikes RVM	(http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikesrvm/)
	* Kissme	(http://kissme.sourceforge.net/)

In general the latest releases of the above VMs will work out of the box
with the latest GNU Classpath release (and in most cases directly with the
development sources from CVS).

Besides combining GNU Classpath with the runtimes and compilers above
you might want to add support for encryption libraries as provided by
GNU Crypto (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-crypto/).
And for additional extension libraries (mail, xml, activation, infobus,
servlet) check out GNU ClasspathX (http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx).

Some tools come with their own customized version of GNU Classpath.
Please check if there is a customised version available for the tool you
use before trying the bare bones GNU Classpath release. We are working with
the tool creators to keep the differences between the core classes as small
as possible. Please tell us if you make GNU Classpath work with a new tool.

Active projects which use modified versions of the Classpath libraries
some of which synchronizes with the Classpath CVS head every couple of weeks:

	* IKVM.NET	(http://www.ikvm.net/)
	* JC		(http://jcvm.sourceforge.net/)
	* JNode		(http://jnode.sourceforge.net/)
	* SableVM       (http://www.sablevm.org)
