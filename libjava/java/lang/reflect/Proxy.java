/**
 * This class allows you to dynamically create an instance of any (or
 * even multiple) interfaces by reflection, and decide at runtime
 * how that instance will behave by giving it an appropriate
 * {@link InvocationHandler}.  Proxy classes serialize specially, so
 * that the proxy object can be reused between VMs, without requiring
 * a persistent copy of the generated class code.
 *
 * <h3>Creation</h3>
 * To create a proxy for some interface Foo:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   InvocationHandler handler = new MyInvocationHandler(...);
 *   Class proxyClass = Proxy.getProxyClass(
 *       Foo.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[] { Foo.class });
 *   Foo f = (Foo) proxyClass
 *       .getConstructor(new Class[] { InvocationHandler.class })
 *       .newInstance(new Object[] { handler });
 * </pre>
 * or more simply:
 * <pre>
 *   Foo f = (Foo) Proxy.newProxyInstance(Foo.class.getClassLoader(),
 *                                        new Class[] { Foo.class },
 *                                        handler);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Dynamic Proxy Classes</h3>
 * A dynamic proxy class is created at runtime, and has the following
 * properties:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>The class is <code>public</code> and <code>final</code>,
 *      and is neither <code>abstract</code> nor an inner class.</li>
 *  <li>The class has no canonical name (there is no formula you can use
 *      to determine or generate its name), but begins with the
 *      sequence "$Proxy".  Abuse this knowledge at your own peril.
 *      (For now, '$' in user identifiers is legal, but it may not
 *      be that way forever. You weren't using '$' in your
 *      identifiers, were you?)</li>
 *  <li>The class extends Proxy, and explicitly implements all the
 *      interfaces specified at creation, in order (this is important
 *      for determining how method invocation is resolved).  Note that
 *      a proxy class implements {@link Serializable}, at least
 *      implicitly, since Proxy does, but true serial behavior
 *      depends on using a serializable invocation handler as well.</li>
 *  <li>If at least one interface is non-public, the proxy class
 *      will be in the same package.  Otherwise, the package is
 *      unspecified.  This will work even if the package is sealed
 *      from user-generated classes, because Proxy classes are
 *      generated by a trusted source.  Meanwhile, the proxy class
 *      belongs to the classloader you designated.</li>
 *  <li>Reflection works as expected: {@link Class#getInterfaces()} and
 *      {@link Class#getMethods()} work as they do on normal classes.</li>
 *  <li>The method {@link #isProxyClass()} will distinguish between
 *      true proxy classes and user extensions of this class.  It only
 *      returns true for classes created by {@link #getProxyClass}.</li>
 *  <li>The {@link ProtectionDomain} of a proxy class is the same as for
 *      bootstrap classes, such as Object or Proxy, since it is created by
 *      a trusted source.  This protection domain will typically be granted
 *      {@link java.security.AllPermission}. But this is not a security
 *      risk, since there are adequate permissions on reflection, which is
 *      the only way to create an instance of the proxy class.</li>
 *  <li>The proxy class contains a single constructor, which takes as
 *      its only argument an {@link InvocationHandler}.  The method
 *      {@link #newInstance} is shorthand to do the necessary
 *      reflection.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Proxy Instances</h3>
 * A proxy instance is an instance of a proxy class.  It has the
 * following properties, many of which follow from the properties of a
 * proxy class listed above:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>For a proxy class with Foo listed as one of its interfaces, the
 *      expression <code>proxy instanceof Foo</code> will return true,
 *      and the expression <code>(Foo) proxy</code> will succeed without
 *      a {@link ClassCastException}.</li>
 *  <li>Each proxy instance has an invocation handler, which can be
 *      accessed by {@link #getInvocationHandler(Object)}.  Any call
 *      to an interface method, including {@link Object#hashcode()},
 *      {@link Object#equals(Object)}, or {@link Object#toString()},
 *      but excluding the public final methods of Object, will be
 *      encoded and passed to the {@link InvocationHandler#invoke}
 *      method of this handler.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Inheritance Issues</h3>
 * A proxy class may inherit a method from more than one interface.
 * The order in which interfaces are listed matters, because it determines
 * which reflected {@link Method} object will be passed to the invocation
 * handler.  This means that the dynamically generated class cannot
 * determine through which interface a method is being invoked.<p>
 *
 * In short, if a method is declared in Object (namely, hashCode,
 * equals, or toString), then Object will be used; otherwise, the
 * leftmost interface that inherits or declares a method will be used,
 * even if it has a more permissive throws clause than what the proxy
 * class is allowed. Thus, in the invocation handler, it is not always
 * safe to assume that every class listed in the throws clause of the
 * passed Method object can safely be thrown; fortunately, the Proxy
 * instance is robust enough to wrap all illegal checked exceptions in
 * {@link UndeclaredThrowableException}.

   *     must be true.</li>
   * <li>All non-public interfaces (if any) must reside in the same
   *     package, or the proxy class would be non-instantiable.  If
   *     there are no non-public interfaces, the package of the proxy
   *     class is unspecified.</li>
   * <li>All interfaces must be compatible - if two declare a method
   *     with the same name and parameters, the return type must be
   *     the same and the throws clause of the proxy class will be
   *     the maximal subset of subclasses of the throws clauses for
   *     each method that is overridden.</li>
   * <li>VM constraints limit the number of interfaces a proxy class
   *     may directly implement (however, the indirect inheritance
   *     of {@link Serializable} does not count against this limit).
   *     Even though most VMs can theoretically have 65535
   *     superinterfaces for a class, the actual limit is smaller
   *     because a class's constant pool is limited to 65535 entries,
