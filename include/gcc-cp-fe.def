	     gcc_type)		/* Argument TYPE.  */

/* Push FUNCTION_DECL as the current (empty) binding level (see
   reactivate_decl).  The current enclosing scope before the call must

GCC_METHOD1 (int /* bool */, push_function,
	     gcc_decl)	     /* Argument FUNCTION_DECL.  */

/* Make DECL visible (again?) within SCOPE.  When SCOPE is NULL, it
   means the current scope; if it is not NULL, it must name a function
   that is currently active, even if not at the top of the binding
   chain.

   This function can be used to make e.g. a global function or
   variable visible in a namespace or local scope (overriding another
   enclosing definition of the same name), but its most common
   expected use of this primitive, that gives it its name, is to make
   declarations visible again after reentering a function scope,
   because when a function is entered with push_function, that does
   NOT make any of the declarations nested in it visible for name
   lookup.

   There is a reason/excuse for that: unlike namespaces and classes,
   G++ doesn't ever have to reenter function scopes, so its name
   resolution infrastructure is not prepared to do that.  But wait,
   there is also a good use for this apparent limitation: a function
   may contain multiple scopes (blocks), and the name may be bound to
   different symbols in each of these scopes.  With this interface, as
   we reenter a function scope, we may choose which symbols to make
   visible for the code snippet, or, if there could be template
   functions in local scopes, for unresolved names in nested template
   class default arguments, or in nested template function signatures.

   As for making a local declaration visible for the code snippet,
   there are two possibilities: a) introduce it upfront, while
   entering the scope for the user expression (see the enter_scope
   callback, called by g++ when encountering the push_user_expression
   pragma), which might save some scope switching and reactivate_decl
   (though this can't be helped if some declarations have to be
   introduced and discarded, because of multiple definitions of the
   same name in different scopes within a function: they have to be
   defined in discriminator order); or b) introduce it when its name
   is looked up, entering the scope, introducing the declaration,
   leaving the scope, and then reactivating the declaration in its
   local scope.

   Here's some more detail on how reactivate_decl works.  Say there's
   a function foo whose body looks like this:

   {
     {
// point 1
       class c {} o __attribute__ ((__used__)); // c  , o
     }
     struct c {
       void f() {
// point 2
       }
     } o __attribute__ ((__used__));            // c_0, o_0
     {
       class c {} p __attribute__ ((__used__)); // c_1, p
// point 3
       o.f();
     }
   }

   When we are about to define class c at point 1, we enter the
   function foo scope, and since no symbols are visible at point 1, we
   proceed to declare class c.  We may then define the class right
   away, or, if we leave the function scope, and we later wish to
   define it, or to define object o, we can reenter the scope and just
   use the previously-obtained gcc_decl to define the class, without
   having to reactivate the declaration.

   Now, if we are to set up the binding context for point 2, we have
   to define c_0::f, and in order to do so, we have to declare and
   define c_0.  Before we can declare c_0, we MUST at least declare c.

     As a general rule, before we can declare or define any local name
     with a discriminator, we have to at least declare any other
     occurrences of the same name in the same enclosing entity with
     lower or absent discriminator.

   So, we declare c, then we leave the function scope and reenter it
   so as to declare c_0 (also with name "c", which is why we have to
   leave and reenter the function scope, otherwise we would get an
   error because of the duplicate definition; g++ will assign a
   discriminator because it still remembers there was an earlier
   declaration of c_0 within the function, it's just no longer in
   scope), then we can define c_0, including its member function f.

   Likewise, if we wish to define o_0, we have to define o first.  If
   we wish to declare (and maybe then define) c_1, we have to at least
   declare (c and then) c_0 first.

   Then, as we set up the binding context to compile a code snippet at
   point 3, we may choose to activate c_1, o_0 and p upfront,
   declaring and discarding c, c_0 and o, and then reentering the
   funciton scope to declare c_1, o_0 and p; or we can wait for oracle
   lookups of c, o or p.  If c is looked up, and the debugger resolves
   c in the scope to c_1, it is expected to enter the function scope
   from the top level, declare c, leave it, reenter it, declare c_0,
   leave it, reenter it, declare c_1, leave it, and then reactivate
   c_1 in the function scope.  If c_1 is needed as a complete type,
   the definition may be given right after the declaration, or the
   scope will have to be reentered in order to define the class.

.  If the code snippet is at point 2, we don't need to (re)activate
   any declaration: nothing from any local scope is visible.  Just
   entering the scope of the class containing member function f
   reactivates the names of its members, including the class name
   itself.  */

   in the qualifying scope will be brought in.

   FLAGS should specify GCC_CP_SYMBOL_USING.  If the current scope is
   a class scope, visibility flags must be supplied.

   Even when TARGET is template dependent, we don't need to specify
   whether or not it is a typename: the supplied declaration (that
   could be a template-dependent type converted to declaration by
   get_type_decl) indicates so.  */

GCC_METHOD2 (int /* bool */, add_using_decl,
	     enum gcc_cp_symbol_kind, /* Argument FLAGS.  */
	     gcc_decl)		      /* Argument TARGET.  */

/* Create a new "decl" in GCC, and bind it in the current binding
   level.  A decl is a declaration, basically a kind of symbol.

   NAME is the name of the new symbol.  SYM_KIND is the kind of
   symbol being requested.  SYM_TYPE is the new symbol's C++ type;
   except for labels, where this is not meaningful and should be
   zero.  If SUBSTITUTION_NAME is not NULL, then a reference to this
   decl in the source will later be substituted with a dereference
   of a variable of the given name.  Otherwise, for symbols having
   an address (e.g., functions), ADDRESS is the address.  FILENAME
   and LINE_NUMBER refer to the symbol's source location.  If this
   is not known, FILENAME can be NULL and LINE_NUMBER can be 0.
   This function returns the new decl.

   Use this function to register typedefs, functions and variables to
   namespace and local binding levels, and typedefs, member functions
   (static or not), and static data members to class binding levels.
   Class members must have their access controls specified with
   GCC_CP_ACCESS_* flags in SYM_KIND.

   Note that, since access controls are disabled, we have no means to
   express private, protected and public.

   There are various flags that can be set in SYM_KIND to specify
   additional semantics.  Look for GCC_CP_FLAGs in the definition of
   enum gcc_cp_symbol_kind in gcc-cp-interface.h.

   In order to define member functions, pass GCC_CP_SYMBOL_FUNCTION in
   SYM_KIND, and a function_type for static member functions or a
   method type for non-static member functions, including constructors
   and destructors.  Use build_function_type to create a function
   type; for a method type, start by creating a function type without
   any compiler-introduced artificial arguments (the implicit this
   pointer, and the __in_chrg added to constructors and destructors,
   and __vtt_parm added to the former), and then use build_method_type
   to create the method type out of the class type and the function
   type.

   For operator functions, set GCC_CP_FLAG_SPECIAL_FUNCTION in
   SYM_KIND, in addition to any other applicable flags, and pass as
   NAME a string starting with the two-character mangling for operator
   name: "ps" for unary plus, "mL" for multiply and assign, *=; etc.
   Use "cv" for type converstion operators (the target type portion
   may be omitted, as it is taken from the return type in SYM_TYPE).
   For operator"", use "li" followed by the identifier (the mangled
   name mandates digits specifying the length of the identifier; if
   present, they determine the end of the identifier, otherwise, the
   identifier extents to the end of the string, so that "li3_Kme" and
   "li_Km" are equivalent).

   Constructors and destructors need special care, because for each
   constructor and destructor there may be multiple clones defined
   internally by the compiler.  With build_decl, you can introduce the
   base declaration of a constructor or a destructor, setting
   GCC_CP_FLAG_SPECIAL_FUNCTION the flag and using names starting with
   capital "C" or "D", respectively, followed by a digit (see below),
   a blank, or NUL ('\0').  DO NOT supply an ADDRESS or a
   SUBSTITUTION_NAME to build_decl, it would be meaningless (and
   rejected) for the base declaration; use define_cdtor_clone to
   introduce the address of each clone.  For constructor templates,
   declare the template with build_decl, and then, for each
   specialization, introduce it with
   build_function_template_specialization, and then define the
   addresses of each of its clones with define_cdtor_clone.

   NAMEs for GCC_CP_FLAG_SPECIAL_FUNCTION:

     NAME    meaning
     C?      constructor base declaration (? may be 1, 2, 4, blank or NUL)
     D?      destructor base declaration (? may be 0, 1, 2, 4, blank or NUL)

   The following information is not necessary to use the API.

   C1 initializes an instance of the class (rather than of derived
   classes), including virtual base classes, whereas C2 initializes a
   sub-object (of the given class type) of an instance of some derived
   class (or a full object that doesn't have any virtual base
   classes).

   D0 and D1 destruct an instance of the class, including virtual base
   classes, but only the former calls operator delete to release the
   object's storage at the end; D2 destructs a sub-object (of the
   given class type) of an instance of a derived class (or a full
   object that doesn't have any virtual base classes).

   The [CD]4 manglings (and symbol definitions) are non-standard, but
   GCC uses them in some cases: rather than assuming they are
   in-charge or not-in-charge, they test the implicit argument that

   NULL, or of TYPE itself otherwise.  DECL may be a function or a

   templates.  TYPE must be a class type (not a template generic).

   The add_friend call cannot introduce a declaration; even if the
   friend is first declared as a friend in the source code, the
   declaration belongs in the enclosing namespace, so it must be
   introduced in that namespace, and the resulting declaration can
   then be made a friend.

   DECL cannot, however, be a member of a template class generic,
   because we have no means to introduce their declarations.  This
   interface has no notion of definitions for template generics.  As a
   consequence, users of this interface must introduce each friend
   template member specialization separately, i.e., instead of:

     template <typename T> friend struct X<T>::M;

   they must be declared as if they were:

     friend struct X<onetype>::M;
     friend struct X<anothertype>::M;
     ... for each specialization of X.


   Specializations of a template can have each others' members as
   friends:

     template <typename T> class foo {
       int f();
       template <typename U> friend int foo<U>::f();
     };

   It wouldn't always be possible to define all specializations of a
   template class before introducing the friend declarations in their
   expanded, per-specialization form.

   In order to simplify such friend declarations, and to enable
   incremental friend declarations as template specializations are
   introduced, add_friend can be called after the befriending class is

   function; and TARGS should list template arguments (e.g. <X>) when
   mtf or tf are to name a template function, or be NULL otherwise.

   Unqualified names and namespace- or class-qualified names can only
   resolve to overloaded functions, to be used in contexts that
   involve overload resolution that cannot be resolved because of
   template-dependent argument or return types, such as call
   expressions with template-dependent arguments, conversion
   expressions to function types with template-dependent argument
   types or the like.  Other cases of unqualified or
   non-template-dependent-qualified names should NOT use this
   function, and use decl_expr to convert the appropriate function or
   object declaration to an expression.

   If ID is the name of a special member function, FLAGS should be
   GCC_CP_SYMBOL_FUNCTION|GCC_CP_FLAG_SPECIAL_FUNCTION, and ID should
   be one of the encodings for special member functions documented in
   build_decl.  Otherwise, FLAGS should be GCC_CP_SYMBOL_MASK, which
   suggests the symbol kind is not known (though we know it is not a
   type).

   If ID denotes a conversion operator, CONV_TYPE should name the
   target type of the conversion.  Otherwise, CONV_TYPE must be
   NULL.  */
