	PR libfortran/90374
	* io/format.c (parse_format_list): Implement the E0 exponent
	width to provide smallest possible width for exponent fields.
	Refactor code for correct parsing and better readability of the
	code.
	* io/io.h (write_real_w0): Change interface to pass in pointer
	to fnode.
	* io/transfer.c: Update all calls to write_real_w0 to use the
	new interface.
	* io/write.c ((write_real_w0): Use the new interface with fnode
	to access both the decimal precision and exponent widths used in
	build_float_string.
	* io/write_float.def (build_float_string): Use the passed in
	exponent width to calculate the used width in the case of E0.
