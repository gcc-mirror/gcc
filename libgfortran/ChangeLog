	PR libgfortran/48852
	* io/write.c: Cleaned up whitespace.
	(write_d, write_e, write_f, write_es, write_en): Use new helper function
	write_float_0. (write_float_0): New helper function.
	(get_precision, select_buffer, select_string, write_float_string): New
	helper functions used in remaining float writing functions. Helper function
	write_float_string now contains code for writing to kind=4 character
	internal units.
	(write_real): Modified to establish working buffers at this level and to
	use new helper functions.
	(write_real_g0): Likewise modified.
	(write_complex): Likewise modified. Gets both float strings before
	output so that final lengths can be determined which allows right
	justifying the complex number with no intervening spaces.
	* io/write_float.def (build_float_string): Renamed from previosly
	output_float, modified to use buffers passed in from higher functions,
	builds a null terminated string of the floating point value. Character
	kind=4 code eliminated.
	(write_infnan): Likewise modified to use incoming buffers and eliminate
	kind=4 related code.
	(OUTPUT_FLOAT_FMT_G): Deleted, functionality moved into FORMAT_FLOAT.
	(FORMAT_FLOAT): Renamed macro from WRITE_FLOAT. Use build_float_string.
	(get_float_string): Renamed from write_float, uses FORMAT_FLOAT macro.
	Buffer allocation removed, now at higher level.

	factor.

2016-03-28  Alessandro Fanfarillo  <fanfarillo.gcc@gmail.com>

	* caf/libcaf.h: caf_stop_numeric and caf_stop_str prototype.
	* caf/single.c: _gfortran_caf_stop_numeric and
	_gfortran_caf_stop_str implementation.

2016-02-23  Jerry DeLisle  <jvdelisle@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR libgfortran/69456
	* io/list_read.c (read_real): If digit is missing from exponent issue
	an error. (parse_real): Likewise and adjusted error message to clarify
	it is part of a complex number.
	(nml_read_obj): Bump item count and add comment that this is used to
	identify which item in a namelist read has a problem.

2016-02-17  Jerry DeLisle  <jvdelisle@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR libgfortran/69651
	* io/list_read.c (push_char4): Fix the pointer usage for xrealloc.

2016-02-15  Jerry DeLisle  <jvdelisle@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR libgfortran/69651
	* io/list_read.c: Entire file trailing spaces removed.
	(CASE_SEPARATORS): Remove '!'.
	(is_separator): Add namelist mode as condition with '!'.
	(push_char): Remove un-needed memset. (push_char4): Likewise and remove
	'new' pointer. (eat_separator): Remove un-needed use of notify_std.
	(read_logical): If '!' bang encountered when not in namelist mode got
	bad_logical to give an error. (read_integer): Likewise reject '!'.
	(read_character): Remove condition testing c = '!' which is now inside
	the is_separator macro. (parse_real): Reject '!' unless in namelist mode.
	(read_complex): Reject '!' unless in namelist mode. (read_real): Likewise
	reject '!'. 

2016-02-12  Jerry DeLisle  <jvdelisle@gcc.gnu.org>

	PR libgfortran/69668
	* io/list_read.c (read_character): Remove code related to DELIM_NONE.

	PR libfortran/68744
	* runtime/backtrace.c: Include gthr.h.
	(show_backtrace): Use __gthread_active_p() to determine whether threads
	are active.  Return if lbstate is NULL.

	instead of msg to avoid -Wformat-security warning.
