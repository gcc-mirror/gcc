# For historical reasons, some targets provide a full set of FP routines
# even if there is native hardware support for some of them.  This file
# is used to define functions that can be implemented directly in hardware.
# For example, an __adddf3 defined by this file will use an FPU addition.
#
# The following variables should be set up before including this file:
#
# hardfp_float_modes: a list of hardware floating-point modes.
#                     e.g. sf df
# hardfp_int_modes: a list of integer modes for which to define conversions;
#		    usually this is "si", since libgcc2.c provides routines
#		    for wider modes
# hardfp_extensions: a list of extensions between hardware floating-point modes,
#                    e.g. sfdf
# hardfp_truncations: a list of truncations between hardware floating-point
#                     modes, e.g. dfsf
#
# If some functions that would otherwise be defined should not be
# defined by this file (typically because the target would compile
# certain operations into a call to the libgcc function, which thus
# needs to be defined elsewhere to use software floating point), also
# define hardfp_exclusions to be a list of those functions,
# e.g. unorddf2.
