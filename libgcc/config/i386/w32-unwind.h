/* This file implements the md_fallback_frame_state_for routine for
   Windows, triggered when the GCC table based unwinding process hits a
   frame for which no unwind info has been registered. This typically
   occurs when raising an exception from a signal handler, because the
   handler is actually called from the OS kernel.

   The basic idea is to detect that we are indeed trying to unwind past a
   signal handler and to fill out the GCC internal unwinding structures for
   the OS kernel frame as if it had been directly called from the
   interrupted context.

   This is all assuming that the code to set the handler asked the kernel
   to pass a pointer to such context information.

   There is three main parts.

   1) The first thing to do is to check if we are in a signal context. If
      not we can just return as there is nothing to do. We are probably on
      some foreign code for which no unwind frame can be found. If this is
      a call from the Windows signal handler, then:

   2) We must get the signal context information. 

      * With the standard exception filter:

      This is on Windows pointed to by an EXCEPTION_POINTERS. We know that
      the signal handle will call an UnhandledExceptionFilter with this
      parameter. The spec for this routine is:

         LONG WINAPI UnhandledExceptionFilter(struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS*);

      So the pointer to struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS must be somewhere on the
      stack.

      This was found experimentally to always be at offset 0 of the context
      frame in all cases handled by this implementation.

      * With the SEH exception handler:

      In this case the signal context is directly on the stack as the SEH
      exception handler has the following prototype:

         DWORD
         SEH_error_handler (PEXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord,
                            PVOID EstablisherFrame,
                            PCONTEXT ContextRecord,
                            PVOID DispatcherContext)

      This was found experimentally to always be at offset 56 of the
      context frame in all cases handled by this implementation.

   3) When we have the signal context we just have to save some registers
      and set the return address based on the program counter (Eip).

   Note that this implementation follows closely the same principles as the
   GNU/Linux and OSF ones.  */
