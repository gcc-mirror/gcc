# Note:
#   Because GCC has its own make rules for crtbegin.o and crtend.o,
#   we cannot use crtbegin.o and crtend.o rules.
#   So we create crtbegin1.o and crtend1.o instead.
#   Make sure the linker script include these two objects
#   for building .ctors/.dtors sections.

# Use -DCRT_BEGIN to create beginning parts of .init and .fini content
# Make sure you are building crtbegin1.o with -O0 optimization,
# otherwise the static function will be optimized out
crtbegin1.o: $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c $(GCC_PASSES) $(CONFIG_H)
	$(GCC_FOR_TARGET) $(INCLUDES) \
	$(CFLAGS) \
	-DCRT_BEGIN \
	-finhibit-size-directive -fno-inline-functions \
	-O0 -c $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c -o crtbegin1.o

# Use -DCRT_END to create ending parts of .init and .fini content
# Make sure you are building crtend1.o with -O0 optimization,
# otherwise the static function will be optimized out
crtend1.o: $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c $(GCC_PASSES) $(CONFIG_H)
	$(GCC_FOR_TARGET) $(INCLUDES) \
	$(CFLAGS) \
	-DCRT_END \
	-finhibit-size-directive -fno-inline-functions \
	-O0 -c $(srcdir)/config/nds32/initfini.c -o crtend1.o

# Use this rule if and only if your crt0.o does not come from library
# Also, be sure to add 'crtzero.o' in extra_parts in libgcc/config.host
# and change STARTFILE_SPEC in nds32.h
#
#crtzero.o: $(srcdir)/config/nds32/crtzero.S $(GCC_PASSES) $(CONFIG_H)
#	$(GCC_FOR_TARGET) $(INCLUDES) \
#	-c $(srcdir)/config/nds32/crtzero.S -o crtzero.o
