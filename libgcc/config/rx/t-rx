# Add functions required by the RX ABI which are not part of
# the normal libgcc sources:

LIB2ADD = $(srcdir)/config/rx/rx-abi-functions.c


# We need special handling of the floating point conversion
# routines, to allow for the varying size of a double:

FPBIT = true
ifeq ($(double_type_size),64)
DPBIT = true
endif
