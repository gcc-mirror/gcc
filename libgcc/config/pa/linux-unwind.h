/* Unfortunately, because of various bugs and changes to the kernel,
   we have several cases to deal with.

   In 2.4, the signal trampoline is 4 words, and (CONTEXT)->ra should
   point directly at the beginning of the trampoline and struct rt_sigframe.

   In <= 2.6.5-rc2-pa3, the signal trampoline is 9 words, and 
   (CONTEXT)->ra points at the 4th word in the trampoline structure.  This 
   is wrong, it should point at the 5th word.  This is fixed in 2.6.5-rc2-pa4.

   To detect these cases, we first take (CONTEXT)->ra, align it to 64-bytes
   to get the beginning of the signal frame, and then check offsets 0, 4
   and 5 to see if we found the beginning of the trampoline.  This will
   tell us how to locate the sigcontext structure.

   Note that with a 2.4 64-bit kernel, the signal context is not properly
   passed back to userspace so the unwind will not work correctly.

   There is also a bug in various glibc versions.  The (CONTEXT)->ra
   for the outermost frame is not marked as undefined, so we need to
   check whether read access is allowed for all the accesses used in
   searching for the signal trampoline.  */
