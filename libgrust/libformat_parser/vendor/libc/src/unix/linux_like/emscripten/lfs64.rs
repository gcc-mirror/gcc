// These functions are variadic in the C ABI since the `mode` argument is "optional".  Variadic
// `extern "C"` functions are unstable in Rust so we cannot write a shim function for these

//
// These aliases are mostly fine though, neither function takes a LFS64-namespaced type as an
// argument, nor do their names clash with any declared types.
