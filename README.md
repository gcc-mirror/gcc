Overview
========
This repository exists as a staging ground for developing candidate
contributions to the GNU Compiler Collection ([GCC]).

Candidate features currently on this site are listed below.  The checked items indicate features 
that are deemed sufficiently functional submitted to the relevant GCC developer mailing list for review.
We welcome user feedback from testing these features.  Unchecked itmes are insufficiently mature to 
submit to GCC.  We welcome code via [pull request] for any listed features or other unsupported
features of the draft Fortran 2015 standard:

- [X] The [teams branch] with experimental support for Fortran 2015 teams. 
- [X] The [download-opencoarrays-mpich branch] modifying GCC's prequisites download script
  to add [OpenCoarrays] and [MPICH] to the list of downloade software.
- [ ] The [issue-#6-iso-fortran-binding-h branch] providing gthe Fortran 2015 `iso_fortran_binding.h` file.

Installation
============
This fork's [releases] are produced from the [teams branch], which expect will be of 
most interest to users.   We recommend building releses usin the [OpenCoarrays] 
installation script as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/opencoarrays
cd oppencoarrays
./install.sh --package gcc \
  --from-url https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/gcc/archive/<release-tag>.tar.gz \
  --install-version teams-20170921
```
where <version-number> and <release-tag> must be replaced with the appropriate strings such as
1.9.2 and teams-20170921, respectively.  The final command above peforms the safest but slowest
build, which could take several hours to complete.  For a speedier build, add the `--disable-bootstrap`,
which might fail if the GCC you are using to build is too old.  Also, for an interactive build,
add `--yes-to-all` to instruct the installer to assume affirmative answers to any queries. If successful,
the above steps will install GCC in the prerequisites/installations subdirectory.  To see additional
installation options, including choosing another installation path, execute `./install.sh --help`.

For access to any Fortran 2015 parallel features, including teams and failed images, build the [MPICH] 
and the [opencoarrays-teams branch]:
of OpenCoarrays:
```bash
git checkout opencoarrays-teams
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<gcc-fork-install-path>/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./install.sh  --package mpich \
   --with-fortran <gcc-fork-install-path>/bin/gfortarn \
   --with-c       <gcc-fork-install-path>/bin/gcc      \
   --with-cpp     <gcc-fork-install-path>/bin/g++
./install.sh  \
   --with-mpi <mpich-install-path> 
```
with appropriate substitutions for the values between angular brackdets (<...>).  Please report
any problems with the above steps on our [issues page].


[GCC mirror] README
===================

This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the files whose
names start with COPYING for copying permission.  The manuals, and
some of the runtime libraries, are under different terms; see the
individual source files for details.

The directory INSTALL contains copies of the installation information
as HTML and plain text.  The source of this information is
gcc/doc/install.texi.  The installation information includes details
of what is included in the GCC sources and what files GCC installs.

See the file gcc/doc/gcc.texi (together with other files that it
includes) for usage and porting information.  An online readable
version of the manual is in the files gcc/doc/gcc.info*.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/ for how to report bugs usefully.

Copyright years on GCC source files may be listed using range
notation, e.g., 1987-2012, indicating that every year in the range,
inclusive, is a copyrightable year that could otherwise be listed
individually.
