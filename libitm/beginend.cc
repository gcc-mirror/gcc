  // concurrently with HW transactions because the latter monitor the serial
  // lock's writer flag and thus abort if another thread is or becomes a

  // transaction is not executing as a HW transaction iff the serial lock is
  // write-locked.  Also, HW transactions monitor the fastpath control
  // variable, so that they will only execute if dispatch_htm is still the
  // current method group.  This allows us to use htm_fastpath and the serial
  // lock's writers flag to reliable determine whether the current thread runs
  // a HW transaction, and thus we do not need to maintain this information in
  // per-thread state.
  // If an uninstrumented code path is not available, we can still run
  // instrumented code from a HW transaction because the HTM fastpath kicks
  // in early in both begin and commit, and the transaction is not canceled.
  // HW transactions might get requests to switch to serial-irrevocable mode,
  // but these can be ignored because the HTM provides all necessary
  // correctness guarantees.  Transactions cannot detect whether they are
