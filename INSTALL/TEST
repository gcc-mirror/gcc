   Before you install egcs, you might wish to run the egcs testsuite;
   this step is optional and may require you to download additional
   software.
   
   First, you must have downloaded the egcs testsuites; the full
   distribution contains testsuites. If you downloaded the "core"
   compiler plus any front ends, then you do not have the testsuites. You
   can download the testsuites from the same site where you downloaded
   the core distribution and language front ends.
   
   Second, you must have a new version of dejagnu on your system;
   dejagnu-1.3 will not work. We have made a [1]dejagnu snapshot
   available in egcs.cygnus.com:/pub/egcs/infrastructure until a new
   version of dejagnu can be released.
   
   Assuming you've got the testsuites unpacked and have installed an
   appropriate dejagnu, you can run the testsuite with "cd objdir; make
   -k check". This may take a long time. Go get some lunch.
   
   The testing process will try to test as many components in the egcs
   distrubution as possible, including the C, C++ and Fortran compiler as
   well as the C++ runtime libraries.
   
   How to interpret test results TBD.
