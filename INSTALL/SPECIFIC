Host/Target specific installation notes for
                        egcs-1.00

alpha*-*-*
No specific installation needs/instructions. 

i?86-*-linux-gnulibc1
You will need binutils-2.8.1.0.15 or newer for exception handling to work. 

i?86-*-sco3.2v5*
The SCO assembler is currently required. The GNU assembler is not up to the
task of switching between ELF and COFF at runtime. 
Unlike various prereleases of GCC, that used '-belf' and defaulted to COFF,
you must now use the '-melf' and '-mcoff' flags to toggle between the two
object file formats. ELF is now the default. 
Look in gcc/config/i386/sco5.h (search for "messy") for additional
OpenServer-specific flags. 

hppa*-hp-hpux*
We highly recommend using gas/binutils-2.8 on all hppa platforms; you may
encounter a variety of problems when using the HP assembler. XXX How to
make sure gcc finds/uses gas. 

hppa*-hp-hpux9
The HP assembler has major problems on this platform. We've tried to work
around the worst of the problems. However, those workarounds may be causing
linker crashes in some circumstances; the workarounds also probably prevent
shared libraries from working. Use the GNU assembler to avoid these
problems. 

The configuration scripts for egcs will also trigger a bug in the hpux9 shell.
To avoid this problem set CONFIG_SHELL to /bin/ksh and SHELL to /bin/ksh in
your environment. 

hppa*-hp-hpux10
For hpux10.20, we highly recommend you pick up the latest sed patch from
HP. HP has two sites which provide patches free of charge. 
US, Canada, Asia-Pacific, and Latin-America 
Europe 

Retrieve patch PHCO_12862. 


The HP assembler on these systems is much better than the hpux9 assembler,
but still has some problems. Most notably the assembler inserts timestamps
into each object file it creates, causing the 3-stage comparison test to fail
during a "make bootstrap". You should be able to continue by saying "make
all" after getting the failure from "make bootstrap". 

m68k-*-nextstep*
You absolutely must use GNU sed and GNU make on this platform. If you try
to build the integrated C++ & C++ runtime libraries on this system you will
run into trouble with include files. The way to get around this is to use the
following sequence. 

cd objdir
make all-texinfo all-bison all-byacc all-binutils all-gas all-ld
cd gcc
make bootstrap
make install-headers-tar
cd ..
make bootstrap3

mips*-sgi-irix4

mips*-sgi-irix5
You must use GAS on these platforms, the native assembler can not handle the
code for exception handling support on this platform. These systems don't have
ranlib, which various components in egcs need; you should be able to avoid this
problem by installing GNU binutils, which includes a functional ranlib for this
system. 


You may get the following warning on irix4 platforms, it can be safely
ignored. 

    warning: foo.o does not have gp tables for all its sections.

powerpc-*-linux-gnu*
You will need binutils-2.8.1.0.17 for a working egcs. It is strongly
recommended to recompile binutils with egcs if you initially built it with
gcc-2.7.2.*.
