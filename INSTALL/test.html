<p>Before you install egcs, you might wish to run the egcs testsuite; this
step is optional and may require you to download additional software.

<p>First, you must have downloaded the egcs testsuites; the full distribution
contains testsuites.  If you downloaded the "core" compiler plus any front
ends, then you do not have the testsuites.  You can download the testsuites
from the same site where you downloaded the core distribution and language
front ends.

<p>Second, you must have a new version of dejagnu on your system; dejagnu-1.3
will not work.  We have made a 
<a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/infrastructure/dejagnu-971222.tar.gz">
dejagnu snapshot</a> available in egcs.cygnus.com:/pub/egcs/infrastructure until
a new version of dejagnu can be released.

<p>Assuming you've got the testsuites unpacked and have installed an appropriate
dejagnu, you can run the testsuite with "cd <i>objdir</i>; make -k check".
This may take a long time.  Go get some lunch.

<p>The testing process will try to test as many components in the egcs
distrubution as possible, including the C, C++ and Fortran compiler as
well as the C++ runtime libraries.

<p> How to interpret test results TBD.
