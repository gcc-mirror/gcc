The D language scripts in this directory are used during the syncing of
libphobos with upstream.  They can be built with the command:

    dub build --single name-of-script.d

Or when dub isn't available:

    gdc -o name-of-script name-of-script.d [any other dependencies].d

Scripts:

gen_druntime_sources.d

    Generates source file definitions for libphobos/libdruntime/Makefile.am.
    Ran from the libdruntime directory and append output to Makefile.am.

    Example:

	cd libdruntime && ../scripts/gen_druntime_sources >> Makefile.am

gen_phobos_sources.d

    Generates source file definitions for libphobos/src/Makefile.am.  Ran from
    the libphobos/src directory and append output to Makefile.am.

    Example:

	cd src && ../scripts/gen_phobos_sources >> Makefile.am

tests_extractor.d

    Searches the given input directory recursively for public unittest blocks
    (annotated with three slashes). The tests will be extracted as one file for
    each source file to the output directory.  Used to regenerate all tests
    cases in testsuite/libphobos.phobos.

    Example:

	./tests_extractor -i ../libphobos/src -o ../testsuite/libphobos.phobos
