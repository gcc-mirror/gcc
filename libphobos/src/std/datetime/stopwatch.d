    Module containing some basic benchmarking and timing functionality.

    For convenience, this module publicly imports $(MREF core,time).

    $(RED Unlike the other modules in std.datetime, this module is not currently
          publicly imported in std.datetime.package, because the old
          versions of this functionality which use
          $(REF TickDuration,core,time) are in std.datetime.package and would
          conflict with the symbols in this module. After the old symbols have
          gone through the deprecation cycle and have been fully removed, then
          this module will be publicly imported in std.datetime.package. The
          old, deprecated symbols has been removed from the documentation in
          December 2019 and currently scheduled to be fully removed from Phobos
          after 2.094.)

    So, for now, when using std.datetime.stopwatch, if other modules from
    std.datetime are needed, then either import them individually rather than
    importing std.datetime, or use selective or static imports to import
    std.datetime.stopwatch. e.g.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    import std.datetime;
    import std.datetime.stopwatch : benchmark, StopWatch;
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The compiler will then know to use the symbols from std.datetime.stopwatch
    rather than the deprecated ones from std.datetime.package.

/++
    Used by StopWatch to indicate whether it should start immediately upon
    construction.

    If set to `AutoStart.no`, then the StopWatch is not started when it is
    constructed.

    Otherwise, if set to `AutoStart.yes`, then the StopWatch is started when
    it is constructed.
  +/
alias AutoStart = Flag!"autoStart";


/++
    StopWatch is used to measure time just like one would do with a physical
    stopwatch, including stopping, restarting, and/or resetting it.

    $(REF MonoTime,core,time) is used to hold the time, and it uses the system's
    monotonic clock, which is high precision and never counts backwards (unlike
    the wall clock time, which $(I can) count backwards, which is why
    $(REF SysTime,std,datetime,systime) should not be used for timing).

    Note that the precision of StopWatch differs from system to system. It is
    impossible for it to be the same for all systems, since the precision of the
    system clock and other system-dependent and situation-dependent factors
    (such as the overhead of a context switch between threads) varies from
    system to system and can affect StopWatch's accuracy.

        $(LREF AutoStart) argument.

        If `StopWatch.init` is used, then the constructed StopWatch isn't
        running (and can't be, since no constructor ran).
