Open File Description locks

Usually record locks held by a process are released on *any* close and are
not inherited across a fork().

These cmd values will set locks that conflict with process-associated
record  locks, but are "owned" by the open file description, not the
process. This means that they are inherited across fork() like BSD (flock)
locks, and they are only released automatically when the last reference to
the open file against which they were acquired is put.
