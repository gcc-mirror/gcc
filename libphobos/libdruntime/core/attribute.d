/**
 * Use this attribute to specify that a global symbol should be emitted with
 * weak linkage. This is primarily useful in defining library functions that
 * can be overridden by user code, though it can also be used with shared and
 * static variables too.
 *
 * The overriding symbol must have the same type as the weak symbol. In
 * addition, if it designates a variable it must also have the same size and
 * alignment as the weak symbol.
 *
 * Quote from the LLVM manual: "Note that weak linkage does not actually allow
 * the optimizer to inline the body of this function into callers because it
 * doesnâ€™t know if this definition of the function is the definitive definition
 * within the program or whether it will be overridden by a stronger
 * definition."
 *
 * This attribute is only meaningful to the GNU and LLVM D compilers. The
 * Digital Mars D compiler emits all symbols with weak linkage by default.

/**
 * Use this attribute to make an Objective-C interface method optional.
 *
 * An optional method is a method that does **not** have to be implemented in
 * the class that implements the interface. To safely call an optional method,
 * a runtime check should be performed to make sure the receiver implements the
 * method.
 *
 * This is a special compiler recognized attribute, it has several
 * requirements, which all will be enforced by the compiler:
 *
 * * The attribute can only be attached to methods which have Objective-C
 *   linkage. That is, a method inside an interface declared as `extern (Objective-C)`
 *
 * * It can only be used for methods that are declared inside an interface
 * * It can only be used once in a method declaration
 * * It cannot be attached to a method that is a template

 * Examples:
 * ---
 * import core.attribute : optional, selector;
 *
 * extern (Objective-C):
 *
 * struct objc_selector;
 * alias SEL = objc_selector*;
 *
 * SEL sel_registerName(in char* str);

/**
 * Use this attribute to declare an ABI tag on a C++ symbol.
 *
 * ABI tag is an attribute introduced by the GNU C++ compiler.
 * It modifies the mangled name of the symbol to incorporate the tag name,
 * in order to distinguish from an earlier version with a different ABI.
 *
 * This is a special compiler recognized attribute, it has a few
 * requirements, which all will be enforced by the compiler:
 *
 * $(UL
 *  $(LI
 *      There can only be one such attribute per symbol.
 *  )
 *  $(LI
 *      The attribute can only be attached to an `extern(C++)` symbol
 *      (`struct`, `class`, `enum`, function, and their templated counterparts).
 *  )
 *  $(LI
 *      The attribute cannot be applied to C++ namespaces.
 *      This is to prevent confusion with the C++ semantic, which allows it to
 *      be applied to namespaces.
 *  )
 *  $(LI
 *      The string arguments must only contain valid characters
 *      for C++ name mangling which currently include alphanumerics
 *      and the underscore character.
 *  )
 * )
 *
 * This UDA is not transitive, and inner scope do not inherit outer scopes'
 * ABI tag. See examples below for how to translate a C++ declaration to D.
 * Also note that entries in this UDA will be automatically sorted
 * alphabetically, hence `gnuAbiTag("c", "b", "a")` will appear as
 * `@gnuAbiTag("a", "b", "c")`.
 *
 * See_Also:
 * $(LINK2 https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangle.abi-tag, Itanium ABI spec)
 * $(LINK2 https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Attributes.html, GCC attributes documentation).

 * Examples:
 * ---
 * // ---- foo.cpp
 * struct [[gnu::abi_tag ("tag1", "tag2")]] Tagged1_2
 * {
 *     struct [[gnu::abi_tag ("tag3")]] Tagged3
 *     {

 * Use this attribute to ensure that values of a `struct` or `union` type are

 *

 * $(UL

 *      the expression is the top-level expression in a statement or the
 *      left-hand expression in a comma expression, and

 *
 * If the declaration of a `struct` or `union` type has the `@mustuse`
 * attribute, the compiler will emit an error any time a value of that type
 * would be discarded.
 *
 * Currently, `@mustuse` is only recognized by the compiler when attached to
 * `struct` and `union` declarations. To allow for future expansion, attaching
 * `@mustuse` to a `class`, `interface`, `enum`, or function declaration is
 * currently forbidden, and will result in a compile-time error. All other uses
 * of `@mustuse` are ignored.

 * Examples:
 * ---
 * @mustuse struct ErrorCode { int value; }
 *
 * extern(C) ErrorCode doSomething();
