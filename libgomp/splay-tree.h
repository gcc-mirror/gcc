/* The splay tree code copied from include/splay-tree.h and adjusted,
   so that all the data lives directly in splay_tree_node_s structure
   and no extra allocations are needed.

   Files including this header should before including it add:
typedef struct splay_tree_node_s *splay_tree_node;
typedef struct splay_tree_s *splay_tree;
typedef struct splay_tree_key_s *splay_tree_key;
   define splay_tree_key_s structure, and define
   splay_compare inline function.

   Alternatively, they can define splay_tree_prefix macro before
   including this header and then all the above types, the
   splay_compare function and the splay_tree_{lookup,insert_remove}
   function will be prefixed by that prefix.  If splay_tree_prefix
   macro is defined, this header must be included twice: once where
   you need the header file definitions, and once where you need the
   .c implementation routines.  In the latter case, you must also
   define the macro splay_tree_c.  See the include of splay-tree.h in
   priority_queue.[hc] for an example.  */

/* For an easily readable description of splay-trees, see:

     Lewis, Harry R. and Denenberg, Larry.  Data Structures and Their
     Algorithms.  Harper-Collins, Inc.  1991.

   The major feature of splay trees is that all basic tree operations
   are amortized O(log n) time for a tree with n nodes.  */
