CONCLUSION
CHAPTER
I
Inter
Relationship
of
the
Two
Worlds
THE
reality
of
an
invisible
world
surrounding
the
physical
world
is
for
many
difficult
to
comprehend
since
the
mind
sphere
is
often
limited
to
the
visible
and
tangible
however
it
requires
but
little
thought
to
realize
the
constant
change
of
matter
as
it
occurs
in
three
forms
solid
liquid
and
gaseous
in
its
range
back
and
forth
between
the
visible
and
invisible
Visible
nature
is
but
the
invisible
the
Real
made
manifest
through
a
combination
of
its
elements
science
informs
us
that
fully
ninety
five
per
cent
of
vegetation
is
derived
out
of
the
air
or
atmosphere
Is
not
mankind
living
at
the
bottom
of
an
invisible
ocean
the
atmosphere
which
is
even
more
important
to
physical
existence
than
any
of
the
visible
physical
substances
since
life
can
continue
but
a
few
moments
out
of
it
Nitrogen
gas
constituting
the
greater
bulk
of
the
atmosphere
enters
vitally
into
vegetable
and
animal
growth
and
existence
Hydrogen
and
oxygen
gases
are
constantly
changing
from
a
state
of
invisible
vapor
to
visible
and
solid
form
Carbon
offers
another
example
of
similar
transformation
Sounds
odors
the
thermic
law
of
heat
and
cold
and
multitudes
of
other
phenomena
ranging
from
the
infinitesimal
electron
to
the
energy
which
moves
the
planets
and
suns
are
all
intangible
invisible
factors
All
activities
whether
chemical
vital
or
mental
operate
invisibly
as
observed
in
chemical
affinity
in
energy
in
plant
life
in
animal
life
in
intelligence
and
mentalization
So
in
every
department
of
our
manifest
physical
nature
it
is
evident
that
all
elements
have
their
root
and
permanence
in
the
invisible
The
invisible
is
the
source
of
the
visible
Thus
when
we
realize
that
the
objective
is
only
a
combination
of
invisible
substances
and
forces
the
existence
of
an
unseen
world
is
readily
comprehensible
Considering
the
wonderful
advancement
of
science
into
the
field
of
nature
s
finer
forces
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
thinking
mind
can
fail
to
recognize
the
rationale
of
the
independent
existence
of
the
human
spirit
apart
for
the
physical
body
No
subject
has
been
better
authenticated
through
the
ages
and
in
all
literature
than
that
of
spirit
existence
and
a
future
life
Fiske
the
historian
says
Among
all
races
of
men
as
far
as
can
now
be
determined
ancestor
worship
contact
with
the
spirits
of
the
departed
was
the
earliest
form
of
worship
prevailing
in
Africa
Asia
China
Japan
among
the
Aryans
of
Europe
and
the
American
Indian
tribes
Allen
in
his
History
of
Civilization
writes
Rude
tribes
the
world
over
are
found
to
have
ideas
of
a
human
soul
a
spirit
world
and
generally
a
belief
in
immortality
Savages
consider
the
next
life
simply
a
continuation
of
this
they
also
recognize
an
other
self
which
has
mysterious
powers
Death
is
the
abandoning
of
the
body
by
this
mysterious
other
self
which
is
conceived
of
as
still
existing
in
the
near
neighborhood
The
loves
and
hates
of
this
world
are
transferred
to
the
spirit
world
Confucius
said
Bemoan
not
the
departed
with
excessive
grief
The
dead
are
devoted
and
faithful
friends
they
are
ever
associated
with
us
The
writers
of
classic
times
Socrates
Herodotus
Sophocles
Euripides
Plato
Aristotle
Horace
Virgil
Plutarch
Josephus
Maximus
of
Tyre
repeatedly
refer
to
spirit
existence
as
a
well
known
fact
Cicero
wrote
Is
not
almost
all
heaven
filled
with
the
human
Those
very
gods
themselves
had
their
original
here
below
and
ascended
from
hence
into
heaven
That
early
Christianity
recognized
spirits
is
too
well
authenticated
in
the
writings
of
St
Anthony
Tertullian
Origen
and
their
contemporaries
to
require
emphasis
The
Bible
is
replete
with
references
to
spirit
existence
We
also
are
compassed
about
with
so
great
a
cloud
of
witnesses
Heb
Beloved
believe
not
every
spirit
but
try
the
spirits
whether
they
are
of
God
John
The
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
Heb
There
is
a
natural
body
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body
First
that
which
is
natural
and
afterward
that
which
is
spiritual
Cor
Many
other
similar
biblical
citations
might
be
given
Swedenborg
contributed
volumes
on
this
subject
Dr
Samuel
Johnson
said
I
do
not
believe
in
spirits
I
have
seen
too
many
of
them
John
Wesley
wrote
in
The
Invisible
World
It
is
true
that
the
English
in
general
indeed
most
of
the
men
of
learning
in
Europe
have
given
up
all
accounts
of
witches
and
apparitions
as
mere
old
wives
fables
I
am
sorry
for
it
and
I
willingly
take
this
opportunity
to
offer
my
solemn
protest
against
this
violent
compliment
which
so
many
that
believe
in
the
Bible
pay
to
those
who
do
not
believe
it
Such
belief
is
in
direct
opposition
not
only
to
the
Bible
but
to
the
suffrage
of
the
wisest
and
best
of
men
in
all
ages
and
nations
They
well
know
that
the
giving
up
of
witchcraft
is
in
effect
giving
up
the
Bible
That
psychic
phenomena
occurred
at
the
house
of
Mr
Samuel
Wesley
father
of
Rev
John
Wesley
at
Epworth
and
continued
with
noises
and
disturbances
of
various
kinds
for
many
months
is
well
known
Shakespeare
Milton
Wordsworth
Tennyson
Longfellow
and
many
other
poets

with
profound
understanding
of
the
continued

We
are

The

not
entitled
to
be
called
a
skeptic
he
is
simply
ignorant
The
Rev
Dr
George
M
Searle
Rector
of
the
Catholic
Church
of
St
Paul
the
Apostle
New
York
City
said
The
reality
of
the
existence
of
spirits
in
modern
spiritism
is
no
longer
an
open
question
even
among
scientific
men
who
have
examined
the
subject
Any
one
who
considers
the
manifestation
of
them
as
mere
humbug
trickery
or
delusion
is
simply
not
up
to
date
In
our
times
no
one
denies
the
real
existence
of
spiritualistic
facts
except
a
few
who
live
with
their
feet
on
the
earth
and
their
brains
in
the
moon
wrote
G
G
Franco
S
J
in
Civilta
Cattolica
Spiritistic
phenomena
are
external
facts
which
fall
within
the
range
of
the
senses
and
can
easily
be
observed
by
all
and
when
such
facts
are
attested
by
so
many
well
informed
and
credible
witnesses
it
is
useless
as
well
as
foolish
and
ridiculous
to
fight
against
proved
evidence
The
facts
remain
assured
even
for
reasonable
men
The
spiritual
world
and
the
physical
world
are
constantly
intermingling
the
spiritual
plane
is
not
a
vague
intangibility
but
is
real
and
natural
a
vast
zone
of
refined
substance
of
activity
and
progress
and
life
there
is
a
continuation
of
life
in
the
physical
world
On
the
physical
plane
of
expression
the
soul
obtains
knowledge
through
experience
and
contact
with
objective
things
and
intelligence
finds
itself
by
manifesting
through
physical
organs
in
the
spiritual
plane
progression
of
the
individual
continues
the
mind
unfolding
along
lines
of
reason
through
spontaneity
of
service
the
attainment
and
appreciation
of
high
ideals
and
an
ever
broadening
conception
of
life
s
purpose
The
change
called
death
the
word
is
a
misnomer
universally
regarded
with
gloomy
fear
occurs
so
naturally
and
simply
that
the
greater
number
after
passing
out
of
the
physical
are
not
aware
that
the
transition
has
been
made
and
having
no
knowledge
of
a
spiritual
life
they
are
totally
unconscious
of
having
passed
into
another
state
of
being
Deprived
of
their
physical
sense
organs
they
are
shut
out
from
the
physical
light
and
lacking
a
mental
perception
of
the
high
purpose
of
existence
these
individuals
are
spiritually
blind
and
find
themselves
in
a
twilight
condition
the
outer
darkness
mentioned
in
the
Bible
and
linger
in
the
realm
known
as
the
Earth
Sphere
Death
does
not
make
a
saint
of
a
sinner
nor
a
sage
of
a
fool
The
mentality
is
the
same
as
before
and
individuals
carry
with
them
their
old
desires
habits
dogmas
faulty
teachings
indifference
or
disbelief
in
a
future
life
As
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
Prov
Assuming

millions
remain

a
time
in

sphere
and
often
in
the
environment
of
their
earth
lives
still
held
by
their
habits
or
interests
Where

Matt
Those
who
have
progressed
to
the
higher
spirit
world
ever
endeavor
to
enlighten
these
earthbound
spirits
but
the
latter
due
to
preconceptions
concerning
the
hereafter
labor
under
the
delusion
that
the
departed
are
dead
or
are
ghosts
and
often
refuse
to
recognize
their
friends
or
to
realize
their
own
condition
Many
are
in
a
state
of
heavy
sleep
others
are
lost
or
confused
troubled
minds
may
be
haunted
by
fear
of
the
strange
darkness
those
conscience
stricken
suffer
in
anguish
or
remorse
for
their
earth
conduct
some
impelled
by
selfish
or
evil
inclinations
seek
an
outlet
for
their
tendencies
remaining
in
this
condition
until
these
destructive
desires
are
outgrown
when
the
soul
cries
out
for
understanding
and
light
and
progressed
spirits
are
able
to
reach
them
and
aid
them
Lacking
physical
bodies
through
which
to
carry
out
earthly
propensities
many
discarnated
intelligences
are
attracted
to
the
magnetic
light
which
emanates
from
mortals
and
consciously
or
unconsciously
attach
themselves
to
these
magnetic
auras
finding
an
avenue
of
expression
through
influencing
obsessing
or
possessing
human
beings
Such
obtruding
spirits
influence
susceptible
sensitives
with
their
thoughts
impart
their
own
emotions
to
them
weaken
their
will
power
and
often
control
their
actions
producing
great
distress
mental
confusion
and
suffering
These
earthbound
spirits
are
the
supposed
devils
of
all
ages
devils
of
human
origin
by
products
of
human
selfishness
false
teachings
and
ignorance
thrust
blindly
into
a
spirit
existence
and
held
there
in
a
bondage
of
ignorance
The
influence
of
these
discarnated
entities
is
the
cause
of
many
of
the
inexplicable
and
obscure
events
of
earth
life
and
of
a
large
part
of
the
world
s
misery
Purity
of
life
and
motive
or
high
intellectuality
do
not
necessarily
offer
protection
from
obsession
recognition
and
knowledge
of
these
problems
are
the
only
safeguards
The
physical
conditions
permitting
this
impingement
are
varied
such
encroachment
is
often
due
to
a
natural
and
prediposed
susceptibility
a
depleted
nervous
system
or
sudden
shock
Physical
derangements
are
conducive
to
obsession
for
when
the
vital
forces
are
lowered
less
resistance
is
offered
and
intruding
spirits
are
allowed
easy
access
although
often
neither
mortal
nor
spirit
is
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
other
This
encroachment
alters
the
characteristics
of
the
sensitive
resulting
in
a
seemingly
changed
personality
sometimes
simulating
multiple
or
dissociated
personalities
and
frequently
causes
apparent
insanity
varying
in
degree
from
a
simple
mental
aberration
to
and
including
all
types
of
dementia
hysteria
epilepsy
melancholia
shell
shock
kleptomania
idiocy
religious
and
suicidal
mania
as
well
as
amnesia
psychic
invalidism
dipsomania
immorality
functional
bestiality
atrocities
and
other
forms
of
criminality
Humanity
is
surrounded
by
the
thought
influence
of
millions
of
discarnate
beings
who
have
not
yet
arrived
at
a
full
realization
of
life
s
higher
purposes
A
recognition
of
this
fact
accounts
for
a
great
portion
of
unbidden
thoughts
emotions
strange
forebodings
gloomy
moods
irritabilities
unreasonable
impulses
irrational
outbursts
of
temper
uncontrollable
infatuations
and
countless
other
mental
vagaries
The
records
of
spirit
obsession
and
possession
extend
from
remotest
antiquity
to
modern
times
Dr
Tyler
the
noted
English
Anthropologist
in
his
Primitive
Culture
says
It
is
not
too
much
to
assert
that
the
doctrine
of
demoniacal
possession
is
kept
up
substantially
the
same
theory
to
account
for
substantially
the
same
facts
by
half
the
human
race
who
thus
stand
as
consistent
representatives
of
their
forefathers
back
in
the
primitive
antiquity
In
Muller
s
Urreligionen
we
find
The
general
belief
of
the
barbaric
world
today
is
that
such
attacks
as
epilepsy
hysteria
delirium
idiocy
and
madness
are
caused
by
some
demon
gaining
control
of
the
body
Homer
referred
repeatedly
to
demons
and
said
A
sick
man
pining
away
is
one
upon
whom
an
evil
spirit
has
gazed
Plato
held
that
demons
obsessed
mortals
Socrates
speaks
directly
of
demons
influencing
the
possessed
insane
Plutarch
wrote
Certain
tyrannical
demons
require
for
their
enjoyment
some
soul
still
incarnate
being
unable
to
satisfy
their
passions
in
any
other
way
incite
to
sedition
lust
wars
of
conquest
and
thus
get
what
they
lust
for
Josephus
says
Demons
are
the
spirits
of
wicked
men
Obsessing
or
possessing
spirits
are
frequently
mentioned
both
in
the
Old
and
New
Testaments
In
I
Samuel
we
read
David
took
an
harp
and
played
with
his
hand
so
Saul
was
refreshed
and
was
well
and
the
evil
spirit
departed
from
him
So
common
was
the
belief
in
spirits
and
spirit
obsession
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
that
the
ability
to
cast
out
evil
spirits
was
considered
one
of
the
most
important
signs
of
genuine
discipleship
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
a
considerable
portion
of
the
work
accredited
to
Jesus
was
the
casting
out
of
demons
A
few
quotations
from
the
New
Testament
will
suffice
Jesus
gave
his
twelve
disciples
power
against
unclean
spirits
to
cast
them
out
Matt
Jesus
preached
and
cast
out
devils
Mark
A
certain
mad
which
had
devils
long
time
Jesus
had
commanded
the
unclean
spirit
to
come
out
of
the
man
He
that
was
possessed
of
the
devils
was
healed
Luke
Vexed
with
unclean
spirits
Luke
The
evil
spirits
went
out
of
them
Acts
Master
I
have
brought
unto
thee
my
son
which
hath
a
dumb
spirit
And
he
asked
his
father
How
long
is
it
ago
since
this
came
unto
him
And
he
said
Of
a
child
Jesus
rebuked
the
foul
spirit
saying
unto
him
Thou
deaf
and
dumb
spirit
I
charge
thee
come
out
of
him
and
enter
no
more
into
him
And
the
spirit
cried
and
rent
him
sore
and
came
out
of
him
and
he
was
as
one
dead
insomuch
that
many
said
He
is
dead
But
Jesus
took
him
by
the
hand
and
lifted
him
up
and
he
arose
Mark
Similar
occurrences
are
not
at
all
uncommon
in
psycho
pathological
research
Among
the
writers
of
early
Christianity
we
find
that
St
Anthony
says
We
walk
in
the
midst
of
demons
who
give
us
evil
thoughts
and
also
in
the
midst
of
good
angels
When
these
latter
are
especially
present
there
is
no
disturbance
no
contention
no
clamor
but
something
so
calm
and
gentle
it
fills
the
soul
with
gladness
The
Lord
is
my
witness
that
after
many
tears
and
fastings
I
have
been
surrounded
by
a
band
of
angels
and
joyfully
joined
in
singing
with
them
Tertullian
with
authority
challenged
the
heathery
to
a
trial
of
superiority
in
the
matter
of
casting
out
demons
Minucius
Felix
a
Roman
advocate
and
apologist
wrote
in
Octavius
There
are
some
insincere
and
vagrant
spirits
degraded
from
their
heavenly
vigor
who
cease
not
now
that
they
are
ruined
themselves
to
ruin
others
Dr
Godfrey
Raupert
of
London
who
several
years
ago
was
especially
delegated
by
Pope
Pius
X
to
lecture
to
Catholic
audiences
in
America
on
Spiritualism
said
in
substance
It
is
no
longer
possible
to
put
the
the
subject
of
psychic
phenomena
aside
The
scientific
men
all
over
the
world
have
recognized
spiritism
as
a
definite
and
real
power
and
to
shelve
it
is
a
dangerous
policy
Consequently
the
Pope
has
asked
me
to
tell
Catholics
the
attitude
to
take
toward
the
subject
The
Church
admits
the
reality
of
these
spiritistic
phenomena
and
their
external
intelligences
in
fact
it
has
always
admitted
their
reality
The
problem
at
present
is
to
discover
the
nature
of
the
intelligence
We
are
now
on
the
borderland
of
new
discoveries
which
may
revolutionize
the
world
It
is
not
the
time
yet
for
an
explanation
of
all
the
phenomena
We
must
suspend
our
judgment
until
the
subject
is
better
known
The
study
of
spiritism
is
a
new
one
and
therefore
dangerous
A
partial
knowledge
of
the
subject
may
cause
grave
dangers
Resulting
in
obsession
or
possession
There
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
of
diabolical
obsessions
in
the
olden
time
That
the
Church
Catholic
recognizes
the
possibilities
is
evidenced
by
the
rules
prepared
for
exorcising
is
the
quoted
statement
of
Monsignor
Lavelle
Rector
of
St
Patrick
s
Cathedral
New
York
Julian
Hawthorne
wrote
in
one
of
the
leading
newspapers
Thousands
of
evil
minded
and
evil
acting
men
and
women
die
every
day
What
becomes
of
their
souls
or
spirits
They
want
to
get
back
here
the
increasing
boldness
and
frequency
with
which
they
take
advantage
of
their
opportunities
is
illustrated
in
many
ways
Two
acts
of
defense
are
open
to
us
We
may
stop
the
source
of
supply
of
these
undesirable
visitors
and
we
may
close
the
doors
Dr
Axel
Gustafson
who
publicly
acclaimed
his
views
regarding
the
fact
of
spirit
obsession
in
quoting
cases
which
had
come
to
his
attention
said
The
spirits
of
the
revengeful
have
power
after
death
to
enter
into
and
possess
the
living
under
certain
conditions
Prof
Herbert
L
Stetson
of
Kalamazoo
College
Michigan
stated
in
a
lecture
at
the
University
of
Chicago
Demon
obsession
is
no
myth
illness
is
often
due
to
demoniacal
possession
Belief
in
demons
is
widespread
I
often
see
the
spirits
who
cause
insanity
is
the
statement
of
Dr
E
N
Webster
of
the
mental
section
of
the
American
Medical
Association
At
times
I
even
hear
their
voices
Insane
persons
who
are
spoken
of
as
hopelessly
insane
are
frequently
lost
under
the
overwhelming
control
of
a
spirit
or
crowd
of
spirits
We
frequently
find
by
post
mortem
examination
that
no
physical
disorder
exists
in
the
brain
or
nervous
system
of
such
persons
Prof
William
James
wrote
in
Proceedings

P
R
That
the
demon
theory
will
have
its
innings
again
is
to
my
mind
absolutely
certain
One
has
to
be
scientific
indeed
to
be
blind
and
ignorant
enough
to
suspect
no
such
possibility
Prof
James
H
Hyslop
while
editor
of
the
Journal
of
the
American
Society
for
Psychical
Research
wrote
There
is
growing
evidence
of
the
fact
of
obsession
which
lies
at
the
basis
of
much
insanity
and
can
be
cured
The
medical
world
will
have
to
wake
up
and
give
attention
to
this
problem
or
materia
medica
will
lose
control
of
the
subject
In
one
of
Prof
Hyslop
s
latest
books
Contact
with
the
Other
World
we
find
the
following
The
existence
of
evil
spirits
affecting
the
living
is
as
clearly
taught
in
the
New
Testament
and
implied
in
the
Old
Testament
as
any
doctrine
there
expounded
The
term
obsession
is
employed
by
psychic
researchers
to
denote
the
abnormal
influence
of
spirits
on
the
living
The
cures
effected
have
required
much
time
and
patience
the
use
of
psychotherapeutics
of
an
unusual
kind
and
the
employment
of
psychics
to
get
into
contact
with
the
obsessing
agents
and
thus
to
release
the
hold
which
such
agents
have
or
to
educate
them
to
voluntary
abandonment
of
their
persecutions
Every
single
case
of
dissociation
and
paranoia
to
which
I
have
applied
cross
reference
has
yielded
to
the
method
and
proved
the
existence
of
foreign
agencies
complicated
with
the
symptoms
of
mental
or
physical
deterioration
It
is
high
time
to
prosecute
experiments
on
a
large
scale
in
a
field
that
promises
to
have
as
much
practical
value
as
any
application
of
the
scalpel
and
the
microscope
In
Modern
Psychical
Phenomena
Dr
Hereward
Carrington
states
It
is
evident
that
spiritual
obsession
is
at
least
a
possibility
which
modern
science
can
no
longer
disregard
while
there
are
many
striking
facts
in
its
support
This
being
so
its
study
becomes
imperative
not
only
from
the
academic
viewpoint
but
also
because
of
the
fact
that
hundreds
and
perhaps
thousands
of
individuals
are
at
the
present
moment
suffering
in
this
manner
and
their
relief
demands
some
immediate
investigation
and
cure
Once
grant
the
theoretical
possibility
of
actual
obsession
and
a
whole
vast
field
of
research
and
investigations
is
opened
up
before
us
which
demands
all
the
care
skill
and
patience
which
modern
enlightenment
and
psychological
understanding
can
furnish
Never
before
in
the
history
of
medical
science
has
there
been
such
widespread
interest
by
the
public
at
large
as
well
as
by
medical
men
and
public
officials
in
the
subject
of
the
cause
treatment
and
cure
of
nervous
and
mental
diseases
Statistics
show
that
insanity
is
increasing
with
alarming
rapidity
everywhere
yet
medical
experts
differ
widely
as
to
the
causes
of
mental
deterioration
and
science
is
not
yet
in
possession
of
knowledge
of
the
exact
etiology
of
functional
insanity
The
whole
world
will
go
mad
before
long
declared
Dr
Winslow
of
England
The
greater
number
of
neurologists
and
alienists
entertain
the
belief
that
the
active
and
underlying
cause
of
insanity
has
its
origin
within
the
deranged
nervous
system
but
very
little
as
yet
is
actually
known
of
the
true
cause
Dr
W
M
L
Coplin
Director
of
the
Bureau
of
Health
and
Charities
Philadelphia
Pennsylvania
said
Insanity
in
most
cases
is
unaccompanied
by
any
perceptible
change
in
the
brain
structure
The
brain
of
the
patient
when
examined
under
a
microscope
shows
absolutely
nothing
which
differs
in
any
way
from
the
appearance
of
the
brain
of
the
perfectly
sane
person
It
is
therefore
evident
that
the
insanity
might
be
due
to
toxemia
the
effect
of
some
subtle
organism
in
the
nature
of
bacilla
Something
causes
insanity
but
what
it
is
we
do
not
yet
know
Dr
Britton
D
Evans
Superintendent
of
the
Morris
Plains
New
Jersey
Insane
Asylum
stated
Brain
tumor
or
brain
fever
may
not
affect
the
mind
A
man
may
have
trouble
of
the
brain
and
still
have
a
normal
mind
Dr
Th
Ziehen
a
noted
German
alienist
and
an
authority
on
hysteria
wrote
For
many
functional
neuroses
there
is
as
yet
no
accurate
limitation
and
definition
As
pathological
anatomy
does
not
aid
us
no
uniform
and
exclusive
cause
for
hysteria
can
be
demonstrated
Dr
William
Hanna
Thomson
physician
to
the
Roosevelt
Hospital
and
Professor
of
the
Practice
of
Medicine
and
Diseases
of
the
Nervous
System
New
York
University
Medical
College
in
referring
to
Tuke
s
Dictionary
of
Psychological
Medicine
asserted
that
The
contributors
to
this

encyclopedia
are

the
most
eminent
professors
experts
and
superintendents
of
insane
asylums
in
Great
Britain
the
United

France
Germany
Hungary
Belgium
Denmark
Switzerland
and
Russia
In
the
articles
by
the
writers
on
kleptomania
dipsomania
chronic
mania
etc
there
is
not
a
word
about
the
pathological
anatomy
because
none
can
be
found
Just
so
it
is
in
the
article
on
melancholia
puerperal
insanity
katatonia
circular
insanity
homicidal
insanity
or
epileptic
insanity
in
none
of
these
is
there
a
word
about
pathological
anatomy
for
the
sufficient
reason
that
not
one
of
these
forms
of
insanity
shows
any
pathological
or
diseased
condition
in
the
brain
different
from
the
sound
brain
of
a
healthy
man
killed
in
an
accident
He
also
said
It
is
high
time
that
we
now
look
in
the
direction
of
toxemia
or
blood
poisoning
for
the
explanation
of
the
insanities
which
produce
no
changes
whatever
in
the
brain
Recent
announcement
was
made
that
a
large
percentage
of
cures
reported
by
the
New
Jersey
State
Hospital
for
the
Insane
at
Trenton
were
effected
by
the
removal
of
diseased
teeth
tonsils
or
affected
organs
In
a
resume
of
the
Trenton
method
Dr
R
S
Copeland
wrote
The
hypothesis
upon
which
this
treatment
is
founded
is
that
insanity
is
a
toxemia
or
poisoning
due
to
germ
infection
in
some
part
of
the
body
If
this
is
true
it
follows
that
removal
of
the
infected
tissue
when
the
case
has
not
gone
too
far
will
be
followed
by
disappearance
of
the
mental
disturbance
When
statistics
compiled
by
the
United
States
Government
as
well
as
by
others
show
that
the
increase
in
the
number
of
the
insane
is
proportionately
greater
than
the
increase
of
the
general
population
it
seems
incongruous
to
credit
decayed
teeth
and
diseased
tonsils
as
being
primary
causes
of
mental
unbalance
at
this
time
when
dental
and
surgical
attention
is
so
general
whereas
the
facts
are
that
when
dentistry
was
little
known
and
practised
and
people
went
about
with
all
conditions
of
decayed
teeth
insanity
was
less
prevalent
than
now
Without
attempting
to
discredit
the
Trenton
reports
it
may
be
stated
that
our
experience
has
shown
that
in
many
cases
of
mental
derangement
although
the
patient
bad
badly
decayed
teeth
mental
balance
was
fully
restored
by
dislodging
the
obsessing
spirit
before
any
attention
was
given
to
the
teeth
Since
it
has
been
found
that
obsessing
spirits
are
sensitive
to
pain
I
am
constrained
to
suggest
that
such
cures
as
announced
by
the
Trenton
Hospital
may
at
least
in
part
be
due
to
the
fact
that
intruding
spirits
were
dislodged
by
dental
or
surgical
interference
To
the
investigator
in
Abnormal
Psychology
on
the
spiritistic
hypothesis
much
of
the
symptomatology
of
the
War
Neurosis
or
shell
shock
excepting
cases
of
malingering
as
recorded
by
Dr
F
E
Williams
Acting
Medical
Director
National
Committee
for
Mental
Hygiene
New
York
City
suggests
obsession
or
possession
by
spirits
of
dead
soldiers
unconscious
of
their
transition
as
the
exciting
cause
This
is
indicated
by
delirium
hallucinations
anxiety
states
functional
heart
disorders
paralysis
tremors
gait
disturbances
convulsive
movements
pain
anesthesia
hyperesthesia
blindness
disorders
of
speech
etc
The
spirit
hypothesis
regarding
War
Neurosis
is
further
evidenced
by
the
rapid
recovery
of
patients
under
severe
electrical
treatment
driving
out
obsessing
entities
as
instituted
by
Dr
Vincent
who
Dr
Williams
stated
would
cure
in
a
few
hours
Patients
that
had
been
in
the
care
of
other
psychiatrists
for
months
and
would
have
them
walking
about
and
climbing
ladders
The
above
theory
is
also
favored
by
Dr
Williams
further
statements
that
This
neurosis
is
rare
among
prisoners
who
have
been
exposed
to
mechanical
shock
as
well
as
among
See

Severe
injury
to
the
central
nervous
system
and

accompanied
by
symptoms
found
in
shell
shock
Success
attends
the
therapeutic
measures
employed
for
the
psychological
rather
than
the
mechanical
side
Diagnosis
should
be
made
and
treatment
begun
at
once
before
the
shell
shock
obsession
becomes
a
fixed
psycho
neurosis
Newspapers
recently
reported
the
case
of
a
young
man
Frank
James
a
boy
thug
of
New
York
City
who
after
a
fall
from
a
motorcycle
when
ten
years
old
changed
from
a
cheerful
affectionate
and
obedient
child
into
a
surly
insolent
boy
developing
into
a
confirmed
robber
and
criminal
After
several
terms
in
the
reformatory
and
five
years
in
Sing
Sing
prison
he
was
declared
hopelessly
insane
and
sent
to
the
State
Insane
Asylum
Frank
James
however
escaped
and
when
pursuers
attempted
his
capture
was
hit
on
the
head
with
a
club
and
falling
unconscious
was
taken
to
a
hospital
The
next
morning
the
boy
awoke
extraordinarily
changed
he
was
gentle
and
deferential
showing
no
further
indications
of
an
unbalanced
mind
and
from
that
time
exhibited
not
the
slightest
impulse
to
commit
crime
of
any
kind
The
article
concludes
Just
what
happened
to
the
mechanism
of
the
boy
s
brain
is
not
entirely
understood
by
medical
men
How
explain
such
a
case
on
the
toxemia
theory
Could
a
blow
on
the
head
eradicate
the
supposed
toxemia
and
restore
mental
balance
The
simple
explanation
from
our
viewpoint
would
be
that
following
the
shock
of
the
boy
s
fall
an
obsessing
spirit
criminal
had
taken
control
of
the
boy
and
that
the
blow
from
the
club
on
the
man
s
head
with
its
accompanying
pain
caused
the
obsessing
entity
to
become
dislodged
The
success
credited
to
hydrotherapy
as
practiced
in
institutions
for
the
insane
especially
when
a
strong
stream
of
water
or
a
continuous
bath
is
used
can
also
be
accounted
for
by
the
dislodgment
of
obsessing
entities
who
object
to
the
discomforts
incident
to
such
treatment
Dr
Prince
in
the
Journal
of
Abnormal
Psychology
wrote
If
we
are
to
establish
sound
principles
underlying
the
mechanism
of
the
mind
we
must
correlate
the
findings
of
all
methods
of
research
experimental
as
well
as
clinical
and
give
due
consideration
to
the
results
obtained
by
all
competent
investigators
After
careful
elimination
of
all
superstitious
notions
and
absurdities
adherent
to
the
subject
of
Normal
and
Abnormal
Psychology
excluding
also
febrile
and
idiopathic
psychoses
or
idiosyncrasies
as
well
as
all
neuro
pathogenic
psychoses
there
still
remains
a
residuum
of
abnormality
in
a
majority
of
cases
of
mental
aberrations
That
alienists
of
renown
and
the
foremost
authorities
widely
disagree
as
to
the
cause
of
insanity
is
sufficient
reason
for
thinking
men
to
investigate
any
theory
which
promises
to
lead
to
results
regardless
of
personal
or
popular
prejudice
The
situation
which
confronts
us
is
a
serious
one
and
nothing
but
the
broadest
toleration
and
liberality
can
cope
with
it
Since
insanity
is
chiefly
a
manifestation
of
mental
or
psychological
disturbance
a
Psychic
neurosis
the
symptomatology
therefore
should
offer
a
guidance
in
ascertaining
the
etiology
and
assist
as
well
in
arriving
at
a
solution
of
the
mental
pathology
This
proposition
however
necessitates
not
only
research
and
study
of
Normal
and
Abnormal
Psychology
but
in
order
to
have
a
complete
premise
also
implies
the
recognition
of
the
duality
of
man
matter
and
spirit
physical
and
spiritual
Insanity
is
not
a
stigma
the
public
attitude
toward
this
affliction
should
be
one
not
of
aversion
but
of
understanding
and
a
realization
of
the
close
inter
relationship
of
the
visible
and
invisible
worlds
Spirit
obsession
is
a
fact
a
perversion
of
a
natural
law
and
is
amply
demonstrable
This
has
been
proven
hundreds
of
times
by
causing
the
supposed
insanity
or
aberration
to
be
temporarily
transferred
from
the
victim
to
a
psychic
sensitive
who
is
trained
for
the
purpose
and
by
this
method
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
psychosis
to
be
an
ignorant
or
mischievous
spirit
whose
identity
may
frequently
be
verified
By
this
method
and
without
detriment
to
the
psychic
it
has
also
proven
possible
to
relieve
the
victim
as
well
as
release
the
entity
from
its
condition
of
spiritual
darkness
through
an
explanation
of
the
laws
governing
the
spirit
world
which
the
experiences
to
follow
will
demonstrate
Inter
communication
between
the
visible
and
invisible
worlds
is
a
natural
privilege
and
is
established
through
a
person
of
a
certain
psychic
constitution
capable
of
acting
as
an
intermediary
through
whom
discarnate
intelligences
can
readily
come
en
rapport
with
the
physical
plane
Of
the
various
phases
of
contact
the
most
valuable
for
research
purposes
is
that
of
unconscious
trance
whereby
direct
communication
may
be
established
with
the
invisible
world
and
the
mental
condition
of
discarnate
intelligences
either
advanced
or
ignorant
may
be
ascertained
Ignorant
psychic
experimentation
may
prove
injurious
when
dabbled
in
by
those
who
neglect
the
necessary
precautions
and
lack
understanding
of
the
laws
which
govern
the
subject
just
as
ignorance
and
disregard
of
the
laws
governing
everyday
life
may
prove
dangerous
The
misuse
of
a
thing
is
no
argument
against
its
use
Psychical
Research
belongs
especially
to
the
domain
of
science
common
sense
and
discrimination
are
essentials
in
all
such
experimental
work
as
well
as
a
thorough
mastery
of
the
laws
involved
Under
these
conditions
scientific
research
becomes
an
invaluable
factor
in
the
investigation
of
Spiritual
Science
CHAPTER
II
Psychical
Research
PSYCHICAL
Research
contains
elements
of
the
greatest
importance
to
humanity
and
has
already
become
a
vital
factor
in
the
social
life
of
the
world
at
large
It
is
undoubtedly
true
however
that
the
various
branches
of
research
are
endeavoring
to
classify
their
findings
on
purely
psychophysiological
bases
The
Psycho
Analyst
advances
the
theory
that
many
of
the
psychoses
have
their
seat
or
origin
in
some
psychic
lesion
or
trauma
either
concealed
or
forgotten
The
Analytical
Pychologist
by
mental
measurements
and
intelligence
tests
is
making
the
segregation
and
classification
of
mental
defectives
possible
So
also
the
Neurologist
and
Psychiatrist
are
diligently
seeking
to
isolate
the
etiological
factors
in
the
various
neuroses
mental
aberrations
and
insanities
and
to
ascertain
the
best
methods
of
prevention
and
treatment
While
these
branches
of
research
are
loath
to
accept
the
hypothesis
of
discarnate
intelligences
as
contributing
exciting
factors
in
many
of
the
psychoses
and
aberrations
they
are
nevertheless
rendering
important
service
in
uncovering
and
bringing
to
light
the
unstable
qualities
in
the
neurotic
the
susceptible
and
those
predisposed
to
mental
unbalance
Psychical
Research
presents
two
general
phases
for
investigation
the
Normal
and
the
Abnormal
The
Normal
phase
from
the
standpoint
of
the
physician
as
well
as
the
minister
deals
among
other
issues
with
the
question
What
becomes
of
the
Dead
This
problem
is
of
vital
interest
to
the
patient
who
lingers
on
the
borderland
of
transition
doubtful
of
the
future
or
perhaps
trembling
in
fear
of
his
probable
condition
after
the
tomorrow
of
death
Should
it
not
be
the
noblest
part
of
the
physician
s
calling
in
such
situations
to
be
in
a
position
to
assure
his
patient
from
actual
knowledge
that
there
is
no
death
but
a
birth
into
new
fields
of
activity
and
opportunities
in
the
higher
mental
spheres
In
the
Abnormal
phase
of
Psychical
Research
there
is
demand
for
broadest
Possible
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
physician
pertaining
to
the
mysterious
functioning
of
minds
discarnated
as
well
as
incarnated
Research
in
Abnormal
as
well
as
Normal
psychology
indubitably
indicates
not
only
the
existence
of
spirits
but
also
unquestionably
demonstrates
that
such
entities
play
an
important
role
in
the
various
psychoneuroses
and
insanities
The
physician
undoubtedly
comes
in
more
intimate
touch
with
the
consequences
of
promiscuous
dabbling
in
Psychical
Research
so
frequently
resulting
in
mental
aberrations
than
any
other
person
for
he
is
usually
the
first
one
to
be
called
into
consultation
and
upon
his
decision
depends
largely
the
disposal
of
such
an
unfortunate
victim
For
this
reason
if
no
other
it
should
surely
be
not
only
the
privilege
but
also
the
urgent
duty
of
the
physician
to
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
various
phases
of
Psychical
Research
particularly
its
dangers
in
the
hands
of
thoughtless
investigators
especially
the
predisposed
psycho
neurotic
The
alarming
results
often
occurring
in
connection
with
Psychical
Research
prompted
me
to
follow
up
a
line
of
investigation
to
ascertain
the
underlying
causes
thereof
for
these
also
concern
the
physician
The
serious
problem
of
alienation
and
mental
derangement
attending
ignorant
psychic
experiments
was
first
brought
to
my
attention
by
the
cases
of
several
persons
whose
seemingly
harmless
experiences
with
automatic
writing
and
the
Ouija
Board
resulted
in
such
wild
insanity
that
committment
to
asylums
was
necessitated
The
first
of
these
cases
was
that
of
Mrs
Bl
whose
attempts
at
automatic
writing
led
to
mental
derangement
and
altered
personality
Normally
she
was
amiable
pious
quiet
and
refined
but
became
boisterous
and
noisy
romped
about
and
danced
used
vile
language
and
claiming
she
was
an
actress
insisted
upon
dressing
for
the
stage
saying
that
she
had
to
be
at
the
theatre
at
a
certain
time
or
lose
her
position
Finally
she
became
so
irresponsible
that
she
was
placed
in
an
asylum
Another
case
was
Mrs
Bn
who
through
the
practice
of
automatic
writing
changed
from
an
artist
and
a
lady
of
refinement
to
an
altogether
different
and
violent
personality
Screaming
at
the
top
of
her
voice
she
continually
rubbed
her
temples
and
exclaimed
God
save
me
God
save
me
Rushing
into
the
street
she
knelt
in
the
mud
praying
and
refused
food
declaring
that
if
she
should
eat
before
six
o
clock
P
M
she
would
go
to
hell
Mrs
Sr
who
bad
followed
the
same
practices
also
became
mentally
deranged
and
violent
necessitating
police
interference
Rising
in
the
night
she
posed
in
the
window
of
her
millinery
shop
as
Napoleon
whom
she
presumed
herself
to
be
and
after
committing
many
other
irresponsible
acts
requiring
restraint
was
sent
to
the
Detention
Hospital
In
like
manner
Mrs
Wr
became
obsessed
with
hallucinations
that
God
was
constantly
talking
to
her
and
condemning
her
for
wrong
acts
of
which
he
accused
her
after
attempting
suicide
at
the
request
of
this
so
called
God
she
was
taken
to
the
asylum
Many
other
disastrous
results
which
followed
the
use
of
the
supposedly
innocent
Ouija
Board
came
to
my
notice
and
my
observations
led
me
into
research
in
psychic
phenomena
for
a
possible
explanation
of
these
strange
occurrences
My
wife
proved
to
be
an
excellent
psychic
intermediary
and
was
easily
controlled
by
discarnate
intelligences
In
answer
to
her
doubts
concerning
the
right
of
disturbing
the
dead
these
intelligences
asserted
that
a
grievously
wrong
conception
existed
among
mortals
regarding
the
conditions
prevailing
after
death
They
stated
that
there
is
in
reality
no
death
but
a
natural
transition
from
the
visible
to
the
invisible
world
and
that
advanced
spirits
are
ever
striving
to
communicate
with
mortals
to
enlighten
them
concerning
the
higher
possibilities
which
await
the
progressive
spirit
But
death
the
freeing
of
the
spirit
from
the
body
is
so
simple
and
natural
that
a
great
majority
do
not
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
realize
the
change
and
owing
to
a
lack
of
education
concerning
the
spiritual
side
of
their
natures
they
continue
to
remain
in
their
earthly
haunts
They
maintained
that
many
such
spirits
were
attracted
to
the
magnetic
aura
of
mortals
although
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
mortal
might
be
unconscious
of
the
intrusion
and
thus
by
obsessing
or
possessing
their
victims
they
ignorantly
or
maliciously
became
the
cause
of
untold
mischief
often
producing
invalidism
immorality
crime
and
seeming
insanity
The
risk
of
interference
from
this
source
constituted
they
said
the
gravest
danger
to
the
unwary
novice
in
psychic
research
but
to
be
in
ignorance
of
these
facts
was
an
even
greater
risk
especially
in
the
case
of
the
susceptible
neurotic
These
intelligences
also
stated
that
by
a
system
of
transfer
that
is
by
attracting
such
obsessing
entities
from
the
victim
to
a
psychic
intermediary
the
correctness
of
the
hypothesis
could
be
demonstrated
and
conditions
could
be
shown
as
they
actually
exist
After
this
transference
of
psychoses
the
victims
would
be
relieved
and
the
obsessing
spirits
could
then
be
reached
by
the
advanced
spirits
who
would
care
for
them
and
instruct
them
regarding
the
higher
laws
of
life
They
claimed
they
had
found
my
wife
to
be
a
suitable
instrument
for
such
experimentation
and
proposed
that
if
I
would
cooperate
with
them
by
caring
for
and
instructing
these
ignorant
spirits
as
they
allowed
them
to
take
temporary
but
complete
possession
of
my
wife
s
body
without
any
injury
to
her
they
would
prove
their
assertions
were
correct
Desirous
of
learning
the
truth
or
falsity
of
such
important
claims
which
if
true
would
have
a
great
bearing
on
the
cause
of
much
that
is
otherwise
baffling
in
criminology
as
well
as
in
psycho
pathology
we
accepted
what
seemed
a
hazardous
undertaking
In
order
to
carry
out
their
purpose
the
Guiding
Intelligences
allowed
many
manifestations
to
take
place
often
very
unexpectedly
and
some
of
these
occurred
while
I
was
pursuing
my
early
medical
studies
One
day
I
left
home
without
any
intention
of
immediately
beginning
my
first
dissecting
work
therefore
my
wife
s
subconscious
mind
could
not
possibly
have
taken
any
part
in
what
transpired
later
The
students
were
required
to
dissect
a
lateral
half
of
a
body
the
first
subject
was
a
man
about
sixty
years
of
age
and
that
afternoon
I
began
dissecting
on
a
lower
limb
I
returned
home
at
about
five
o
clock
and
had
scarcely
entered
the
door
when
my
wife
was
apparently
taken
with
a
sudden
illness
and
complaining
of
feeling
strange
staggered
as
though
about
to
fall
As
I
placed
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
drew
herself
up
and
became
entranced
by
a
foreign
intelligence
who
said
with
threatening
gesture
What
do
you
mean
by
cutting
me
I
answered
that
I
was
not
aware
of
cutting
any
one
but
the
spirit
angrily
replied
Of
course
you
are
You
are
cutting
on
my
leg
Realizing
that
the
spirit
owner
of
the
body
on
which
I
had
been
operating
had
followed
me
home
I
began
to
parley
with
him
first
placing
my
wife
in
a
chair
To
this
the
spirit
vigorously
objected
saying
that
I
had
no
business
to
touch
him
To
my
answer
that
I
had
a
right
to
touch
my
own
wife
the
entity
retorted
Your
wife
What
are
you
talking
about
I
am
no
woman
I
m
a
man
I
explained
that
he
had
passed
out
of
his
physical
body
and
was
controlling
the
body
of
my
wife
and
that
his
spirit
was
here
and
his
body
at
the
college
When
he
finally
seemed
to
realize
this
I
said
Suppose
I
were
now
cutting
on
your
body
at
the
college
that
could
not
kill
you
since
you
yourself
are
here
The
spirit
admitted
that
this
seemed
reasonable
and
said
I
guess
I
must
be
what
they
call
dead
so
I
won
t
have
any
more
use
for
my
old
body
If
you
can
learn
anything
by
cutting
on
it
go
ahead
and
cut
away
Then
he
added
suddenly
Say
Mister
give
me
a
chew
of
tobacco
I
told
him
that
I
had
none
and
then
he
begged
for
a
pipe
saying
I
m
dying
for
a
smoke
This
request
was
of
course
also
refused
The
fact
that
Mrs
Wickland
has
always
abhorred
the
sight
of
any
one
chewing
tobacco
precludes
the
possibility
of
her
subconscious
mind
playing
any
role
in
this
episode
After
a
more
detailed
explanation
of
the
fact
that
he
was
actually
so
called
dead
the
spirit
realized
his
true
condition
and
left
Subsequent
examination
of
the
teeth
of
the
cadaver
indicated
that
the
man
had
been
an
inveterate
tobacco
user
in
life
Upon
another
occasion
when
I
had
been
appointed
assistant
demonstrator
for
a
class
of
students
in
dissecting
the
body
of
a
colored
man
had
been
selected
as
a
subject
but
the
body
had
not
yet
been
disturbed
when
one
evening
Mrs
Wickland
became
entranced
and
a
strange
spirit
speaking
through
her
exclaimed
You
ain
t
goin
to
cut
on
dis
colored
man
Boss
I
told
him
that
the
world
called
him
dead
that
he
was
not
in
his
old
body
but
was
now
controlling
a
woman
s
body
He
would
not
believe
this
and
when
I
showed
him
my
wife
s
hands
saying
they
were
not
colored
but
white
he
replied
I
se
got
whitewash
on
dem
whitewashin
is
my
business
This
spirit
proved
to
be
very
obstinate
offering
a
variety
of
excuses
and
explanations
rather
than
accept
the
truth
but
he
was
finally
convinced
and
departed
Another
incident
will
still
further
demonstrate
to
what
a
seemingly
unbelievable
degree
spirits
may
cling
to
their
earthly
bodies
through
ignorance
of
their
transition
or
so
called
death
In
the
dissecting
room
was
the
body
of
a
woman
about
forty
years
of
age
who
had
died
at
the
Cook
County
Hospital
Chicago
the
previous
June
In
January
seven
months
after
her
death
a
number
of
students
myself
included
were
assigned
this
subject
for
dissection
I
could
not
be
present
the
first
evening
but
the
others
began
their
work
Nothing
was
ever
said
to
me
of
what
occurred
during
those
few
hours
but
for
some
reason
unknown
to
me
the
other
students
never
touched
that
subject
again
The
next
day
there
was
no
school
in
the
afternoon
so
I
began
to
dissect
alone
working
on
the
arm
and
neck
The
dissecting
room
was
in
the
rear
of
a
long
basement
and
very
quiet
but
once
I
distinctly
heard
a
voice
say
Don
t
murder
me
The
voice
sounded
faintly
as
from
a
distance
but
since
I
am
not
in
the
least
superstitious
and
not
at
all
inclined
to
credit
small
incidents
to
the
actions
of
spirits
I
concluded
that
it
probably
came
from
children
in
the
street
although
I
had
not
heard
any
playing
nearby
The
following
afternoon
I
was
again
working
alone
when
I
was
rather
startled
by
a
rustling
sound
coming
from
a
crumpled
newspaper
lying
on
the
floor
a
sound
something
like
that
produced
when
a
newspaper
is
crushed
but
I
paid
no
particular
attention
to
it
and
did
not
mention
these
occurrences
to
my
wife
The
episodes
had
quite
passed
out
of
my
mind
until
a
few
days
later
We
were
holding
a
psychic
circle
in
our
home
and
our
invisible
co
workers
had
already
departed
when
I
noticed
that
my
wife
still
remained
in
a
semi
comatose
condition
I
stepped
up
to
her
to
ascertain
the
reason
when
the
controlling
spirit
rose
suddenly
struck
at
me
angrily
and
said
I
have
some
bones
to
pick
with
you
After
a
period
of
struggle
with
the
stranger
I
asked
what
the
trouble
was
Why
do
you
want
to
kill
me
the
entity
demanded
I
am
not
killing
any
one
I
answered
Yes
you
are
you
are
cutting
on
my
arm
and
neck
I
shouted
at
you
not
to
murder
me
and
I
struck
that
paper
on
the
floor
to
frighten
you
but
you
wouldn
t
pay
any
attention
Then
laughing
boisterously
the
spirit
added
with
great
hilarity
But
I
seared
the
other
fellows
It
was
necessary
to
explain
at
great
length
the
actual
situation
of
the
spirit
who
said
her
name
was
Minnie
Morgan
but
finally
she
understood
and
left
promising
to
seek
a
higher
life
The
ease
with
which
spirits
assume
control
of
the
psychic
intermediary
Mrs
Wickland
is
so
perfect
that
the
majority
of
them
at
first
fail
to
comprehend
the
fact
that
they
are
so
called
dead
and
are
temporarily
occupying
the
body
of
another
Those
intelligences
whose
reasoning
faculties
are
alert
can
See
Chapter
Page
Spirit
Minnie
Morgan
generally
be
made
to
realize
that
their
situation
is
unusual
when
attention
is
called
to
the
dissimilarity
between
their
own
former
bodily
features
hands
and
feet
as
well
as
clothes
and
those
of
the
psychic
This
is
especially
so
when
the
spirit
is
a
man
for
the
difference
will
then
be
more
readily
noticed
Following
the
statement
that
the
body
which
is
being
controlled
belongs
to
my
wife
spirits
usually
retort
I
am
not
your
wife
and
a
great
deal
of
explanation
is
required
before
they
can
be
brought
to
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
they
are
in
temporary
possession
of
another
s
body
On
the
other
hand
there
are
spirits
fixed
and
rooted
in
obstinate
skepticism
who
stubbornly
refuse
to
understand
that
they
have
made
the
transition
out
of
the
physical
These
will
not
listen
to
reason
and
fail
to
be
convinced
of
their
changed
condition
even
when
a
mirror
is
held
before
them
declaring
that
they
have
been
hypnotized
and
prove
so
obdurate
that
they
must
be
forced
to
leave
and
are
taken
in
charge
by
the
invisible
co
workers
The
transference
of
the
mental
aberration
or
psychosis
from
a
patient
to
the
psychic
intermediary
Mrs
Wickland
is
facilitated
by
the
use
of
static
electricity
which
is
applied
to
the
patient
frequently
in
the
presence
of
the
psychic
Although
this
electricity
is
harmless
to
the
patient
it
is
exceedingly
effective
for
the
obsessing
spirit
cannot
long
resist
such
electrical
treatment
and
is
dislodged
Induced
by
our
invisible
helpers
the
spirit
may
then
entrance
the
psychic
when
it
becomes
possible
to
come
into
direct
contact
with
the
entity
and
an
endeavor
is
made
to
bring
him
to
a
realization
of
his
true
condition
and
of
his
higher
possibilities
He
is
then
removed
and
cared
for
by
the
advanced
spirits
and
Mrs
Wickland
again
returns
to
her
normal
self
In
many
cases
remarkable
evidence
that
discarnated
entities
were
the
offending
cause
of
aberration
has
been
obtained
by
a
system
of
experimental
concentration
in
a
psychic
circle
Obsessing
spirits
have
been
dislodged
from
victims
frequently
residing
at
a
distance
conveyed
to
the
circle
by
the
co
operating
intelligences
and
allowed
to
control
the
psychic
Such
spirits
often
complain
of
having
been
driven
away
yet
are
ignorant
of
being
spirits
or
of
having
controlled
or
influenced
anyone
But
the
similarity
between
the
actions
of
the
controlling
spirit
and
the
symptoms
of
the
patient
as
well
as
the
relief
obtained
by
the
latter
through
this
removal
indubitably
prove
the
spirit
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
In
many
cases
the
identity
of
the
spirit
has
been
unquestionably
authenticated
After
this
transfer
and
permanent
dislodgment
of
the
obsessing
spirit
the
patient
gradually
recovers
although
there
may
be
a
number
of
spirits
requiring
removal
from
the
same
patient
It
may
be
asked
why
advanced
intelligences
do
not
take
charge
of
earthbound
spirits
and
convert
them
without
having
them
first
control
a
psychic
intermediary
Many
of
these
ignorant
spirits
cannot
be
reached
by
the
intelligent
spirits
until
they
come
in
contact
with
physical
conditions
when
they
are
compelled
to
realize
their
own
situation
and
are
then
started
on
the
road
to
progression
While
the
control
of
the
Psychic
by
an
ignorant
spirit
in
a
circle
generally
brings
the
spirit
to
an
understanding
and
is
of
interest
to
the
investigator
at
the
same
time
groups
of
other
spirits
in
darkness
are
brought
to
profit
by
the
lesson
conveyed
through
the
actions
of
the
controlling
spirit
Many
controlling
spirits
act
as
if
demented
and
are
difficult
to
reason
with
this
condition
being
due
to
false
doctrines
fixed
ideas
and
various
notions
imbibed
in
physical
life
They
are
often
unruly
and
boisterous
when
it
is
necessary
to
control
them
by
holding
the
hands
of
the
psychic
to
keep
them
in
restraint
Upon
realizing
their
true
condition
many
spirits
experience
a
sensation
of
dying
which
signifies
that
they
are
losing
control
of
the
psychic
Other
spirits
again
are
in
a
sleepy
stupor
wishing
to
be
left
alone
and
severe
language
is
at
times
required
to
arouse
them
as
will
be
observed
in
the
records
following
In
these
records
reference
is
often
made
to
a
dungeon
in
which
refractory
spirits
may
be
placed
and
controlling
spirits
sometimes
complain
of
having
been
kept
in
a
dungeon
Due
to
a
certain
psychic
law
intelligent
spirits
have
the
faculty
of
placing
about
an
ignorant
spirit
a
condition
simulating
a
prison
an
impenetrable
cell
like
room
from
which
there
is
no
escape
Herein
stubborn
spirits
must
stay
seeing
nothing
but
the
reflection
of
their
own
personalities
their
past
actions
appearing
before
the
mind
s
eye
until
they
become
repentant
and
show
a
willingness
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
new
condition
and
to
conform
to
the
spiritual
laws
of
progression
The
nature
of
Mrs
Wickland
s
psychism
is
that
of
unconscious
trance
her
eyes
are
closed
and
her
own
mentality
is
held
in
abeyance
in
a
sleep
state
for
the
time
being
She
herself
has
no
recollection
of
anything
that
transpires
during
this
period
Mrs
Wickland
is
not
subject
to
any
negativism
between
these
experiences
she
is
at
all
times
her
rational
self
clear
minded
and
positive
and
after
thirty
five
years
of
psychic
work
has
not
suffered
impairment
or
detriment
of
any
kind
She
is
constantly
protected
from
the
invisible
side
by
the
supervision
of
a
group
of
strong
intelligences
known
as
The
Mercy
Band
which
is
guiding
this
work
endeavoring
to
bring
humanity
to
a
realization
of
the
simplicity
of
the
transition
called
death
and
the
importance
of
a
rational
understanding
of
what
becomes
of
the
spirits
The
purpose
of
our
work
has
been
to
obtain
reliable
and
incontestable
evidence
at
first
hand
regarding
after
death
conditions
and
detailed
reports
of
hundreds
of
experiences
have
been
stenographically
made
in
order
to
record
the
exact
situation
of
the
communicating
intelligences
CHAPTER
III
Subconscious
Mind
and
Auto
Suggestion
Hypotheses
Untenable
DURING
thirty
years
of
indefatigable
research
among
the
dead
such
startling
conditions
have
been
revealed
that
it
seems
incredible
intelligent
reasoners
along
other
lines
of
thought
could
have
so
long
ignored
the
simple
facts
which
can
so
readily
be
verified
There
is
utter
impossibility
of
fraud
in
these
experiences
foreign
languages
totally
unknown
to
Mrs
Wickland
are
spoken
expressions
never
heard
by
her
are
used
while
the
identity
of
the
controlling
spirits
has
again
and
again
been
verified
and
corroborations
innumerable
have
been
made
On
one
occasion
I
conversed
with
twenty
one
different
spirits
who
spoke
through
my
wife
the
majority
giving
me
satisfactory
evidence
of
being
certain
friends
and
relatives
known
to
me
while
they
were
incarnated
In
all
they
spoke
six
different
languages
while
my
wife
speaks
only
Swedish
and
English
From
one
patient
Mrs
A
who
was
brought
to
us
from
Chicago
thirteen
different
spirits
were
dislodged
and
allowed
to
control
Mrs
Wickland
and
of
these
seven
were
recognized
by
the
patient
s
mother
Mrs
H
W
as
relatives
or
friends
well
known
to
her
during
their
earth
lives
One
was
a
minister
formerly
pastor
of
the
Methodist
church
of
which
Mrs
H
W
was
a
member
who
had
been
killed
in
a
railroad
accident
nine
years
previous
but
was
still
unconscious
of
the
fact
another
was
her
sister
in
law
there
were
also
three
elderly
women
family
friends
for
years
a
neighbor
boy
and
the
mother
in
law
of
the
patient
all
entirely
unknown
to
Mrs
Wickland
Mrs
H
W
conversed
at
length
with
each
one
as
they
spoke
through
Mrs
Wickland
verifying
innumerable
statements
made
by
the
spirits
and
assisted
in
bringing
them
to
a
realization
of
their
changed
condition
and
of
the
fact
that
they
had
been
obsessing
her
daughter
This
patient
is
today
entirely
well
and
actively
occupied
with
social
musical
and
family
affairs
Another
case
will
show
clearly
the
transfer
of
psychosis
from
patient
to
intermediary

the
impossibility

conscious
mind
or
multiple
personalities
playing
any
role
as
far
as
the
psychic
is
concerned
One
summer
evening
we
were
called
to
the
home
of
Mrs
M
a
lady
of
culture
and
refinement
she
was
a
musician
of
high
rank
and
when
the
social
demands
made
upon
her
proved
too
great
she
suffered
a
nervous
breakdown
She
had
become
intractable
and
for
six
weeks
had
been
in
such
a
raving
condition
that
her
physicians
had
been
unable
to
relieve
her
and
day
and
night
nurses
were
in
constant
attendance
We
found
the
patient
sitting
up
in
her
bed
crying
one
minute
like
a
forlorn
child
and
again
screaming
in
fear
Matilla
Matilla
Then
suddenly
fighting
and
struggling
she
would
talk
a
wild
gibberish
of
English
and
Spanish
the
latter
a
language
of
which
she
had
no
knowledge
Mrs
Wickland
immediately
gave
her
psychic
diagnosis
saying
the
case
was
unquestionably
one
of
obsession
and
this
was
unexpectedly
confirmed
when
Mrs
Wickland
who
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
wraps
on
ready
to
leave
was
found
to
be
suddenly
entranced
We
placed
her
on
a
davenport
in
the
music
room
where
for
two
hours
I
talked
in
turn
with
several
spirits
who
had
just
been
attracted
from
the
patient
There
were
three
spirits
a
girl
named
Mary
her
suitor
an
American
and
his
Mexican
rival
Matilla
Both
of
the
men
had
vehemently
loved
the
girl
and
as
fiercely
hated
each
other
In
a
jealous
rage
one
had
killed
the
girl
and
then
in
a
desperate
fight
the
two
rivals
had
killed
each
other
All
were
unaware
of
being
dead
although
Mary
said
weeping
wretchedly
I
thought
they
were
going
to
kill
each
other
but
here
they
are
still
fighting
This
tragedy
of
love
hatred
and
jealousy
had
not
ended
with
physical
death
the
group
had
unconsciously
been
drawn
into
the
psychic
atmosphere
of
the
patient
and
the
violent
fighting
had
continued
within
her
aura
Since
her
nervous
resistance
was
exceedingly
low
at
this
time
one
after
the
other
had
usurped
her
physical
body
with
a
resulting
disturbance
that
was
unexplainable
by
her
attendants
With
great
difficulty
the
three
spirits
were
convinced
that
they
had
lost
their
physical
bodies
but
at
last
they
recognized
the
truth
and
were
taken
away
by
our
invisible
co
workers
Meanwhile
the
patient
had
arisen
and
speaking
rationally
to
the
astonished
nurse
walked
quietly
about
her
room
Presently
she
said
I
am
going
to
sleep
well
tonight
and
returning
to
bed
fell
asleep
without
the
usual
sedatives
and
rested
quietly
throughout
the
night
The
following
day
attended
by
a
nurse
she
was
brought
to
our
home
we
dismissed
the
nurse
discarded
her
medicines
and
after
an
electrical
treatment
the
patient
had
her
dinner
in
the
general
dining
room
with
the
other
patients
and
that
evening
attended
a
function
given
in
our
social
hall
Another
spirit
was
removed
from
her
the
next
day
this
was
a
little
girl
who
had
been
killed
in
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
and
who
cried
constantly
saying
she
was
lost
in
the
dark
It
is
needless
to
add
that
she
was
comforted
and
promptly
cared
for
by
spirit
friends
who
had
been
unable
to
reach
her
while
she
was
enmeshed
in
the
aura
of
a
psychic
sensitive
After
some
months
of
treatment
rest
and
recuperation
the
patient
returned
to
her
home
and
resumed
her
normal
life
again
One
of
our
early
experiences
in
Chicago
occurred
on
the
of
November
During
one
of
our
psychic
circles
Mrs
Wickland
entranced
by
a
strange
entity
fell
prostrate
to
the
floor
and
remained
in
a
comatose
condition
for
some
time
The
spirit
was
at
last
brought
to
the
front
and
acted
as
though
in
great
pain
repeatedly
saying
Why
didn
t
I
take
more
carbolic
acid
I
want
to
die
I
m
so
tired
of
living
In
a
weak
voice
the
spirit
complained
of
the
dense
darkness
all
about
and
was
unable
to
see
an
electric
light
shining
directly
into
her
face
She
whispered
faintly
My
poor
son
and
when
pressed
for
information
said
that
her
name
was
Mary
Rose
and
that
she
lived
at
South
Green
Street
a
street
entirely
unknown
to
us
at
that
time
At
first
she
could
not
remember
any
date
but
when
asked
Is
it
November
she
replied
No
that
is
next
week
Life
had
been
a
bitter
disappointment
to
her
she
had
suffered
constantly
from
chronic
abdominal
ailments
and
finally
resolving
to
end
her
miserable
existence
she
had
taken
poison
She
could
not
at
first
realize
that
she
had
succeeded
in
destroying
her
physical
body
for
like
most
suicides
she
was
in
total
ignorance
of
the
indestructibility
of
life
and
the
reality
of
the
hereafter
When
the
real
purpose
of
life
experience
and
suffering
had
been
made
clearer
to
her
she
was
overcome
with
repentance
and
offered
a
sincere
prayer
for
forgiveness
Then
her
spiritual
sight
opened
slightly
and
she
saw
dimly
the
spirit
figure
of
her
grandmother
who
had
come
to
take
her
to
the
spirit
world
Subsequent
inquiry
at
the
address
given
by
the
spirit
proved
her
statements
to
be
true
a
woman
by
the
name
given
had
lived
at
this
house
she
still
had
a
son
living
there
and
we
were
told
that
Mrs
Rose
had
been
taken
to
the
Cook
County
Hospital
and
had
died
there
the
week
before
Upon
investigation
at
the
hospital
we
found
further
verification
of
the
facts
and
were
given
a
copy
of
the
record
of
the
case

Another
case
will
show
that
identification
of
a
spirit
is
often
possible
Mrs
Fl
a
patient
who
had
been
declared
incurably
insane
by
several
physicians
was
a
refined
lady
of
gentle
disposition
who
had
become
very
wild
and
unmanageable
swearing
constantly
and
fighting
with
such
violence
that
several
persons
were
required
to
restrain
her
She
was
also
subject
to
coma
states
again
to
fainting
spells
would
refuse
food
announce
that
she
had
been
married
above
by
celestial
powers
and
used
extraordinarily
vile
language
these
various
phases
alternated
constantly
but
no
full
proof
of
obsession
was
evidenced
until
one
day
when
Mrs
Fl
lost
all
power
of
speech
and
mumbling
idiotically
simulated
perfectly
a
deaf
and
dumb
person
At
this
time
a
gentleman
from
an
adjoining
state
came
to
the
house
to
visit
a
patient
and
shortly
after
his
arrival
the
nurse
who
attended
Mrs
Fl
reported
that
the
patient
had
again
changed
and
was
talking
like
a
little
child
So
striking
was
this
alteration
that
the
gentleman
was
asked
to
step
into
the
room
to
observe
the
patient
He
was
a
total
stranger
to
her
but
as
he
entered
the
room
she
pointed
to
him
and
said
in
a
high
childish
voice
I
know
that
man
He
used
to
put
bows
on
my
shoulders
Arid
he
pulled
my
toofies
He
took
me
to
a
gypsy
camp
too
He
lived
right
across
the
street
from
me
and
he
used
to
call
me
Rosebud
I
m
four
years
old
The
astonished
gentleman
corroborated
every
statement
saying
that
he
had
known
such
a
child
in
his
home
town
in
Iowa
but
that
she
had
died
the
year
before
He
explained
that
he
was
very
fond
of
children
and
had
on
several
occasions
taken
the
child
to
a
gypsy
camp
and
that
whenever
he
bought
taffy
on
a
stick
for
the
little
girl
he
would
tug
at
the
stick
while
she
was
eating
the
candy
and
playfully
threaten
to
pull
her
teeth
It
was
evident
that
affection
had
attracted
the
spirit
child
to
her
friend
and
that
she
found
in
Mrs
Fl
a
vehicle
through
which
she
could
make
her
presence
known
to
the
gentleman
The
patient
was
relieved
of
this
spirit
and
gradually
of
other
obsessing
influences
and
several
months
later
was
pronounced
entirely
competent
to
sign
legal
papers
being
declared
normal
and
sane
by
a
judge
and
jury
Another
case
in
point
was
that
of
Mrs
who
was
a
cook
in
a
restaurant
She
had
observed
a
waitress
acting
queerly
laboring
under
delusions
and
hallucinations
and
brought
her
to
my
office
After
an
electrical
treatment
the
patient
declared
she
felt
greatly
relieved
and
returned
to
her
home
But
that
night
Mrs
herself
became
disturbed
by
an
unaccountable
condition
which
prevented
her
from
sleeping
and
her
restlessness
continued
until
ten
o
clock
the
following
morning
when
in
the
midst
of
her
preparations
for
dinner
she
suddenly
became
wild
tore
her
hair
and
threatened
to
harm
herself
I
was
sent
for
and
arriving
found
Mrs
raving
in
a
demented
condition
complaining
of
being
chased
here
and
there
and
being
unable
to
find
a
resting
place
Suspecting
the
presence
of
an
invisible
entity
I
placed
Mrs
in
a
chair
pinioned
her
arms
to
prevent
a
struggle
and
after
several
remarks
the
entity
declared
it
was
a
man
but
denied
being
dead
or
obsessing
a
woman
The
spirit
said
his
name
was
Jack
that
he
was
an
uncle
of
the
troubled
waitress
and
that
he
had
been
a
vagabond
in
life
After
reasoning
with
the
intelligence
he
began
to
realize
his
situation
and
promising
to
cause
no
further
annoyance
left
Mrs
then
immediately
became
her
normal
self
and
returned
to
her
work
without
any
further
disturbance
It
was
later
ascertained
from
the
waitress
that
she
had
bad
an
uncle
named
Jack
who
had
been
a
vagabond
and
that
he
was
dead
In
this
experience
Mrs
had
acted
as
the
psychic
intermediary
to
whom
the
spirit
obsessing
the
waitress
had
been
transferred
A
number
of
years
ago
Dr
Lydston
wrote
in
the
Chicago
papers
of
a
patient
who
although
having
no
knowledge
of
French
or
music
sang
well
the
Marseillaise
in
French
when
placed
under
the
influence
of
an
anesthetic
Dr
Lydston
denying
the
continued
existence
of
the
ego
explained
this
phenomenon
as
one
of
subliminal
consciousness
or
unconscious
memory
comnparing
it
with
the
case
of
the
uneducated
domestic
who
in
delirium
recited
classic
Latin
as
perfectly
as
her
former
employer
a
Professor
of
Latin
had
done
during
his
life
I
replied
in
a
newspaper
article
that
such
phenomena
were
frequently
met
with
in
psychic
research
and
stated
that
despite
the
classification
of
materialistic
scientists
these
cases
clearly
proved
the
posthumous
existence
of
spirits
and
their
ability
to
communicate
through
mortals
I
added
that
if
the
truth
were
known
about
these
two
cases
we
would
find
that
the
man
who
sang
French
was
a
psychic
sensitive
and
had
at
the
time
been
controlled
by
some
outside
intelligence
while
in
all
probability
the
domestic
who
recited
Latin
was
obsessed
by
the
spirit
of
the
former
professor
Shortly
after
this
the
gentleman
alluded
to
by
Dr
Lydston
called
on
me
having
read
my
article
and
said
I
don
t
know
anything
about
French
but
I
do
know
that
I
am
bothered
to
death
by
spirits
In
the
study
of
cases
of
Multiple
Personalities
Dissociated
Personalities
or
Disintegrated
States
of
Consciousness
modern
psychologists
disclaim
the
possibility
of
foreign
intelligences
on
the
ground
that
these
personalities
give
neither
evidence
of
supernormal
knowledge
nor
of
being
of
spiritistic
origin
Our
experience
to
the
contrary
has
proven
that
the
majority
of
these
intelligences
are
oblivious
of
their
transition
and
hence
it
does
not
enter
their
minds
that
they
are
spirits
and
they
are
loath
to
recognize
the
fact
In
the
case
of
Miss
Beauchamp
as
recorded
by
Dr
Morton
Prince
in
The
Dissociation
of
a
Personality
reporting
four
alternating
personalities
no
claim
was
made
that
any
outside
intelligences
were
responsible
for
the
various
personalities
and
yet
Sally
personality
insisted
that
she
herself
was
not
the
same
as
Miss
Beauchamp
Christine
that
her
own
consciousness
was
distinct
from
that
of
Miss
Beauchamp
and
told
of
Miss
Beauchamp
s
learning
to
walk
and
talk
When
she
was
a
very
little
girl
just
learning
to
walk
I
remember
her
thoughts
distinctly
as
separate
from
mine
Similarly
in
the
case
of
Bernice
Redick
of
Ohio
the
young
school
girl
who
constantly
changed
from
her
normal
self
to
the
personality
of
Polly
an
unruly
child
every
indication
is
given
of
the
influence
of
a
discarnate
spirit
probably
ignorant
of
being
dead
controlling
Miss
Redick
That
such
personalities
are
independent
entities
could
easily
be
proven
under
proper
conditions
by
transference
of
the
same
to
a
psychic
intermediary
as
similar
experiments
have
so
abundantly
demonstrated
Any
attempt
to
explain
our
experiences
on
the
theory
of
the
Subconscious
Mind
and
Auto
Suggestion
or
Multiple
Personalities
would
be
untenable
since
it
is
manifestly
impossible
that
Mrs
Wickland
should
have
a
thousand
personalities
and
since
it
is
so
readily
possible
to
cause
transference
of
psychosis
from
a
supposedly
insane
person
to
Mrs
Wickland
relieving
the
victim
and
in
this
way
discovering
that
the
disturbance
was
due
to
a
discarnate
entity
whose
identity
can
often
be
verified
Individuals
who
are
clairaudient
suffer
greatly
from
the
constant
annoyance
of
hearing
the
voices
of
obsessing
entities
the
auditory
hallucinations
frequently
observed
by
alienists
and
when
such
a
person
is
present
in
a
psychic
circle
where
the
spirits
are
dislodged
and
transferred
to
the
psychic
intermediary
interesting
developments
occur
An
illustration
is
the
case
of
Mrs
Burton
a
clairaudient
patient
who
was
constantly
combatting
obsessing
spirits
and
who
while
attending
our
circle
was
relieved
of
her
unwelcome
companions
In
the
following
records
the
conversation
of
the
spirits
through
the
psychic
Mrs
Wickland
will
elucidate
the
characteristics
of
the
several
entities
Spirit
CARRIE
HUNTINGTON
Patient
MRS
BURTON
Doctor
Tell
us
who
you
are
Spirit
I
do
not
wish
you
to
hold
my
hands
Dr
You
must
sit
still
Sp
Why
do
you
treat
me
like
this
Dr
Who
are
you
Sp
Why
do
you
want
to
know
Dr
You
have
come
here
as
a
stranger
and
we
would
like
to
know
who
you
are
Sp
What
are
you
so
interested
for
Dr
We
should
like
to
know
with
whom
we
are
associating
If
a
stranger
came
to
your
home
would
you
not
like
to
know
his
name
Sp
I
do
not
want
to
be
here
and
I
do
not
know
any
of
you
Somebody
pushed
me
in
here
and
I
do
not
think
it
is
right
to
force
me
in
like
that
And
when
I
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
chair
you
grabbed
my
hands
as
if
I
were
a
prisoner
Why
was
I
pushed
in
here
Brought
in
control
of
psychic
by
guiding
intelligences
Dr
You
were
probably
in
the
dark
Sp
It
seems
somebody
took
me
by
force
Dr
Was
there
any
reason
for
it
Sp
I
do
not
know
of
any
reason
and
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
be
bothered
like
that
Dr
Was
no
reason
given
for
handling
you
in
this
manner
sp
It
has
been
a
terrible
time
for
me
for
quite
a
while
I
have
been
tormented
to
death
I
have
been
driven
here
there
and
everywhere
I
am
getting
so
provoked
about
it
that
I
feel
like
giving
everything
a
good
shaking
Dr
What
have
they
done
to
you
Sp
It
seems
so
terrible
If
I
walk
around
I
am
so
very
miserable
I
do
not
know
what
it
is
Sometimes
it
seems
as
if
my
senses
were
being
knocked
out
of
me
Something
comes
on
me
like
thunder
and
lightning
Static
treatment
of
patient
it
makes
such
a
noise
This
terrible
noise
it
is
awful
I
cannot
stand
it
any
more
and
I
will
not
either
Dr
We
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
not
stand
it
any
more
Sp
Am
I
not
welcome
And
if
I
am
not
I
do
not
care
Dr
You
are
not
very
particular
Sp
I
have
had
so
much
hardship
Dr
How
long
have
you
been
dead
Sp
Why
do
you
speak
that
way
I
am
not
dead
I
am
as
alive
as
I
can
be
and
I
feel
as
if
I
were
young
again
Dr
Have
you
not
felt
at
times
as
if
you
were
somebody
else
Sp
At
times
I
feel
very
strange
especially
when
it
knocks
me
me
senseless
I
feel
very
bad
I
do
not
feel
that
I
should
have
this
suffering
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
have
such
things
Dr
Probably
it
is
necessary
Sp
I
feel
I
should
be
free
to
go
where
I
please
but
it
seems
I
have
no
will
of
my
own
any
more
I
try
but
it
seems
somebody
else
takes
possession
of
me
and
gets
me
into
some
place
where
they
knock
me
nearly
senseless
If
I
knew
it
I
never
would
go
there
but
there
is
a
person
who
seems
to
have
the
right
to
take
me
everywhere
but
I
feel
I
should
have
the
right
to
take
her
Referring
to
patient
Dr
What
business
have
you
with
her
Can
t
you
live
your
own
life
SP
I
live
my
own
life
but
she
interferes
with
me
I
talk
to
her
She
wants
to
chase
me
out
I
feel
like
chasing
her
out
and
that
is
a
real
struggle
I
cannot
see
why
I
should
not
have
the
right
just
as
well
as
she
has
Dr
Probably
you
are
interfering
with
her
SP
She
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
I
am
not
bothering
her
I
only
talk
to
her
sometimes
Dr
Does
she
know
you
talk
to
her
Sp
Sometimes
she
does
and
then
she
chases
me
right
out
She
acts
all
right
but
she
gets
so
provoked
Then
when
she
gets
into
that
place
I
am
knocked
senseless
and
I
feel
terrible
I
have
no
power
to
take
her
away
She
makes
me
get
out
Dr
You
should
not
stay
around
her
Sp
It
is
my
body
it
is
not
hers
She
has
no
right
there
I
do
not
see
why
she
interferes
with
me
Dr
She
interferes
with
your
selfishness
Sp
I
feel
I
have
some
right
in
life
I
think
so
Dr
You
passed
out
of
your
body
without
understanding
the
fact
and
have
been
bothering
a
lady
You
should
go
to
the
spirit
world
and
not
hover
around
here
Sp
You
say
I
am
hovering
around
I
am
not
hovering
around
and
I
am
not
one
to
interfere
but
I
want
a
little
to
say
about
things
Dr
That
was
why
you
had
the
thunder
and
the
knocks
Sp
That
was
all
right
for
a
while
but
lately
it
is
terrible
I
must
have
understanding
Dr
You
will
have
it
now
Sp
I
will
do
anything
to
stop
that
terrible
knocking
Mrs
B
Recognizing
the
spirit
as
one
who
had
been
troubling
her
I
am
mighty
tired
of
you
Who
are
you
anyway
Sp
I
am
a
stranger
Mrs
B
What
is
your
name
Sp
My
name
Mrs
B
Have
you
one
Sp
My
name
is
Carrie
Mrs
B
Carrie
what
Sp
Carrie
Huntington
Mrs
B
Where
do
you
live
Sp
San
Antonio
Texas
Mrs
B
You
have
been
with
me
a
long
time
haven
t
you
It
had
been
a
number
of
years
since
Mrs
B
had
been
in
San
Antonio
Sp
You
have
been
with
me
a
long
time
I
should
like
to
find
out
why
you
interfere
with
me
I
recognize
you
now
Mrs
B
What
street
did
you
live
on
Sp
I
lived
in
many
different
plates
there
Dr
Do
you
realize
the
fact
that
you
have
lost
your
own
mortal
body
Can
you
remember
having
been
sick
Sp
The
last
I
remember
I
was
in
El
Paso
I
do
not
remember
anything
after
that
I
went
there
and
I
do
not
seem
to
remember
when
I
left
It
seems
that
I
should
be
there
now
I
got
very
sick
one
day
there
Dr
Probably
you
lost
your
body
then
Sp
After
El
Paso
I
do
not
know
where
I
went
I
went
some
distance
I
traveled
on
the
railroad
and
it
was
just
like
I
was
nobody
Nobody
asked
me
anything
and
I
had
to
follow
that
lady
Mrs
B
as
if
I
were
her
servant
and
I
feel
very
annoyed
about
it
Mrs
B
You
worried
me
to
death
because
you
sang
all
the
time
Sp
I
had
to
do
something
to
attract
your
attention
because
you
would
not
listen
to
me
any
other
way
You
traveled
on
the
train
and
it
took
me
away
from
my
home
and
folks
and
I
feel
very
much
hurt
about
it
Do
you
understand
Mrs
B
I
understand
you
far
better
than
you
do
me
Dr
Can
t
you
realize
what
has
been
the
matter
with
you
Sp
I
want
to
tell
you
that
I
do
not
want
those
knockings
any
more
I
will
stay
away
Dr
Understand
your
condition
understand
that
you
are
an
ignorant
obessing
spirit
and
that
you
have
no
physical
body
You
died
probably
at
the
time
you
were
sick
Sp
Could
you
talk
to
a
ghost
Dr
Such
things
certainly
do
happen
Sp
I
am
not
a
ghost
because
ghosts
cannot
talk
When
you
are
dead
you
lie
there
Dr
When
the
body
dies
it
lies
there
But
the
spirit
does
not
Sp
That
goes
to
God
who
gave
it
Dr
Where
is
He
Where
is
that
God
Sp
In
Heaven
Dr
Where
is
that
Sp
It
is
where
you
go
to
find
Jesus
Dr
The
Bible
says
God
is
Love
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
Love
dwelleth
in
God
Where
will
you
find
that
God
Sp
I
suppose
in
Heaven
I
cannot
tell
you
anything
about
it
But
I
know
I
have
been
in
the
worst
hell
you
could
give
me
with
those
knockings
I
do
not
see
that
they
have
done
me
any
good
I
do
not
like
them
at
all
Dr
Then
you
must
stay
away
from
that
lady
SP
I
see
her
well
now
and
I
can
have
a
real
conversation
with
her
Dr
Yes
but
this
will
be
the
last
time
SP
How
do
you
know
it
will
Dr
When
you
leave
here
you
will
understand
that
you
have
been
talking
through
another
person
s
body
That
person
is
my
wife
Sp
What
nonsense
I
thought
you
looked
wiser
than
to
talk
such
nonsense
Dr
It
may
seem
foolish
but
look
at
your
hands
Do
you
recognize
them
Sp
They
do
not
look
like
mine
but
so
much
has
taken
place
lately
that
I
do
not
know
what
I
shall
do
That
lady
over
there
Mrs
B
has
been
acting
like
a
madman
and
I
have
taken
it
as
it
came
so
I
shall
have
to
find
out
what
she
thinks
of
doing
and
why
she
does
those
things
to
me
Dr
She
will
be
very
happy
to
be
rid
of
you
Mrs
B
Carrie
how
old
are
you
Sp
You
know
that
a
lady
never
wants
to
tell
her
age
Dr
Especially
if
she
happens
to
be
a
spinster
Sp
Please
excuse
me
you
will
have
to
take
it
as
it
is
I
will
not
tell
my
age
to
any
one
Dr
Have
you
ever
been
married
Sp
Yes
I
was
married
to
a
fellow
but
I
did
not
care
for
him
Dr
What
was
his
name
Sp
That
is
a
secret
with
me
I
would
not
have
his
name
mentioned
for
anything
and
I
do
not
want
to
carry
his
name
either
My
name
is
Carrie
Huntington
because
it
was
my
name
and
I
do
not
want
to
carry
his
name
Dr
Do
you
want
to
go
to
the
spirit
world
Sp
What
foolish
questions
you
put
to
me
Dr
It
may
seem
foolish
to
you
but
nevertheless
there
is
a
spirit
world
Spiritual
things
often
seem
foolish
to
the
mortal
mind
You
have
lost
your
body
Sp
I
have
not
lost
my
body
I
have
been
with
this
lady
but
she
does
one
thing
I
do
not
like
very
well
She
eats
too
much
She
eats
too
much
and
gets
too
strong
then
I
have
no
power
over
her
body
not
as
much
as
I
want
to
To
Mrs
B
I
want
you
to
eat
less
I
try
very
much
to
dictate
to
you
not
to
eat
that
and
that
but
you
have
no
sense
You
do
not
even
listen
to
me
Mrs
B
This
is
the
place
I
told
you
to
go
to
but
you
would
not
go
by
yourself
Sp
I
know
it
But
you
have
no
business
to
take
me
where
I
get
those
knockings
I
do
not
want
to
stay
with
you
if
you
take
those
awful
knockings
Dr
They
are
in
the
next
room
Do
you
want
some
Sp
No
thank
you
Not
for
me
any
more
Dr
Listen
to
what
is
told
you
then
you
will
not
need
any
more
You
are
an
ignorant
spirit
I
mean
you
are
ignorant
of
your
condition
You
lost
your
body
evidently
without
knowing
it
Sp
How
do
you
know
Dr
You
are
now
controlling
my
wife
s
body
Sp
I
never
saw
you
before
so
how
in
the
world
can
you
think
I
should
be
called
your
wife
No
never
Dr
I
do
not
want
you
to
be
Sp
I
don
t
want
you
either
Dr
I
don
t
want
you
to
control
my
wife
s
body
much
longer
you
must
realize
that
you
have
lost
your
physical
body
Do
you
recognize
these
hands
Mrs
Wickland
s
hands
Sp
I
have
changed
so
much
lately
that
all
those
changes
make
me
crazy
It
makes
me
tired
Dr
Now
Carrie
be
sensible
Sp
I
am
sensible
and
don
t
you
tell
me
differently
else
you
will
have
some
one
to
tell
you
something
you
never
heard
before
Dr
Now
Carrie
Sp
I
am
Mrs
Carrie
Huntington
Mrs
B
You
listen
to
what
the
Doctor
has
to
say
to
you
Sp
I
will
not
listen
to
any
one
I
tell
you
once
for
all
I
have
been
from
one
to
another
and
I
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
me
Dr
Do
you
know
you
are
talking
through
my
wife
s
body
Sp
Such
nonsense
I
think
that
s
the
craziest
thing
I
ever
heard
in
my
life
Dr
Now
you
will
have
to
be
sensible
Sp
Sensible
I
am
sensible
Are
you
a
perfect
man
Dr
No
I
am
not
but
I
tell
you
that
you
are
an
ignorant
selfish
spirit
You
have
been
bothering
that
lady
for
some
time
and
we
have
chased
you
out
by
the
use
of
those
knocks
Whether
you
understand
it
or
not
you
are
an
ignorant
spirit
You
will
have
to
behave
yourself
or
else
I
will
take
you
into
the
office
and
give
you
some
more
of
those
knocks
SP
I
don
t
want
those
knocks
Dr
Then
change
your
disposition
Realize
that
there
is
no
death
when
people
lose
their
bodies
they
merely
become
invisible
to
mortals
You
are
invisible
to
us
SP
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
Dr
We
want
to
help
you
and
make
you
understand
your
condition
Sp
I
don
t
need
help
Dr
If
you
don
t
behave
you
will
be
taken
away
by
intelligent
spirits
and
placed
in
a
dungeon
Sp
You
think
you
can
scare
me
You
will
find
out
what
will
happen
to
you
Dr
You
must
overcome
your
selfish
disposition
Look
around
you
may
see
some
one
who
will
make
you
care
You
may
see
some
one
who
will
make
you
cry
Sp
I
don
t
want
to
cry
I
like
to
sing
instead
of
cry
Dr
Where
is
your
mother
Sp
I
haven
t
seen
her
for
a
long
time
My
mother
My
mother
She
is
in
Heaven
She
was
a
good
woman
and
is
with
God
and
the
Holy
Ghost
and
all
of
them
Dr
Look
around
and
see
if
your
mother
is
not
here
Sp
This
place
is
not
Heaven
far
from
it
If
this
is
heaven
then
it
is
worse
than
hell
Dr
Look
for
your
mother
she
will
put
you
to
shame
Sp
I
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
What
business
have
you
to
give
me
those
knocks
and
have
me
put
in
a
dungeon
That
lady
and
I
made
a
bargain
Dr
She
made
a
bargain
to
come
here
and
get
rid
of
you
You
have
been
fired
out
by
electricity
You
have
lost
your
company
Sp
Yes
for
a
while
they
all
left
me
I
can
t
find
them
Other
obsessing
spirits
Why
did
you
chase
that
tall
fellow
away
Dr
This
lady
wants
her
body
herself
she
does
not
want
to
be
tormented
by
earthbound
spirits
Would
you
like
them
around
you
Sp
I
don
t
know
what
you
mean
Dr
Can
t
you
realize
that
you
bothered
that
lady
and
made
her
life
a
perfect
hell
Sp
To
Mrs
B
I
have
not
bothered
you
Mrs
B
You
woke
me
up
at
three
o
clock
this
morning
Sp
Well
you
have
no
business
to
sleep
Dr
You
must
live
your
own
life
Sp
I
will
Dr
That
will
be
in
a
dark
dungeon
if
you
do
not
behave
yourself
Sp
How
do
you
know
Dr
You
cannot
stay
here
You
had
better
be
humble
and
ask
for
help
that
is
what
you
need
My
wife
and
I
have
been
following
this
work
for
many
years
and
she
allows
all
sorts
of
spirits
to
use
her
body
so
they
may
be
helped
Sp
Sarcastically
She
is
very
good
Dr
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
Do
you
see
your
mother
SP
I
don
t
want
to
see
her
I
don
t
want
to
call
her
away
from
Heaven
Dr
Since
Heaven
is
a
condition
of
happiness
she
could
not
be
in
any
Heaven
with
a
daughter
like
you
she
could
not
be
happy
Suppose
you
were
in
Heaven
and
had
a
daughter
would
you
like
her
to
act
as
you
do
Sp
I
do
not
act
contrary
What
is
the
situation
Tell
me
that
Dr
I
have
already
told
you
the
situation
You
are
controlling
my
wife
s
body
Sp
How
do
I
do
that
Dr
Because
of
higher
laws
and
because
you
are
a
spirit
Spirit
and
mind
are
invisible
You
are
so
selfish
that
you
do
not
care
to
understand
Sp
This
is
not
Heaven
Dr
This
is
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
For
God
s
sake
no
An
expression
never
used
by
Mrs
Wickland
How
did
I
come
here
Dr
By
staying
around
that
lady
That
is
how
She
had
to
take
those
knocks
to
get
you
out
Sp
She
s
a
fool
to
do
it
Dr
She
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
and
she
will
get
rid
of
you
Sp
I
will
not
have
those
knocks
any
more
Dr
Higher
spirits
will
show
you
something
you
do
not
like
if
you
do
not
behave
yourself
Sp
Shrinking
from
some
vision
I
don
t
want
that
Dr
It
is
not
what
you
want
it
is
what
you
get
Sp
Is
that
so
As
nothing
could
be
done
to
bring
the
spirit
to
an
understanding
she
was
taken
away
by
intelligent
spirits
Upon
a
later
occasion
when
the
patient
Mrs
Burton
was
in
the
circle
another
spirit
was
removed
from
her
and
controlling
Mrs
Wickland
spoke
in
a
very
individualistic
manner

JIMMIE
HUNTINGTON
Patient
MRS
BURTON
The
spirit
kicked
off
both
shoes
and
seemed
greatly
disturbed
Dr
What
seems
to
be
the
trouble
Have
you
been
in
an
accident
of
some
kind
Holding
psychic
s
hands
firmly
You
have
no
shoes
on
SP
I
took
them
off
Dr
Tell
us
who
you
are
Sp
I
don
t
know
whether
I
want
to
Dr
Tell
us
where
you
came
from
Sp
I
don
t
know
that
I
have
to
do
that
Dr
We
would
like
to
know
who
you
are
What
seems
to
be
the
trouble
You
don
t
seem
to
be
comfortable
Sp
I
am
not
Dr
What
have
you
been
doing
lately
Sp
I
haven
t
been
doing
anything
I
have
just
been
walking
around
Dr
And
what
else
Sp
Why
nothing
in
particular
It
seems
that
I
have
been
shut
up
somewhere
In
patient
s
aura
Dr
In
what
way
Sp
I
don
t
know
how
it
is
but
I
couldn
t
get
out
Dr
How
would
you
explain
that
Sp
I
can
t
explain
it
in
any
way
Dr
Did
you
hear
any
talking
Sp
Yes
many
people
talked
Dr
What
did
they
say
Sp
One
said
one
thing
one
another
They
all
think
they
are
so
smart
Dr
Did
you
ever
have
any
chance
to
say
anything
Sp
Yes
but
I
got
so
mad
because
there
was
always
a
woman
there
she
knew
all
I
wanted
to
say
I
felt
that
some
times
I
should
have
a
chance
Whenever
they
talked
that
woman
talked
A
man
has
no
chance
to
say
anything
when
a
woman
begins
to
talk
Dr
You
must
have
been
a
married
man
Sp
Why
yes
I
am
married
Dr
Was
it
a
success
or
a
failure
Sp
I
don
t
know
what
it
was
an
excuse
anyway
I
was
not
so
very
happy
Women
always
talk
too
much
They
can
t
leave
a
fellow
alone
a
minute
at
a
time
Dr
What
did
they
talk
about
Sp
It
s
that
woman
she
talks
and
talks
and
talks
Patient
Mrs
Burton
who
talked
constantly
She
never
can
keep
still
very
long
at
a
time
I
felt
sometimes
like
shaking
her
good
We
just
had
some
new
company
come
in
They
talk
and
talk
It
makes
me
sick
they
make
me
get
out
They
are
the
worst
I
ever
saw
Dr
Did
anything
happen
at
all
Sp
Lightning
played
around
my
head
until
I
didn
t
know
where
I
was
Electrical
treatment
given
patient
I
thought
it
was
far
distant
but
my
God
and
Stars
in
Heaven
how
it
hit
me
Dr
What
did
you
want
to
do
at
such
times
Sp
I
wanted
to
get
hold
of
that
lightning
and
try
to
stop
it
hitting
my
head
but
the
lightning
strikes
every
time
it
never
misses
Lightning
used
to
be
different
it
didn
t
always
strike
but
now
it
never
misses
I
never
saw
anything
like
it
There
are
stars
before
your
eyes
and
it
feels
terrible
but
even
while
the
lightning
strikes
that
woman
keeps
right
on
talking
Patient
talked
throughout
treatment
Dr
What
does
she
talk
about
Sp
Nothing
She
wants
to
be
boss
and
I
want
to
be
boss
so
there
we
are
Dr
What
does
she
say
Sp
You
know
how
it
is
with
women
they
talk
and
talk
but
there
is
never
anything
to
it
Dr
Does
the
lady
address
you
Sp
She
torments
me
all
the
time
I
feel
like
shaking
her
but
I
don
t
seem
to
have
any
power
any
more
Then
there
is
another
woman
and
she
goes
right
at
it
too
It
makes
me
sick
What
can
you
do
with
a
woman
to
make
her
stop
talking
If
you
can
get
any
woman
to
stop
talking
you
ll
have
a
pretty
hard
time
to
do
it
Dr
What
is
your
name

It
s
a
long
time
since
I
heard

Dr
Where

Are

I
don

know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
That
lightning
gets
on
my
knees
and
feet
then
from
my
head
to
my
feet
but
what
I
can
t
understand
is
it
never
misses
its
aim
Dr
How
old
are
you
Sp
I
will
say
that
I
am
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
but
I
want
to
say
that
during
all
my
life
I
never
saw
such
lightning
before
and
what
I
can
t
understand
is
that
nothing
ever
catches
fire
from
it
Gosh
Yesterday
I
got
into
a
regular
nest
it
was
the
worst
I
ever
saw
in
my
whole

think
every
one
was
a
devil
Obsessing

There

another
one
standing

Dr
How

In

Of

Nothing

nonsense
She
makes

Nothing

Taking

Say
it

looks

like
she
was
sick
Another

obsessing
patient
She
doesn
t
say
much
but
I
suppose
she
is
so
annoyed
because
that
other
woman
talks
so
awful
Please
don
t
hold
my
hand
I
like
to
feel
free
If
I
were
alone

I
could
hold
her
hand
that

be
a
different

Aren
t
you
satisfied

both

her
funeral
Dr
You
were
at
the
funeral
of
her
body
not
her
spirit
soul
or
mind
Sp
I
suppose
she
went
to
Heaven
Dr
Look
around
and
see
if
you
can
see
her
Sp
Where
Dr
She
might
be
here
Sp
What
place
is
this
anyhow
If
I
am
your
wife
I
have
never
seen
you
before
Dr
You
are
not
my
wife
Sp
You
called
me
your
wife
Dr
I
did
not
say
you
are
my
wife
You
are
temporarily
using
her
body
Sp
For
God
s
sake
in
Heaven
and
hell
how
can
I
get
out
of
your
wife
Dr
Be
sensible
What
do
those
imps
say
Sp
They
say
they
are
going
to
stay
but
I
say
and
say
it
strong
that
they
are
all
going
to
go
Dr
Do
you
want
them
to
go
with
you
Sp
I
should
say
I
do
Dr
You
can
help
them
a
great
deal
by
reforming
them
and
making
them
understand
their
condition
They
need
help
You
are
all
ignorant
spirits
and
have
been
bothering
that
lady
I
am
the
one
who
gave
you
lightning
and
chased
you
out
You
can
all
to
the
spirit
world
and
learn
how
to
progress
Sp
Is
that
woman
going
too
There
is
a
whole
lot
a
gang
but
I
haven
t
seen
any
of
them
until
lately
Dr
Can
you
see
anybody
you
know
Just
sit
quietly
for
a
moment
and
look
around
Sp
Excitedly
Why
here
comes
Nora
A
spirit
Dr
Who
is
Nora
Sp
Nora
Huntington
she
s
my
sister
Dr
Ask
her
if
your
name
is
Jimmie
Huntington
Sp
She
says
it
is
and
that
she
hasn
t
seen
me
for
such
a
long
time
Suddenly
puzzled
But
she
s
dead
Dr
Let
her
explain
the
situation
Sp
She
says
Jimmie
you
come
home
with
me
Where
shall
I
come
Dr
What
does
she
say
Sp
She
says
To
the
spirit
world
but
I
don
t
believe
her
Dr
Was
your
sister
in
the
habit
of
lying
to
you
Sp
No
Dr
If
she
were
honest
before
would
she
lie
now
Sp
She
says
she
has
been
hunting
for
me
for
years
and
she
didn
t
know
where
I
was
Dr
Where
has
she
been
Sp
Why
she
s
dead
I
was
at
her
funeral
and
I
know
well
that
she
was
not
buried
alive
Dr
You
went
to
the
funeral
of
her
body
not
her
spirit
Sp
This
is
her
ghost
then
Dr
She
is
probably
an
intelligent
spirit
We
do
not
need
to
argue
about
that
any
more
Let
her
explain
Sp
She
says
Let
us
go
Jimmie
and
take
the
gang
with
us
She
says
she
is
a
missionary
and
helps
everybody
she
can
she
says
she
helps
unfortunates
I
have
been
unfortunate
too
Dr
Tell
this
lady
this
other
spirit
you
have
been
talking
about
to
go
with
you
SP
She
says
if
she
leaves
she
has
no
body
Dr
Tell
her
she
has
a
spirit
body
She
doesn
t
need
a
physical
body
Tell
her
that
they
will
teach
her
how
to
progress
You
take
the
imps
along
too
Sp
I
can
t
carry
them
all
with
me
How
do
you
know
they
all
want
to
go
with
us
Dr
They
will
go
if
you
can
show
them
anything
better
than
they
have
now
Probably
they
never
had
any
chance
in
life
Sp
I
never
thought
of
that
Dr
We
cannot
blame
them
altogether
Show
them
the
better
way
and
they
will
follow
Sp
Where
am
I
now
Dr
In
California
Sp
Where
in
California
Dr
Los
Angeles
Sp
If
you
are
in
California
it
doesn
t
mean
that
I
am
there
too
Dr
How
could
you
be
anywhere
else
since
you
are
here
Sp
Of
course
that
is
reasonable
The
last
I
remember
I
was
in
Dallas
Texas
and
the
first
thing
I
knew
I
was
struck
on
the
back
of
my
head
I
was
shoeing
a
horse
when
I
was
struck
Did
he
kill
me
Dr
He
evidently
chased
you
out
of
your
body
Nobody
ever
dies
If
you
don
t
go
soon
your
sister
will
become
tired
of
waiting
for
you
Sp
I
ll
go
with
her
if
you
ll
let
me
but
I
ll
have
to
walk
Dr
How
are
you
going
to
walk
With
my
wife
s
body
You
will
have
to
learn
a
new
lesson
Just
think
yourself
with
your
sister
and
you
will
be
there
instantly
You
will
have
to
travel
by
thought
Sp
Stars
in
Heaven
that
s
a
new
wrinkle
Dr
Now
friend
you
can
t
stay
any
longer
Sp
That
s
a
nice
way
to
talk
to
me
Dr
I
don
t
want
you
to
use
my
wife
s
body
any
longer
Sp
What
body
will
I
get
hold
of
when
I
get
out
from
here
Dr
When
you
leave
this
body
you
will
have
your
spirit
body
That
is
invisible
to
us
Sp
Can
I
jump
from
this
body
into
a
spirit
body
Dr
Your
sister
will
explain
Just
think
yourself
with
your
sister
You
do
not
need
any
physical
body
for
that
purpose
Sp
I
am
commencing
to
get
sleepy
Dr
Go
with
your
sister
and
follow
her
instructions
you
will
learn
many
new
lessons
in
the
spirit
life
Take
all
the
gang
and
the
little
imps
with
you
Sp
To
spirits
Now
you
come
along
with
me
all
of
you

you
Dr
Will
they
all
go

you
Sp
Now

are
going
Come
on
the
whole
gang

you
Goodbye
On
a
subsequent

We
can
hear
you

we
can
only
hear
you
talk
through
a
woman

body
Sp
Now
you
re
kidding
me
You
think
that
I
I
would
ever
talk
through
a
woman
Not
much
I
would
not
go
across
the
street
to
talk
through
a

You
know
I

understand
what
this
thing
is
I
don

know
why
I
should
be
here
I
don
t
know
what
s
the
matter
all
of
you
are
sitting
around
looking
at

Why
are
there
people
standing
around
each
one
here
There
are
others
standing
around
looking
at
me
too
Could
they
have
conversation
with
a
fellow
Dr
If
I
explain
to
you
will
you
try
to
understand
In
the
first
place
you
are
dead
as
people
would
say
Sp
If
I
m
a
dead
one
that
s
a
good
thing
Dr
You
yourself
are
not
dead

But
you
said
I
was
dead
Dr
You
are
dead
to
your
own
people
and
friends
We
know
you
are
not
dead
in
reality
you
only
lost
your
physical
body

you
also
have
a
spirit
body
when
you
pass
out
of
your
mortal
body
You
find
yourself
alive
and
you
have
a
spirit
body
but
you
cannot
explain
it
Sp
I
know
I
have
been
walking
a
very
great
deal
and
it
seems
to
me
I
never
get
anywhere
I
saw
a
lot
of
people
here
I
came
here
with
the
crowd
and
before
I
knew
it
everything
was
light
and
I
saw
you
all
sitting
around
in
a
circle
singing
I
thought
it
was
a
prayer
meeting
so
I
stopped
and
before
I
knew
anything
I
could
talk
Before
then
I
thought
I
must
be
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
because
I
could
not
see
anything
and
I
am
so
tired
Dr
Most
of
those
you
see
here
are
spirits
like
yourself
Sp
Why
are
we
here
Dr
Many
have
been
brought
to
obtain
understanding
You
yourself
are
controlling
my
wife
s
body
You
are
not
my
wife
but
you
are
using
my
wife
s
body
It
does
not
make
any
difference
how
strange
it
seems
to
you
it
is
a
fact
You
are
invisible
to
us
and
you
are
speaking
through
my
wife
s
organism
That
man
you
speak
of
is
a
spirit
too
Take
him
with
you
when
you
go
He
is
invisible
to
us
Sp
I
should
like
to
fight
him
Dr
Did
you
ever
read
the
Bible
Sp
Yes
a
long
time
ago
I
have
not
seen
one
for
a
long
time
Dr
You
remember
reading
in
the
Bible
about
obsessing
spirits
that
Jesus
cast
out
He
is
one
of
that
kind
Sp
They
are
all
around
that
woman
Mrs
B
Mrs
B
I
have
the
door
closed
now
Sp
If
you
keep
the
door
closed
I
ll
take
them
along
with
me
I
want
to
fight
with
that
fellow
anyhow
What
s
your
name
Dr
What
does
he
say
Sp
He
says
his
name
is
Jim
McDonald
Don
t
you
know
him
lady
If
he
is
a
spirit
for
goodness
sake
why
does
be
hang
on
to
that
woman
when
she
doesn
t
want
him
Dr
Perhaps
he
found
himself
there
as
you
find
yourself
here
You
say
you
saw
a
crowd
a
light
and
here
you
are
Sp
That
man
says
he
was
walking
in
the
dark
and
saw
that
lady
Say
will
I
always
have
to
stay
here
too

names
of
those
around
me
This
was
asked
by
another
patient
Sp
There
are
two
They
fight
once
in
a
while
I
see
them
fighting
Ques
I
fight
them
too
Dr
Do
not
fight
them
physically
that
gives
them
strength
and
magnetism
When
you
fight
them
in
that
way
you
give
them
much
more
strength
You
hold
them
by
fighting
them
as
you
do
Fight
them
mentally
Why
don
t
you
try
to
close
up
Sp
I
will
take
them
along
too
if
I
can
Don
t
fist
fight
them
any
more
I
don
t
know
what
s
the
matter
with
me
I
feel
strange
Dr
Where
was
your
home
Sp
It
was
in
Detroit
Michigan
Dr
What
year
can
you
recall
Sp
I
can
t
recall
any
Dr
Who
is
President
Sp
I
don
t
know
for
sure
but
I
think
Cleveland
Dr
He
was
President
a
long
time
ago
Sp
I
have
been
walking
so
long
that
I
feel
tired
Is
there
any
rest
for
a
weary
person
Have
you
a
bed
so
that
I
can
lie
down
and
rest
Dr
If
you
look
around
you
will
see
intelligent
spirits
Sp
Why
I
see
some
beautiful
girls
No
girls
I
will
not
come
with
you
Don
t
try
to
fool
me
I
m
not
going
with
you
not
much
Dr
They
are
different
from
the
girls
you
have
known
They
are
not
mortal
girls
they
are
spirits
Sp
They
have
a
smile
like
others
to
give
to
a
man
Dr
They
are
different
altogether
They
help
spirits
who
need
help
Sp
Those
girls
seem
to
be
honest
but
you
know
I
hate
women
Dr
You
should
not
condemn
them
all
because
one
was
false
Sp
You
see
I
want
to
take
all
those
folks
with
me
If
I
can
I
will
take
them
with
me
I
think
I
will
follow
those
girls
anyhow
Surprised
Why
there
s
my
mother
She
s
been
dead
and
gone
a
long
time
Dr
She
s
not
dead
SP
Don
t
you
think
she
s
in
Heaven
Dr
Ask
her
She
can
speak
for
herself
Sp
She
says
she
is
in
a
beautiful
place
called
the
spirit
world
Dr
The
spirit
world
surrounds
the
physical
Heaven
is
a
condition
within
you
when
you
have
found
that
you
will
be
contented
and
happy
That
is
what
Jesus
taught
also
Sp
I
should
like
to
go
with
my
mother
She
s
a
good
old
lady
I
want
to
take
McDonald
along
too
Come
here
McDonald
I
don
t
want
to
stay
around
here
any
longer
and
I
want
you
to
come
along
He
acts
as
if
he
is
trying
hard
to
wake
up
Say
come
on
McDonald
let
us
be
good
fellows
and
go
with
those
girls
for
they
might
be
honest
and
sincere
Mother
you
come
along
too
I
will
go
now
Goodby
Come
on
you
fellows
Say
what
do
you
stick
to
that
woman
for
anyhow
I
should
be
ashamed
of
myself
hanging
around
her
I
m
going
Goodbye
Mrs
B
Be
sure
and
take
them
along
with
you
Dr
What
is
your
name
Sp
Harry
That
is
all
I
can
remember
I
have
not
heard
my
name
for
many
years
Dr
Make
the
others
understand
the
folly
of
staying
Sp
I
m
going
to
take
those
fellows
along
Now
you
look
here
You
re
going
to
come
along
with
me
I
ll
fight
every
damned
one
of
you
that
won
t
come
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
stick
around
a
woman
like
you
do
Now
come
along
with
me
you
see
they
come
I
ll
look
after
them
all
right

Sp
Dead
The
idea
Say
what
s
the
matter

me
I
think
it
looks
very
funny
to
see
you
all
sitting
around
here
Are
you
having
a
meeting
or
what
is
it
called
anyhow
Dr
Yes
it
s
a
meeting
Try

You

Say
why

I

Dr
I
thought
you
were
a
woman
Sp
God
above
Why
do
you
think
I
m
a
woman
You
ll
have
to
look
again
because
I
am
a
man
sure
enough
and
I
ve
always
been
a
man
But
things
are
funny
and
I
don
t
know
it
has
been
so
peculiar
with
me
for
some
time
You
know
I
was
walking
along
and
then
I
heard
some
singing
so
I
thought
I
would
peek
in
and
before
I
knew
it
I
was
feeling
fine
You
know
I
have
not
been
feeling
well
for
some
time
everything
has
seemed
unusual
After
becoming
enmeshed
in
aura
of
sensitive
I
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
anyhow
Somebody
said
to
me
that
if
I
came
in
where
the
singing
was
I
would
find
out
what
is
the
matter
with
me
I
have
asked
everybody
I
saw
but
everybody
passed
by
they
were
so
stuck
up
they
wouldn
t
talk
to
a
fellow
any
more
The
people
all
looked
like
wax
to
me
Dear
life
I
ve
been
talking
and
talking
and
walking
and
walking
and
for
dear
life
I
could
never
get
any
one
to
answer
me
or
take
any
notice
of
me
before
As
a
spirit
he
was
invisible
to
mortals
and
therefore
unnoticed
by
them
You
are
the
first
one
to
answer
any
question
I
have
some
little
peculiar
kind
of
thing
in
my
throat
once
in
a
while
and
I
can
t
talk
and
then
I
seem
to
get
well
again
But
I
feel
queer
so
queer
Dr
Can
you
remember
anything
happening
to
you
at
some
time
Sp
Something
happens
every
day
One
time
I
remember
one
thing
and
another
time
something
else
but
I
don
t
remember
anything
clearly
I
cannot
for
dear
life
know
where
I
am
at
It
is
the
most
peculiar
thing
I
ever
saw
Dr
How
old
are
you
Sp
I
cannot
tell
you
that
I
haven
t
known
my
age
for
some
time
Nobody
ever
asks
me
about
that
and
the
natural
circumstance
is
that
I
forgot
Hearing
a
passing
train
Why
there
s
a
train
coming
It
s
a
long
time
since
I
heard
that
It
seems
I
live
again

a
short
time

don

know
what
it
is

Where
did
you
live
formerly
Where

I
cannot
seem
to
recall
things
There
are
times
that
I
can
tell
you
that
I
am
a
woman

then
I
get
some
kind
of
funny
thing
I
do
not
like
Static
treatment
of
patient
Dr
What
do
you
get
Sp
When
I
am
a
woman
I
have
long
hair

when
the
hair

hanging
down
this
funny
thing
begins
Mrs
Burton
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
her
hair
down
during
a
treatment
Dr
What
do
you
mean
Sp
It
seems
like
a
million
needles
strike
me
and
for
Gods
sake
it
is
the
worst
thing
I
ever
had
in
my
whole
life
I
don
t
want
to
be
a

only
get
that
funny
thing
when
I
am
a
woman
Seeing
Mrs
B

the
one

the
long
hair

Yes

mad

times

wants

away

She
probably
doesn

around
Possibly

bother

She
bothers
me
too

called
dead

this
time

Look
at

say

you
are
wearing
the
clothes

For

don

Another

patient
dislodged

sang
for
me
We
have
lost
her
I
have
been
hunting
and
hunting
for
her
Can
you
tell
me
where
she
is
Dr
She
left
that
lady
and
controlled
this
same
body
as
you
are
doing
now
After
that
she
went
to
the
spirit
world
That
is
where
you
are

Mrs

any
harm

Suppose
you
were
a
lady

some
spirit
bothered
you
would
you
like
it
Sp
Certainly
I
would
not
like
it
very
well
Dr
You
bothered
her
You
are
a
spirit

she
is
a
mortal
She
wants
to
get
rid
of
you

She
bothers
me
with
all
those
needles

hit
her
on

head

it
seems
like
the
needles
are
hitting
my
head

She
is
in
her
mortal
body

you
are
a
spirit
invisible
to
us
Sp
What
do
you
mean
Dr
Just
exactly
what
I
say
Your
mind
is
invisible
to
us
You
are
temporarily
controlling
my
wife

body

Why
I
never
saw
your
wife

I
do
not
want
to

Will
tell

one
thing
I
am

will
never

anything
else

want

You
may
be
a
man
as
you
claim
but
I
want

recognize
the
fact
that

Noticing
clothes

For
the
land
s
sake
alive
when
did
these
clothes
come
on
me
Dr
They
have
been
on
you
quite
a
while
How
did
you
get
here
Sp
Somebody
said
You
go
in
there
and
you
will
get
understanding
because
you
do
not
need
to
wander
as
you
are
doing
And
now
I
am
a
woman
Dr
Only
temporarily
Try
to
understand
what
I
am
telling
you
You
lost
your
body
perhaps
a
long
time
ago
Sp
That
woman
Mrs
B
is
the
fault
of
it
Dr
You
have
been
bothering
that
lady
probably
for
many
years
and
you
may
have
been
troubling
others
What
is
your
name
Sp
I
can
t
think
Dr
You
lost
your
own
body
and
have
been
wandering
around
in
that
outer
darkness
which
is
described
in
the
Bible
Were
you
a
religious
man
Sp
I
don
t
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
churches
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
them
all
They
all
say
if
you
do
not
do
so
and
so
you
will
go
straight
to
hell
where
you
will
bum
forever
They
teach
and
preach
damnation
you
know
I
was
quite
a
young
man
when
a
minister
told
me
I
would
go
to
that
terrible
hell
and
they
did
not
want
me
in
the
church
any
more
because
I
did
not
do
as
they
said
I
should
I
did
not
believe
any
of
it
I
was
not
such
a
very
bad
man
After
I
left
that
church
I
thought
I
would
try
another
For
dear
life
I
got
into
the
same
hell
and
damnation
and
I
was
tired
of
it
all
They
talked
of
God
and
holy
things
They
said
I
should
give
my
money
to
God
They
said
I
should
give
my
tobacco
to
God
I
could
not
see
why
God
should
need
my
tobacco
and
what
little
money
I
had
I
could
not
see
things
that
way
so
I
left
that
church
I
went
to
another
church
and
they
talked
and
talked
to
me
After
awhile
they
said
that
the
devil
was
after
me
because
I
would
not
give
my
money
to
the
church
One
time
I
had
been
out
with
the
boys
for
a
while
I
never
drank
too
much
but
I
drank
enough
that
time
to
be
lively
I
thought
now
I
will
go
right
straight
up
to
the
front
and
sit
down
so
I
did
They
tried
to
save
my
soul
for
God
so
they
told
me
The
minister
said
that
the
devil
was
right
after
me
and
I
got
pretty
seared
He
said
And
he
is
going
to
get
you
I
thought
I
would
look
behind
and
probably
I
might
see
him
but
I
didn
t
He
said
Come
up
come
up
and
we
will
save
your
soul
from
hell
come
and
be
saved
Come
to
the
front
and
be
converted
You
will
be
born
again
I
was
a
little
contrary
for
a
while
and
then
I
got
up
and
went
right
up
to
the
front
as
I
wanted
to
see
what
they
would
do
The
minister
said
Now
you
kneel
down
there
So
I
knelt
down
He
put
his
hands
on
my
head
and
they
all
sang
and
sang
and
they
prayed
and
prayed
for
me
They
said
Be
converted
now
I
thought
it
was
grand
all
the
girls
putting
their
hands
on
me
and
singing
and
praying
for
me
Then
the
minister
came
again
and
he
said
You
will
have
to
pray
or
the
devil
will
get
after
you
I
could
not
be
a
hypocrite
so
I
told
him
if
I
was
a
sinner
I
would
have
to
stay
one
I
don
t
believe
the
devil
is
a
person
anyhow
so
I
told
him
and
he
was
angry
He
thought
I
was
a
bad
pill
They
tried
all
they
could
to
convert
me
but
it
was
no
good
so
I
finally
went
away
After
I
left
there
some
men
came
after
me
so
I
ran
as
hard
as
I
could
then
somebody
struck
me
on
the
head
and
I
had
great
pain
I
fell
down
but
I
got
up
again
I
wanted
to
give
that
man
a
push
down
the
hill
but
he
pushed
me
and
I
rolled
and
rolled
down
that
hill
There
were
lots
of
people
around
me
after
I
stopped
rolling
and
all
at
once
I
felt
all
right
again
Dr
That
was
probably
the
time
you
lost
your
physical
body
You
died
Sp
I
did
not
die
Dr
What
place
was
it
where
you
rolled
down
the
hill
Sp
It
was
down
in
Texas
I
walked
and
ran
and
tried
to
talk
to
people
but
they
would
not
answer
me
they
seemed
like
sticks
I
felt
so
queer
in
my
head
I
asked
them
if
they
could
tell
me
where
my
home
was
I
felt
that
pain
Once
in
a
while
I
could
get
away
I
then
came
to
a
lady
and
she
said
Come
along
and
before
I
knew
it
we
had
a
crowd
around
us
and
she
used
to
sing
Evidently
the
spirit
Carrie
Huntington
The
Patient
Mrs
B
had
often
been
annoyed
by
the
singing
of
spirits
I
talked
to
her
once
in
a
while
and
then
all
at
once
she
disappeared
and
after
that
I
got
the
needles
Came
more
fully
into
control
of
patient
and
felt
electrical
treatments
more
keen
I
felt
them
pretty
bad
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
and
are
now
using
my
wife
s
body
Sp
How
in
the
world
did
I
get
into
your
wife
s
body
Do
You
like
your
wife
to
be
all
kinds
of
tramps
Dr
Yes
long
enough
to
give
the
spirits
an
understanding
regarding
the
invisible
side
Sp
Are
these
your
wife
s
clothes
Did
I
borrow
them
for
a
while
Did
your
wife
dress
me
I
am
sorry
to
show
myself
like
a
woman
and
not
like
a
man
What
will
these
people
think
that
I
m
crazy
Laughter
It
isn
t
funny
Dr
You
are
an
ignorant
spirit
in
outer
darkness
Intelligent
spirits
have
brought
you
here
to
control
this
body
temporarily
so
that
you
can
understand
your
condition
Also
they
took
you
away
from
that
lady
Mrs
B
Sp
Will
she
get
those
awful
needles
again
Dr
Are
there
any
more
persons
where
you
came
from
Or
are
you
the
last
one
Sp
The
woman
and
the
other
man
went
then
you
gave
me
the
needles
I
kicked
like
a
steer
to
get
out
but
I
could
not
How
could
you
expect
me
to
do
any
better
I
thought
of
the
minister
that
talked
about
hell
Dr
That
hell
was
not
like
this
There
are
spirits
here
who
will
teach
you
how
to
progress
in
the
spirit
world
they
will
help
you
Is
your
father
living
Sp
I
don
t
know
I
haven
t
seen
my
father
for
about
twenty
five
or
thirty
years
Mother
is
dead
but
I
don
t
know
whether
father
is
or
not
I
don
t
know
any
of
my
relatives
Mrs
B
Did
I
meet
you
last
November
Sp
Yes
I
have
been
ill
ever
since
that
time
I
was
not
the
one
that
was
with
you
close
that
was
the
young
lady
My
head
is
hurting
me
terribly
Dr
What
year
do
you
think
it
should
be
Sp
I
should
think
about
or
Dr
It
is
now
Sp
I
think
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
me
Dr
You
have
been
in
outer
darkness
for
some
time
Sp
I
have
been
walking
and
walking
and
I
got
with
that
lady
over
there
Mrs
B
I
wanted
to
go
I
kicked
and
she
kicked
and
we
had
regular
kickings
Oh
look
there
See
My
Mother
Oh
Mother
Can
you
forgive
me
I
was
not
as
you
wanted
me
to
be
Mother
will
you
take
me
I
am
so
tired
I
need
your
care
and
help
Will
you
take
me
Oh
my
Mother
Dr
What
does
she
say
Sp
She
calls
me
She
says
Yes
Frank
you
will
come
with
me
I
have
been
looking
for
you
a
long
time
I
am
getting
weak
I
feel
so
tired
Mother
says
Frank
we
had
not
the
understanding
of
the
real
life
because
we
were
not
taught
what
we
should
have
been
taught
so
that
we
did
not
learn
to
know
God
s
wonderful
universe
Religion
is
a
long
way
from
the
real
life
The
ministers
all
teach
that
we
should
just
believe
and
then
we
are
saved
No
no
belief
is
only
a
setback
Get
knowledge
of
God
We
do
not
do
that
Frank
we
will
help
you
to
learn
what
a
beautiful
world
there
is
on
the
other
side
when
we
have
understanding
You
have
to
make
your
own
efforts
to
learn
to
understand
the
Golden
Rule
of
God
s
beautiful
teaching
of
life
and
be
of
help
and
service
to
your
fellowman
Now
Frank
she
says
you
have
been
very
mischievous
in
your
life
I
know
you
were
a
good
boy
but
you
always
were
too
lively
You
were
ignorant
of
the
real
life
and
went
away
from
home
when
I
died
The
home
was
broken
up
you
went
one
way
and
the
rest
went
another
I
did
not
know
Frank
what
things
were
but
I
wish
the
truth
could
be
taught
She
says
Now
come
with
me
to
the
spirit
world
where
we
have
understanding
There
we
have
love
harmony
peace
and
bliss
but
we
have
to
live
for
one
another
You
have
to
go
to
school
and
learn
You
must
not
bother
any
one
any
more
as
you
have
done
Come
Frank
and
we
will
go
to
a
beautiful
home
in
the
spirit
world
Thank
you
and
Goodby
Several

She

She
gets
the
worst
kind
of
things
She
gets
up
on
something
puts
something
over
her
head
and
then
fire
comes
When
Mrs
Burton
seated
herself
upon
a
platform
beside
the
static
machine
she
covered
her
head
with
a
woolen
blanket
to
make

more
effective

If

could
get

head

that
fire
I
should
be
all
right
It
seems

pieces
How

anyone
stand
being
shot
at

That
was
done

They
were
brought

That

where
you
should
be
Why
should
you
hover
around
that
woman
Sp
Hover
around
nothing
I
have
been
in
a
prison
but
I
could
not
help
it
I
did
what
I
could

get
out
Those
people

they
would
help

they
didn

I
made
quite
a
disturbance

they
went

Mrs

You
ought

thank
Doctor

That

CHAPTER

Earth
Sphere
Conditions
and
the
Magnetic
Aura
UNENLIGHTENED
Spirits
often
wander
aimlessly
for
many
years
in
the
earth
sphere
their
lack
of
knowledge
of
a
higher
spirit
world
which
is
attained
only
through
understanding
keeping
them
in
a
dreary
condition
of
confusion
monotony
and
suffering
many
remain
in
the
scenes
of
their
earth
lives
continuing
their
former
activities
while
others
fall
into
a
state
of
heavy
sleep
from
which
they
are
with
difficulty
aroused
A
spirit
who
was
still
following
his
old
occupation
without
any
knowledge
of
his
transition
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
at
one
of
our
circles
in
Chicago
Why
are
you
sitting
in
the
dark
he
asked
We
were
at
that
time
experimenting
with
dark
circles
I
am
Hesselroth
from
the
drug
store
he
said
Mr
Hesselroth
the
Swedish
proprietor
of
a
Chicago
drug
store
had
died
the
year
before
in
a
hospital
but
we
knew
nothing
of
this
man
his
death
or
his
circumstances
however
on
this
evening
one
of
his
friends
Mr
Eckholm
was
in
our
circle
The
spirit
was
not
aware
of
his
death
claiming
that
he
was
still
attending
to
his
drug
store
His
friend
in
the
circle
said
he
had
been
informed
that
the
drug
store
had
been
sold
to
the
clerk
and
so
stated
to
the
spirit
but
this
the
latter
emphatically
denied
saying
Abrahamson
only
manages
it
for
me
The
spirit
told
of
a
robbery
which
had
occurred
in
his
house
recently
and
described
the
three
burglars
He
said
he
had
been
frightened
when
they
entered
but
gaining
courage
had
gone
for
his
revolver
only
to
find
that
he
was
not
able
to
pick
it
up
He
had
then
struck
at
one
of
the
burglars
but
his
hand
had
gone
right
through
the
fellow
and
he
could
not
understand
why
he
could
do
nothing
at
all
After
his
condition
was
explained
to
him
he
saw
many
spirit
friends
appear
who
welcomed
him
to
his
new
home
in
the
spirit
world
Later
investigation
verified
the
statement
made
by
the
spirit
that
the
drug
store
had
not
been
sold
and
also
the
fact
that
the
house
had
been
burglarized
It
could
not
be
held
that
the
subconscious
mind
of
the
psychic
played
any
part
in
this
case
nor
could
the
theory
of
auto
suggestion
be
maintained
for
Mr
Hesselroth
was
entirely
unknown
to
every
one
in
the
room
with
the
exception
of
his
friend
Mr
Eckholm
and
this
friend
held
the
opposite
idea
regarding
the
sale
of
the
store
Many
years
later
this
spirit
returned
to
us
in
California
speaking
again
through
Mrs
Wickland
EXPERIENCE

Spirit
MR
HESSELROTH
Spirit
I
have
come
in
to
say
just
a
few
words
for
I
have
been
helped
out
of
darkness
and
have
become
a
helper
in
the
Band
of
Mercy
Doctor
Who
are
you
friend
Sp
I
am
one
of
the
helpers
here
I
come
around
sometimes
and
I
came
tonight
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
I
was
once
in
a
very
dark
condition
but
now
I
am
one
of
your
Band
I
thought
you
might
like
to
know
If
it
had
not
been
for
you
I
would
probably
still
be
in
the
dark
Many
years
have
passed
I
have
quite
an
understanding
of
life
now
through
you
and
through
this
little
circle
of
the
Band
of
Mercy
It
was
not
here
it
was
in
Chicago
that
I
was
helped
I
am
very
much
pleased
to
be
here
with
you
tonight
I
should
like
to
give
you
my
name
but
I
seem
to
have
forgotten
it
because
I
have
not
heard
it
for
so
long
It
will
come
to
me
and
then
I
will
give
it
Do
you
remember
an
old
gentleman
you
used
to
know
Mr
Eckholm
He
was
not
so
very
old
either
He
was
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
and
through
him
I
came
to
see
you
Dr
At
some
meeting
in
Chicago
Sp
Yes
I
had
a
drug
store
in
Chicago
My
name
is
Hesselroth
I
could
not
think
of
my
name
for
a
moment
I
am
one
of
your
helpers
here
Mr
Eckholm
is
with
me
and
he
also
does
all
he
can
He
is
very
happy
to
help
with
your
work
here
He
was
heart
and
soul
with
it
during
his
earth
life
I
also
feel
that
I
have
to
do
all
I
can
to
help
because
if
you
had
not
helped
me
I
should
have
been
in
that
drug
store
yet
selling
medicine
For
a
whole
year
after
I
passed
out
I
attended
to
the
business
as
I
did
when
on
earth
only
I
did
not
feel
that
I
was
sick
any
more
I
took
sick
in
the
store
and
was
sent
to
the
hospital
and
I
passed
out
in
the
hospital
They
took
my
body
to
the
undertakers
not
to
my
home
You
know
it
says
in
the
Bible
Where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
When
I
woke
up
from
the
sleep
of
death
I
thought
of
my
store
and
there
I
found
myself
I
saw
that
everything
was
going
on
all
right
but
it
seemed
so
strange
that
I
could
not
talk
to
any
of
my
customers
I
thought
that
during
my
sickness
I
had
lost
my
faculty
of
speech
so
I
did
not
think
much
about
it
I
attended
to
business
and
I
impressed
my
clerk
to
do
things
I
wanted
done
I
was
running
the
store
and
the
clerk
was
managing
it
for
me
I
did
not
realize
that
I
was
dead
until
I
came
to
this
gentleman
Dr
W
in
his
little
circle
When
burglars
got
into
my
home
I
thought
of
the
revolver
that
I
always
kept
in
a
drawer
I
went
there
and
tried
and
tried
to
get
it
but
my
hand
went
me
I
commenced
to
see
things
I
saw
my
spirit
father
and
mother
Then
I
thought
I
must
be
a
little
out
of
my
head
So
I
thought
I
had
better
go
up
to
see
my
friend
Eckholm
I
always
thought
he
was
just
a
little
off
because
he
believed
in
Spiritualism
I
wanted
to
see
Eckholm
to
ask
him
if
ghosts
could
come
back
and
there
I
was
a
ghost
myself
Then
I
came
to
this
circle
and
I
found
I
could
talk
and
after
a
while
the
door
opened
opened
to
that
beautiful
land
beyond
I
wish
you
could
see
the
reception
I
had
My
relatives
and
friends
all
opened
their
arms
to
me
and
said
Welcome
to
our
home
in
spirit
Welcome
to
that
everlasting
life
Welcome
to
an
understanding
of
God
Such
a
reception
cannot
be
described
until
you
see
it
for
yourselves
and
are
with
us
That
is
happiness
it
is
Heaven
I
will
not
take
any
more
of
your
time
but
I
am
glad
that
I
could
come
and
talk
tonight
It
was
about
fifteen
years
ago
that
I
first
came
here
Eckholm
says
he
feels
proud
of
this
work
and
he
sends
love
to
all
of
you
here
Now
Good
Night
Pathos
and
tragedy
are
often
the
grim
accompaniment
of
the
sufferings
of
earthbound
spirits
The
spirit
of
the
following
narrative
was
taken
from
a
patient
who
was
subject
to
doleful
spells
of
crying
and
afflicted
with
intense
head
pains
all
of
which
ceased
after
the
spirit
was
removed

I
have
been
running
all
over
trying

Mama
died
a
long
time

when
I
was
a
little

After

died
Papa
was
so
mean
to

Willie
and
he
hit
me
so
many
times
I
feel
so
bad

I
have
been
to
so
many
places

my
Ma
is
dead

I
don

where
to
go
Dr
You
were
in
such
mental
distress
that
you
did
not
realize
your
condition
You
have
lost
your
physical
body
and
your
friends
would
call
you
dead
Sp
Did
I
die
Sometimes
I
feel
as
if
I
were
in
a
box
We
were
a
big
crowd
spirits
obsessing
the
patient
and
they
Pushed
and
pushed
and
there
was
one
big
man
and
he
was
so
mean
to
us
He
chased
us
one
way
then
another
but
one
day
we
lost
him
This
tormenting
spirit
had
been
attracted
from
the
patient
two
days
before
I
felt
so
glad
he
was
lost
and
I
thought
I
could
be
quiet
but
I
got
all
those
needles
Dr
You
were
influencing
a
lady
and
making
her
cry
Sp
What
do
you
mean
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
and
were
in
the
aura
of
that
lady
When
she
had
an
electrical
treatment
you
felt
it
and
left
her
You
are
using
my

body
now
Look
at
your
hands
do
they
belong
to
you

Oh
look
I
have
a
ring
But
that
is
not
mine
and
I
have
not
stolen
it
Excitedly
Take
it
away
I
didn
t
steal
that
ring
Dr
This
is
not
your
body
and
that
is
not
your
ring
It
is
very
likely
that
you
died
when
your
head
was
hurt
The
spirit
lives
after
the
body
dies
Sp
But
I
have
been
alive
Dr
You
were
living
but
without
a
physical
body
and
came
in
touch
with
a
sensitive
a
lady
who
is
now
in
the
other
house
She
acts
just
as
you
do
and
complains
of
her
head
hurting
in
the
same
place
yours
hurts
you
She
has
been
acting
like
an
insane
person
but
it
is
all
due
to
spirit
influence
Sp
The
man
was
so
mean
that
we
had
with
us
but
now
he
is
lost
and
we
are
so
glad
We
were
all
seared
of
him
but
we
could
not
run
away
from
him
He
was
awful
mean
he
bit
and
scratched
and
would
fight
Dr
He
was
very
obstinate
He
was
controlling
this
body
a
short
time
ago
just
as
you
are
now
We
have
circles
like
this
where
spirits
may
come

Sp
Spirits
I
don

know
anything

Dr
The
body
you
are
using
belongs
to
my
wife
and
she
has
no
pain
in
her
head
Sp
Those
needles
hurt
me
so
much
Dr
When
the
lady
had
a
treatment
today
you
evidently
were
able
to
get
away
and
are
now
allowed
to
control
this
body
So
that
we
can
help
you
A
short

you
said

your

were

Your

probably
comes
for
forgiveness
You
understand
he
cannot
progress
in
the

you
forgive
him
Ask
him
what

He
says

got

hit

God
give

All
I

that
poor

struck

tried

ask

she
shrank

accusing

head
all
split
open

the
blood
pouring
out

have
had
hell

hard

help

I
was
no

I
loved

I
had

bad

I
really
killed
my

letting
her
sew
just
to
keep

I
made

there
were
always
men
around
telling
me
to
come
with
them
and
I
did
not
know
anything
until
my
wages
were
all
gone
and
I
went
home
feeling
like
a
devil
Dr
Perhaps
the
trouble
was
not
all
yours
for
you
might
have
been
obsessed
When
you
leave
here
with
your
wife
you
will
find
a
wonderful
spirit
world
Sp
I
am
not
worthy
to
go
with
my
wife
but
I
will
try
to
do
good
I
don
t
want
you
to
go
away
from
me
any
more

Minnie
can
you
forgive
your
Papa
My
dear
child
I
killed
you
but
I
did
not
mean
to
Forgive
your
Papa
Will
I
wake
up
after
a
while

find
myself
in
darkness
again
Am
I
asleep

dreaming
Minnie
don

go
away
from
Papa
Please
forgive
me
Dr
You
are
neither
asleep
nor
dreaming
but
are
beginning
to
realize
your
condition
Sp
Did
they
kill
me
when
they
hit
me
in
my
neck
and
head
They
shot
me
Dr
We
can
t
say
certainly
but
they
probably
did
Sp
If
I
can
just
have
one
more
chance
I
will
do
my
level
best
to
keep
my
family
together
Dr
There
is
something
else
you
can
do
also
after
you
acquire
understanding
it
will
be
your
duty
to
help
poor
unfortunate
spirits
who
are
obsessing
mortals
making
devils
of
some
of
them
When
you
had
your
own
body
you
may
have
been
obsessed
by
some
spirits
Sp
I
did
not
care
for
drink
I
hated
the
very
sight
of
it
But
when
once
I
got
just
a
smell
of
it
something
took
hold
of
me
and
made
me
feel
like
a
devil
and
I
could
not
resist
it
I
could
not
do
anything
with
myself
God
help
me
and
give
me
just
a
little
comfort
Dr
When
you
leave
here
you
will
be
reunited
with
your
family
Sp
Are
you
sure
about
that
Dr
Positive
but
you
must
do
as
the
advanced
spirits
instruct
you
Sp
If
there
is
anything
I
can
do
to
help
you
I
will
do
it
because
you
have
reunited
me
with
my
family
I
came
home
drunk
and
you
don
t
know
how
I
felt
when
I
realized
that
my
wife
was
dying
I
was
so
drunk
that
I
did
not
fully
realize
things
until
the
next
morning
when
I
woke
up
and
there
was
my
wife
dead
I
could
not
understand
it
What
was
I
to
do
What
could
I
do
with
the
children
My
wife
dead
My
wife
and
Minnie
say
they
will
both
forgive
me
and
now
I
have
my
wife
and
two
children
and
I
am
going
to
start
all
over
again
God
bless
you
all
for
what
you
have
done
for

You

You

You
were
singing
That
Beautiful
Shore

while
you
are
singing

you
know
you
are
lying
Dr
Do
you
imply
that
life
does
not
mean
anything
at
all
Sp
It
most
certainly
does
not
There
is
nothing
in
it
It
is
just
a
lie
The
whole
thing

nothing

a
pack

lies
both
life

Do
you
really

Did
you
seek
for
truth
when
you
had
your
own
body

I
prayed
to
God

all
that
nonsense
Gosh
Dr
And
you
found
it
all
a
humbug
What
has
that
to
do
with
the
actual
facts

life

Once
I
tried
to
be

the
thought
came
to
me
that
everything

humbug

It
was
not

What
next
Sp
Yes
what
next
I
worked
like
a
slave
for
a
minister
of
God
I
do
not
work
for
him
now
that
was
some
time
ago
I
went
away
from
there
He
cursed
me
and
I
had
my
cares

troubles
I
swore
to
God
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
God
if
he
could
be
so
mean
as
to
call
such
a
man
his
minister
And
I
lost
faith
Dr
What
has
that
to
do
with
the
facts
of
life
and
the
hereafter

When
you
die

didn

Stay
dead

haven

yet
Dr
You
died
as
far
as
your
body
is
concerned
Sp
I
have
been
running
away
from
those
hypocrites
In
the
first
place
they
took
all
the
money
I
made
If
there
is
a
God
then
for
God
s
sake
why
does
he
always
want
money
They
always
say
you
must
have
faith
have
faith
and
pay
your
money
to
the
church
and
you
should
work
for
God
My
work
was
hard
I
worked
from
six
o
clock
every
morning

late

night
all

worked

Oh

hundred
years
from

I
ve
lost
faith
in
God
humanity

everything

everybody
I
used
to
have
faith
Then
a
servant
of
God
took
my
wife

children
away
from
me
and
yet
I
worked
for
God
from
six
in
the
morning
to
twelve
at
night
Dr
But
you
did
not
add
understanding
to
your
faith
Sp
I
had
faith
in
the
Holy
Ghost
and
the
Spirit
Dr
Why
did
you
not
add
understanding
to
your
faith
Sp
I
had
faith
enough
to
move
mountains
We
were
taught
to
just
have
faith
in
the
Holy
Spirit
Just
look
at
them
all
spirits
sitting
there
Look
at
that
one
Here
you
Calango
He
and
I
have
fights
once
in
a
while
but
I
always
get
the
best
of
him
I
can
talk
better
now
than
I
have
done
for
a
long
time
Here
you
Calango
sitting
there
like
a
fool
They
told
me
to
go
in
there
so
I
came
in
I
think
you
were
afraid
of
me
at
first

I
came
in
just
the
same

How
did

come
in

In

Touching
Mrs
Wickland

mine

doesn

fellows
Dr
Now
stop
talking

Do

boss
here
Dr
Yes

I
have
no
faith
in
you

any
one
else
Dr
I
want
you
to
understand
that
you
have
lost
your
physical
body
You
are
controlling
my
wife

body
yet
you
are
invisible
to
us
You
talk
about
those
men
sitting
there
we
cannot
see
them
We
are
in
mortal
bodies

you
have
lost
your
physical
body

Can
t
you
see
me
Dr
We
cannot
see

You

Intelligent

have
brought
you
here

You
asked
me
to
come
All
those
in
darkness
came
in
too
You
invited
us
During
a
concentration
for
all
earthbound
spirits
Dr
I
said
you
should
listen
to
intelligent
spirits
around
you
who
would
help
you
You
are
all
in
darkness

Yes
but
you
invited
us
in
and
here
we
are
I
want
to
tell
you
if
you
don
t
want
us
I
won
t
talk
Dr
You
were
invited
by
intelligent
spirits
to
come
here
and
allowed
to
control
my
wife
s
body
so
that
we
could
help
you
understand
that
you
no
longer
have
a
mortal
body
The
church
has
not
the
right
understanding
of
God
You
found
humbug
in
the
church
so
you
think
everything
is
humbug
You
lost
your
body
probably
a
long
time
ago
My
wife
is
a
psychic
sensitive
and
you
are
temporarily
controlling
her
body
Look
about
perhaps
you
can
see
some
one
you
know
Sp
I
can
see
Calango
Dr
You
must
realize
that
life
means
something
Sp
I
have
had
faith
and
enough
of
it
too
I
sacrificed
my
money
and
my
wife
and
you
see
where
I
am
Dr
What
has
that
to
do
with
the
facts
of
life
Did
you
ever
study
the
wonders
of
Nature
Sp
I
do
not
believe
in
God
there
is
no
such
thing
Dr
God
has
nothing
to
do
with
humbug
Did
you
understand
the
Bible
at
all
The
Bible
says
God
is
Love
Humbuggery
has
nothing
to
do
with
universal
life
We
want
to
help
you
understand
better
things

No

ever
helps
me

Do
you
know

Los
Angeles
California

No

Try
to
understand
what
the
real
life
means
it
means
something
you
do
not
know

you
ever

vegetation

Break

egg

Take
another

a
chicken
comes
out
of
it
Sp
That
s
natural
Dr
What
produces
the
chicken
We
must
add
knowledge
to
our
faith
The
Bible
says
God
is
spirit
and
they
that
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
You
do
not
find
that
in
the
churches
They
only
have
blind
faith
Sp
I
sure
had
faith
Dr
The
Bible
says
Know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
Although
the
Bible
is
not
a
Holy
Book
it
contains
some
wonderful
truths
Sp
I
don
t
believe
it
Laughing
Dr
You
re
laughing
at
your
own
ignorance
My
wife
allows
ignorant
spirits
to
control
her
body
so
that
we
can
bring
them
to
an
understanding
of
their
condition
She
wants
you
to
know
that
life
exists
on
the
other
side
We
do
not
know
where
you
came
from
but
we
allow
you
to
control
my
wife
s
body
Where
was
your
home
Sp
My
home
That
was
in
Canada
near
Montreal
Dr
I
was
there
in
Are
you
a
French
Canadian
Sp
My
great
grandfather
was
Dr
Do
you
remember
your
name
Sp
I
can
t
remember
things
Dr
Now
we
want
you
to
understand
things
Sp
I
was
a
slave
Dr
That
is
all
in
the
past
Sp
I
only
see
the
past
and
it
makes
me
crazy
Instead
of
crying
as
many
do
I
thought
I
would
laugh
at
everything
Whenever
I
got
so
mad
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
I
started
to
laugh
I
guess
I
felt
a
little
better
for
laughing
instead
of
crying
I
had
my
heart
sorrows
they
took
my
wife
my
home
went
my
children
went
My
wife
was
a
very
pretty
girl
One
day
I
came
home
from
my
work
and
I
had
worked
very
hard
My
wife
and
children
were
gone
But
after
a
while
that
minister
of
God
did
not
want
my
wife
any
more
then
she
commenced
to
go
back
on
him
but
by
that
time
I
had
gone
down
I
said
no
church
for
mine
that
if
one
of
God
s
ministers
can
break
up
my
home
and
take
my
wife
and
children
then
there
is
no
God
I
went
clear
down
to
hell
for
that
fellow
I
went
down
and
down
but
even
down
there
in
the
gutter
you
find
friendship
and
love
for
each
other
If
you
are
down
they
too
are
down
with
you
All
the
other
people
look
down
on
you
but
believe
me
these
others
are
true
friends
They
will
help
you
and
divide
whatever
they
have
with
you
No
matter
how
down
you
are
if
you
haven
t
a
cent
you
will
find
they
will
help
you
One
day
I
will
never
forget
what
I
saw
never
forget
God
if
there
is
a
God
why
in
the
name
of
the
devil
does
he
allow
such
things
One
day
I
met
my
wife
Where
was
she
She
had
gone
down
to
the
gutter
I
found
her
in
one
of
those
fine
houses
you
hear
about
where
that
filthy
devil
had
put
her
when
he
was
through
with
her
I
looked
at
her
and
she
looked
at
me
You
here
I
said
And
she
said
You
here
Why
are
you
here
I
asked
What
are
you
here
for
she
asked
I
said
I
came
here
probably
of
my
own
free
will
She
said
she
had
been
put
there
by
that
glorious
minister
of
God
to
hide
his
own
shame
To
hide
his
own
dirty
work
and
not
have
people
ask
her
questions
he
put
her
in
a
fast
house
and
let
her
stay
there
and
she
did
not
care
for
anything
We
were
both
down
all
because
of
that
devil
I
have
never
gone
to
church
since
I
cursed
that
man
and
all
religious
cranks
My
wife
wouldn
t
have
anything
to
do
with
me
and
I
wouldn
t
have
her
She
was
lying
there
full
of
disease
There
is
not
an
animal
living
that
goes
so
low
as
a
woman
when
she
goes
to
the
dogs
Can
any
one
believe
in
a
God
that
would
let
a
woman
like
my
wife
suffer
as
she
did
through
no
fault
of
her
own
Why
should
such
things
exist
Dr
Why
didn
t
you
use
the
reason
God
gave
you
Sp
There
are
hundreds
of
people
living
low
down
and
they
don
t
care
where
they
go
Dr
Now
you
are
going
to
care
Let
me
talk
now
You
went
to
church
and
adopted
a
blind
faith
that
you
admit
Sp
I
wanted
to
be
a
good
man
Dr
Didn
t
you
feel
a
desire
for
something
higher
You
merely
had
faith
and
did
not
add
understanding
God
gave
you
sense
he
gave
you
intelligent
reasoning
faculties
but
you
adopted
a
blind
faith
and
clung
to
it
That
was
not
God
s
fault
To
our
faith
we
must
add
knowledge
and
that
will
make
us
free
God
did
not
write
the
Bible
Sp
It
is
a
Holy
Book
That
is
what
they
say
Dr
It
was
written
by
man
Did
you
ever
analyze
the
marvels
of
the
human
mind
I
am
talking
of
facts
now
Did
you
ever
realize
how
wonderful
the
human
body
is
or
how
the
invisible
mind
is
able
to
control
the
material
body
Did
you
ever
see
the
wonders
of
Nature
Sp
All
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
misery
Dr
If
you
had
used
your
own
faculties
you
would
understand
that
love
and
mind
are
invisible
Sp
Didn
t
that
devil
love
my
wife
Dr
That
was
not
love
You
did
not
use
your
faculties
You
joined
the
church
in
blind
faith
without
using
your
reason
We
do
not
see
you
you
are
invisible
to
us
and
are
using
my
wife
s
body
temporarily
We
are
interested
in
the
condition
of
the
so
called
dead
and
many
of
them
are
brought
here
to
be
enlightened
You
have
been
brought
here
by
intelligent
spirits
so
that
you
can
learn
to
understand
your
true
condition
You
have
an
opportunity
to
progress
in
the
spirit
world
but
you
must
forget
your
hatred
You
lost
your
physical
body
Do
you
know
what
year
it
is
It
is
and
you
are
in
California
Sp
How
did
I
get
here
I
never
was
in
California
Dr
How
does
spirit
travel
You
spoke
of
other
people
here
we
do
not
see
them
We
do
not
see
you
You
are
using
my
wife
s
organism
Can
t
you
see
how
wonderful
life
is
Sp
Why
aren
t
we
taught
those
things
Dr
Because
the
truth
is
not
in
the
people
You
will
have
to
judge
for
yourself
between
the
facts
of
life
and
the
creed
of
the
church
Churches
are
man
made
things
God
is
Spirit
and
you
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
in
spirit
and
in
truth
We
have
aspirations
for
a
higher
life
but
that
does
not
give
us
knowledge
God
is
Spirit
invisible
Intelligence
He
manifests
himself
in
all
the
wonders
of
the
Universe
Sp
All
these
people
here
invisibles
have
had
disappointments
as
I
have
but
all
have
different
stories
We
sit
and
talk
to
each
other
from
time
to
time
all
telling
of
the
past
All
have
their
troubles
Dr
God
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
that
The
Universe
is
God
s
Temple
and
our
souls
are
His
Manifestations
Think
of
the
marvelous
things
in
the
Universe
You
speak
of
your
friends
being
here
yet
we
cannot
see
them
Sp
They
want
to
know
if
you
can
help
them
all
from
their
troubles
Dr
Yes
we
can
Tell
them
that
life
means
something
Look
around
and
you
may
see
intelligent
spirits
who
will
help
you
Sp
There
are
six
of
us
and
we
have
all
had
the
same
trouble
and
disappointment
but
each
has
a
different
story
Dr
Tell
them
that
none
of
you
need
be
in
the
condition
you
are
in
Sp
There
s
one
group
called
The
Laughing
Fools
there
s
another
called
The
Cursing
Fools
there
s
another
called
The
Swearing
Fools
there
s
another
called
The
Singing
Fools
They
sing
and
pray
from
morning
until
night
You
get
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
them
Dr
The
Bible
says
As
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
Religious
fanatics
are
the
worst
They
have
not
added
understanding
to
their
blind
faith
We
all
have
faculties
but
do
not
use
them
Is
that
God
s
fault
Sp
I
have
not
worked
for
a
long
time
Sometimes
none
of
us
have
any
food
We
have
done
without
it
so
long
that
now
we
do
not
seem
to
need
it
Dr
The
spirit
does
not
need
food
Sp
We
are
starving
starving
Dr
Spiritually
starving
Sp
We
are
all
starving
for
something
but
we
don
t
know
what
it
is
We
are
all
anxious
to
know
We
all
say
that
our
souls
cry
out
for
something
but
we
don
t
know
what
it
is
None
of
us
want
to
pray
For
my
part
I
cannot
I
had
faith
and
prayed
but
here
I
am
in
all
this
trouble
Dr
God
has
given
each
one
of
you
reasoning
faculties
Sp
Would
you
help
us
all
They
all
say
they
are
hungry
for
happiness
All
we
can
see
is
our
past
and
we
all
want
something
higher
All
I
can
see
is
my
wife
as
I
saw
her
last
down
down
Dr
So
far
as
your
wife
is
concerned
it
was
only
her
body
that
was
diseased
not
her
spirit
Sp
When
we
saw
each
other
we
both
cried
Dr
After
you
have
understanding
you
can
all
do
a
great
work
in
helping
others
Listen
to
the
invisible
friends
who
are
around
you
All
be
quiet
a
moment
and
your
eyes
will
open
to
undreamed
of
things
Sp
Do
you
think
my
wife
can
get
help
She
was
as
pure
as
a
lily
I
loved
her
Dr
You
can
love
her
still
We
must
all
try
to
find
ourselves
As
we
grow
out
of
our
ignorance
we
see
the
higher
things
of
existence
both
here
and
in
the
spirit
life
If
we
were
born
into
a
perfect
condition
we
would
not
appreciate
it
You
have
seen
hell
and
when
you
progress
you
will
see
heaven
You
will
find
a
beautiful
condition
and
you
will
appreciate
it
You
will
then
be
enthusiastic
helpers
eager
to
serve
others
You
must
all
open
your
hearts
for
higher
things
Sp
I
love
my
wife
To
the
invisibles
No
boys
don
t
go
yet
wait
a
little
while
longer
Dr
The
Bible
says
Ask

it
shall
be
given

find
knock

be
opened

With
heartfelt

is

my
poor
wife
We
loved
each

Oh
God
Help
us

We
are
starving
for
something

His
messengers
will
help
you
You
will
see
many

will
gladly
help

If

There
s
my
boy
my
own
little
boy

You
are

You
died
many
years
ago
but
you
are
my
boy
Charlie
Have
you
come
to
help
your
old
Dad
my
boy
Your
poor
Dad
has
suffered
hell
my

Help
your
mother

help
your
mother
poor

Suddenly
amazed
Why
that
s
my
little
boy
Charlie
but
he
s
a
man
now
Charlie
my
little
boy
can
you
forgive
your
old
Dad
I
tried
so
hard
to
have
faith
and
I
tried
to
be
good
If
there
is
a
God
open
my
eyes
to
see
God
help
me
Gazing
at
some
vision
then
speaking
in
a
hushed
voice
Now
we
can
all
see
the
glory
of
God
and
we
will
all
go
with
Charlie

You
Are

here

Clara
Come
to
me
oh
Clara
I
forgive
you
I
forgive
you
Clara
I
know
it
was
not
your
fault
It
was
that
devil
he
took
you
away
from
me
I
love
you

always
have
loved
you
Come
Clara
come
with
us
and
let
us
go
with
Charlie
He
will
probably
forgive
you
Dr
What
does
he
say
Sp
He
says
Come
with
me
to
my
spirit
home
where
all
is
lovely
where
you
will
be
happy
It
was
because
of
sorrow
and
suffering
that
you
looked
at
life
as
you
did
Dr
Don
t
you
realize
there
is
something
beautiful
ahead
of
you

Is
it
Heaven
Why
look
there
There
s
my
mother

Emma
Are
you
both
here
too
Can
you
forgive
Clara
and
me
I
thought
you
were
in
Heaven

you
were
so
good
You
always
loved
me
Dr
Do
you
realize
now
that
there
is
something
higher
than
your
past

Yes
Now
I
know
there
is
a
God
I
do
believe
in
God
now
for
I
know
His
glory
I
see
and
feel
His
glory

After
you
have
understanding

must
help
the
others

were
talking
about

They
are
all
coming
with
me
I
want
them
all
to
come
for
I
cannot
leave
them
You
have
helped
all
of
us
Now
we
will
go
come
on
boys
We
had
names
for
each
other
but
they
were
not
our
own
In
our
hatred
and
because
we
laughed
we
were
called
The
Laughing
Fools
Most
of
our
time
was
spent
in
talking
over
our
past
Now
we
have
all
found
God
we
have
found
Him
in
His
glory
in
His
happiness
in
the

We
do
not
need
to
believe

we
know
He
will
help
us
all
Mother
father

all
are

Come
on
now
boys
We
all
listened
to
what
this
man
said

you
see
where
it
brought
us
Today
I
call
you
our
savior
because
you
have
saved
us
from
darkness
and
brought
us
to
glory
You
saved
us
all
Not
only
myself
but
the
others
have
opened
their
eyes
to
see
the
glory
of
God
and
not
a
God
of
hatred
and
envy

You
can
thank
my
wife

allows
her
body

be
used

helped

Goodbye
A
communication
of
a
different
type
was
received
from
the
spirit
of
a
young
man
son
of
one
of
the
members
of
our
circle
The
young
man
had
passed
over
two
months
before
but
having
been
unbiased
and
open
minded
was
readily
enlightened
by
his
spirit
friends
In
his
short
visit
to
our
circle
he
gave
an
interesting
description
of
conditions
as
he
observed
them
in
both
the
earth
sphere
and
the
spirit
world

Well
Dad
I
m
here
again
The
spirit
friends
gave
me
the
privilege
of
coming
and
talking
first
Dad
it
s
queer
that
I
should
go
so
quickly
but
my
time
had
come
I
am
glad
the
door
is
not
shut
for
me
I
have
seen
many
heartbroken
spirits
who
go
to
their
relatives
and
friends
and
the
door
is
closed
in
their
faces
Through
skepticism
and
unconsciousness
of
the
presence
of
spirits
I
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
because
it
s
hard
for
them
Grandpa
B
and
Uncle
C
stood
right
beside
me
when
I
woke
up
from
the
sleep
of
death
It
was
queer
It
was
like
an
electric
shock
going
through
my
body
Life
is
queer
If
each
one
of
you
could
see
the
experiences
gone
through
by
those
who
go
into
the
sleep
of
death
Dad
I
had
a
little
knowledge
of
the
next
life
not
much
but
a
little
and
it
helped
I
could
realize
that
the
change
of
death
had
taken
place
I
recognized
my
relatives
and
friends
Uncle
F
says
I
should
tell
you
that
I
was
much
better
off
than
he
was
when
he
passed
to
the
other
side
and
that
now
his
work
is
to
help
the
unfortunate
ones
who
do
not
understand
the
real
life
Dad
wasn
t
it
queer
that
I
should
wake
up
to
the
new
birth

my

Dad
it
s
glorious
Tell
E

B

tell
all
of
them
that
I
am
happy
in
the
thought
that
I
can
come
to
them
and
that
the
door
is
not
closed
to
me
Tell
my
little
son
that
I
am
not
dead
that
I
am
not
in
the
grave
but
am
with
him
and
I
will
learn
the
laws
governing
so
that
I
can
guide
him
through
life
Let
him
have
an
understanding
that
I
am
there
with
him
and
that
I
have
more
strength
and
power
to
help
him
than
before
Thank
God
that
I
also
had
understanding
so
that
I
did
not
come
too
close
to
my
dear
wife
otherwise
I
would
have
gotten
into
her
magnetic
aura
and
might
have
caused
trouble
My
dear
little
wife
I
am
glad
that
I
did
not
make
trouble
for
us
both
I
have
seen
much
of
the
work
done
among
those
who
have
passed
out
and
do
not
realize
it
They
go
home
to
their
relatives
and
friends
and
want
to
stay
there
rather
than
go
on
Dad
I
m
so
glad
you
could
come
here
again

I
m
glad
so
glad
that
there
is

us
Mr

Father

am
glad
too
that
I
had
an
opportunity
of
being
here
again
Sp
I
feel
now
that
there
is
no
parting
It
is
only
that
I
have
gone
to
another
country
but
I
am
with
you
all
I
am
with
you
when
you
are
all
together
and
talk
about
me
I
do
not
feel
that
I
have
gone
Tell
mother
and
my
dear
little
wife
not
to
mourn
for
me
but
to
feel
glad
that
I
can
be
with
them
It
was
very
hard
that
we
should
have
to
part
when
everything
looked
so
bright
for
us
in
our
little
home
but
it
was
my
time
to
go
and
when
our
time
comes
to
go
from
this
earth
life
we
have
to
go
We
do
not
go
away
as
people
think
we
do
we
are
here
with
our
loved
ones
only
our
bodies
are
not
visible
I
wish
you
could
see
how
Uncle
F
works
in
the
dark
earth
sphere
to
help
and
to
serve
the
unfortunate
ones
there
to
prevent
them
from
obsessing
any
one
He
is
so
anxious
to
have
everybody
know
the
real
truth
on
the
other
side
and
it
is
a
pity
that
so
much
dogma
and
creed
are
the
stumblingblocks
The
little
time
I
have
been
gone
I
have
learned
so
much
I
thank
you
Dad
that
you
and
mother
did
not
force
any
strong
dogma
or
religion
or
creed
upon
my
mind
I
was
free
Thank
you
for
it
Mr
Y
It
s
pretty
hard
sometimes
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
regarding
religion
in
bringing
up
children
Sp
I
wish
all
could
have
been
as
free
as
I
was
then
there
would
not
be
so
much
sorrow
and
doubt
Dad
I
m
so
glad
I
can
come
to
you
again
The
other
day
Uncle
F
Uncle
C
and
I
went
to
the
earth
sphere
not
to
our
home
but
to
the
condition
that
exists
on
the
lower
plane
That
is
more
of
a
hell
than
anybody
can
describe
It
s
worse
than
an
insane
asylum
where
one
is
crazy
in
one
way
and
another
in
another
way
You
can
t
imagine
what
a
hell
it
is
One
has
one
creed
one
another
and
they
are
all
in
the
dark
They
are
all
hypnotized
in
their
creeds
and
beliefs
and
you
can
not
get
any
sense
whatever
into
them
You
have
to
put
some
object
lesson
before
them
to
attract
their
attention
At
times
music
will
make
them
realize
their
condition
If
you
can
attract
their
attention
you
can
sometimes
reach
the
real
spirit
but
dogmas
and
creeds
are
so
planted
in
their
minds
that
they
cannot
see
anything
If
you
want
to
realize
in
part
what
the
condition
of
the
earth
sphere
is
go
to
the
worst
ward
in
an
insane
asylum
and
you
can
then
have
some
realization
of
the
condition
on
the
invisible
side
when
they
have
no
knowledge
of
the
next
life
Imagine
a
spirit
of
that
character
coming
in
contact
with
a
person
s
magnetic
aura
and
acting
through
him
as
is
often
the
case
They
call
that
person
insane
and
send
him
to
the
insane
asylum
where
there
are
a
lot
of
other
lunatics
both
of
earth
and
the
spirit
side
of
life
It
is
terrible
to
know
that
such
a
condition
exists
and
that
selfish
creeds
And
dogmas
are
the
cause
of
it
all
I
have
to
thank
you
and
mother
again
for
not
forcing
any
dogma
on
me
what
little
knowledge
I
had
was
the
real
truth
of
life
Uncle
C
took
me
at
another
time
to
different
conditions
He
said
Come
we
will
go
and
we
went
to
some
place
in
spirit
life
We
came
to
a
place
which
I
cannot
describe
I
can
t
describe
my
feelings
I
can
t
describe
the
conditions
because
the
music
was
so
sublime
so
different
from
anything
I
have
ever
heard
I
felt
so
light
I
felt
I
was
lifted
up
Such
people
as
were
there
I
cannot
describe
them
Imagine
if
you
can
a
place
where
there
is
the
most
beautiful
music
where
there
is
a
grand
orchestra
of
masters
all
playing
in
one
grand
unit
of
music
Can
you
imagine
what
it
would
be
I
enjoyed
it
but
Oh
I
could
not
realize
its
full
import
because
I
wanted
you
and
my
dear
little
wife
to
hear
it
I
could
not
enjoy
it
alone
I
wanted
to
open
the
door
to
you
all
at
home
so
that
you
could
all
listen
to
it
then
I
should
have
felt
satisfied
I
thought
and
thought
and
an
old
gentleman
came
up
to
me
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
Young
man
I
receive
your
thought
Do
not
worry
Soon
the
time
will
come
for
which
we
are
all
working
when
an
instrument
will
be
invented
on
earth
through
which
all
who
wish
can
hear
the
grand
masters
in
the
spirit
world
Not
yet
but
in
time
Dad
my
work
is
to
learn
to
help
others
less
fortunate
than
myself
and
also
to
learn
to
be
a
help
and
not
a
detriment
to
my
dear
wife
and
little
boy
and
to
you
all
I
am
learning
my
lessons
and
after
knowing
them
I
will
come
to
you
Don
t
think
I
am
not
with
you
all
but
think
I
am
there
for
I
am
and
in
that
way
I
can
be
much
closer
especially
when
you
have
music
because
music
brings
us
much
closer
to
those
we
love
Goodbye
and
tell
my
dear
wife
I
send
her
best
love
With
exquisite
grace
and
courteous
inquiry
came
the
spirit
of
one
formerly
a
famous
actress
whose
friends
had
tried
in
vain
to
waken
her
from
the
sleep
of
death

MRS
WICKLAND
Doctor
Good
Evening
friend
Where
have
you
come
from
Spirit
Somebody
told
me
to
come
here
but
I
do
not
know
what
I
should
do
My
condition
is
so
strange
that
I
cannot
understand
it
I
do
not
realize
where
I
am
Dr
You
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
No
There
are
many
here
who
wanted
me
to
come
but
I
cannot
understand
why
I
do
not
know
any
of
you
here
Dr
You
were
brought
here
to
be
helped
Sp
I
do
not
know
that
I
need
any
help
Things
look
so
confusing
to
me
Dr
That
is
because
you
do
not
understand
your
condition
Where
do
you
think
you
should
be
Sp
Where
my
home
is
Dr
What
state
did
you
live
in
Sp
Of
course
most
of
the
time
I
was
in
New
York
but
at
times
I
was
in
London
and
other
places
Dr
Cannot
you
see
any
one
you
know
or
the
one
who
brought
you
here
Sp
Oh
Disturbed
greatly
by
pain
in
limb
Dr
Were
you
in
some
accident
Were
you
traveling
What
is
the
last
thing
you
remember
Sp
I
was
very
sick
I
had
such
pain
Dr
Probably
that
was
your
last
illness
Did
you
become
well
suddenly
Sp
No
it
seems
to
me
that
I
have
been
sleeping
and
in
some
way
or
another
I
am
just
waking
up
Everything
looks
so
queer
Dr
You
do
not
understand
your
condition
You
do
not
need
to
have
that
pain
If
you
say
I
will
not
have
that
pain
it
will
disappear
Will
you
do
that
Sp
Yes
but
it
seems
very
hard
to
say
You
are
a
Christian
Scientist
are
you
not
I
looked
into
Christian
Science
but
I
certainly
could
not
say
my
pains
were
imagination
Dr
You
are
in
a
different
condition
now
Do
you
ever
see
any
of
your
friends
around
you
Sp
Yes
I
sometimes
see
many
of
my
particular
friends
that
have
gone
before
and
then
I
think
to
myself
that
I
have
gone
crazy
My
friends
are
around
me
and
some
one
says
Wake
up
But
I
cannot
see
I
do
not
want
to
see
them
Dr
That
is
because
you
do
not
want
to
understand
Were
you
afraid
of
them
when
they
were
living
Sp
No
I
was
not
Dr
Then
why
should
you
be
afraid
of
them
when
they
have
lost
their
mortal
bodies
Sp
I
am
afraid
and
very
nervous
and
I
do
not
want
them
to
come
near
me
Why
don
t
my
lovely
friends
come
Dr
To
your
earthly
friends
you
are
dead
but
to
your
spirit
friends
you
are
not
dead
Sp
I
was
sick
but
I
cannot
remember
that
I
died
I
went
to
sleep
but
I
cannot
remember
that
I
failed
to
wake
up
Several
of
my
friends
just
came
and
called
me
to
go
with
them
Dr
Do
you
know
why
they
told
you
to
wake
up
To
your
spirit
friends
you
are
only
sleeping
Sp
Why
do
they
call
me
Dr
To
help
you
and
make
you
understand
Sp
I
do
not
know
you
Dr
I
am
Dr
Wickland
Who
brought
you
here
Sp
Anna
H
an
actress
well
known
to
the
spirit
during
earth
life
told
me
to
come
Dr
She
spoke
to
us
once
as
you
are
doing
now
Sp
She
came
to
me
but
I
knew
she
was
dead
and
gone
Dr
She
is
not
dead
We
do
not
see
you
we
only
hear
you
talk
You
do
not
see
me
you
only
see
my
body
Mind
is
invisible
there
is
no
death
See
Chap

Anna

Sp
So
many
people
have
come
to
me
and
want
me
to
wake
up
and
start
in
my
work
again
Dr
If
you
do
not
mind
telling
us
we
should
like
to
know
who
you
are
Sp
Don
t
you
know
me
I
was
an
actress
I
was
known
as
Lillian
R
I
am
not
dead
William
Stead
came
to
me
and
also
the
late
King
Edward
I
was
his
favorite
actress
I
cannot
understand
why
I
came
here
They
say
I
was
brought
here
for
you
to
awaken
me
Dr
We
are
interested
in
life
s
problems
and
in
the
question
What
becomes
of
the
Dead
Sp
I
studied
some
but
only
understood
slightly
the
phenomena
I
studied
but
at
the
same
time
my
life
was
so
busy
so
much
taken
up
with
others
and
I
was
also
trying
to
live
the
best
I
knew
how
I
am
very
tired
and
sleepy
Dr
What
was
the
nature
of
your
sickness
Sp
They
told
me
so
many
different
things
until
at
last
I
do
not
know
what
it
was
I
had
such
dreadful
pains
down
this
way
from
the
knee
down
I
was
unconscious
for
a
time
I
cannot
remember
things
very
clearly
in
some
way
I
seem
to
have
lost
my
memory
I
cannot
recollect
anything
of
the
past
I
feel
different
as
if
I
had
nothing
to
look
forward
to
in
the
future
I
am
not
unhappy
but
at
the
same
time
I
am
not
happy
Dr
We
will
explain
matters
to
you
You
do
not
need
to
worry
Sp
My
friends
came
and
I
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
them
They
said
Come
along
but
I
said
No
no
no
I
am
not
ready
yet
I
do
not
want
to
go
Dr
You
had
already
gone
but
did
not
understand
it
Your
friends
came
to
help
you
but
you
did
not
understand
it
Do
you
know
where
you
are
now
This
is
my
wife

body

are
using

is
sleeping

are
not

A
is
here
Dr
This
lady
is
a
psychic
She
is
my
wife
and
allows
spirits
to
control
her
so
that
we
can
make
them
understand
their
condition
Mr
John
J
A
Mr
Stead
and
Anna

could
not
make
you

I
was
afraid

them
Dr
This
is
a
Clearing
House

just
such
conditions
as
yours

are
a

are
controlling
a
mortal
body
We
See
Chap
Page
Spirit
John
J
A
on
the
mortal
side
can
talk
to
you
because
we
are
in
our
mortal
bodies
You
have
lost
your
physical
body
but
have
a
spiritual
body
When
you
passed
away
you
only
went
to
sleep
and
you
are
just
now
waking
up
You
awaken
and
find
yourself
in
this
twilight
Sp
Someone
seemed
to
give
me
an
electric
shock
and
I
seemed
to
come
to
life
but
still
I
am
dazed
There
is
a
room
full
of
faces
people
whom
I
have
known
in
life
but
who
have
passed
on
They
have
been
around
me
trying
to
talk
to
me
but
I
would
not
listen
Dr
That
was
your
mistake
Sp
Does
the
spirit
still
live
Dr
Certainly
it
does
We
are
mortals
but
these
others
whom
you
see
are
spirits
Sp
They
are
just
as
real
as
you
are
Dr
They
are
more
real
than
we
are
because
they
are
free
and
we
are
in
a
dream
state
Sp
I
feel
that
my
being
well
is
just
a
dream
and
that
I
will
wake
up
in
pain
Dr
When
you
leave
here
you
will
go
with
the
others
Sp
Do
you
mean
I
can
go
with
them
Dr
As
soon
as
you
cease
to
resist
them
Sp
Here
comes
one
then
another
and
they
say
they
want
me
Dr
Don
t
you
remember
that
Longfellow
said
Life
is
real
Life
is
earnest
And
the
grave
is
not
its
goal
Dust
thou
art
to
dust
returnest
Was
not
spoken
of
the
soul
Sp
What
beautiful
things
I
see
Are
they
not
beautiful
This
is
not
a
dream
Dr
They
are
showing
you
some
of
the
things
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
Sp
Just
look
at
those
beautiful
homes
on
that
hillside
Look
at
those
lovely
walks
beautiful
lakes
and
hills
lovely
flowers
that
bloom
everywhere
Isn
t
it
beautiful
Can
I
go
there
Dr
There
is
nothing
to
hinder
you
except
your
own
unwillingness
and
resistance
Sp
I
was
an
actress
in
life
still
in
my
heart
I
believed
in
a
God
You
know
the
church
always
looks
down
on
actresses
I
always
liked
to
give
the
world
the
best
there
was
in
me
I
wanted
to
show
what
we
can
do
to
help
amuse
people
Dr
You
can
do
the
same
thing
now
in
your
new
life
Sp
In
a
way
many
would
say
that
I
was
not
a
Christian
In
my
own
way
I
believed
in
being
good
and
doing
good
for
others
that
was
my
belief
At
times
I
went
to
church
but
at
times
I
did
not
feel
at
home
in
that
atmosphere
I
always
tried
to
do
my
best
Dr
The
reason
you
did
not
feel
at
home
in
church
was
because
the
spirit
of
truth
was
not
there
Sp
Look
at
the
lights
Are
they
not
beautiful
they
are
singing
and
vibrating
into
different
shades
and
tunes
The
colorings
are
wonderful
I
will
try
to
do
there
what
I
could
not
do
here
I
should
many
times
have
liked
to
give
the
world
more
than
good
and
happy
thoughts
I
knew
at
times
that
life
must
have
a
greater
purpose
than
is
generally
realized
I
was
true
to
myself
in
my
own
heart
Such
beautiful
things
I
can
see
Is
that
Heaven
Dr
Yes
but
not
the
Christian
Heaven
Not
the
Heaven
of
Salvation
but
the
spirit
world
surrounding
the
earth
world
Jesus
taught
the
existence
of
spirits
and
a
spirit
world
and
Paul
says
There
is
a
natural
body
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body
first
that
which
is
natural
and
afterward
that
which
is
spiritual
Sp
Anna
H
says
she
is
different
now
from
what
she
was
when
I
knew
her
She
says
I
do
not
know
her
now
She
is
serving
and
helping
the
unfortunate
ones
She
says
she
wanted
to
do
what
she
could
to
wake
me
up
May
I
ask
what
you
are
doing
here
Dr
This
is
an
Institution
for
research
and
the
obtaining
of
knowledge
concerning
what
becomes
of
the
dead
This
is
also
a
Spiritual
Clearing
House
This
lady
you
are
controlling
is
my
wife
she
is
a
psychic
intermediary
and
you
are
allowed
to
use
her
body
and
brain
to
convince
you
of
your
present
condition
You
are
using
a
body
not
your
own
Raising
Mrs
Wickland
s
hand
This
is
not
your
hand
Sp
No
it
is
not
It
is
queer
Dr
The
queer
part
is
the
human
ignorance
on
these
points
Sp
The
church
does
not
teach
these
things
Dr
The
church
limits
itself
to
faith
alone
and
does
not
desire
to
add
the
required
knowledge
regarding
the
natural
continuation
of
the
spirit
after
death
The
Bible
says
that
to
our
faith
we
must
add
knowledge
and
Jesus
taught
Know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
If
you
had
understood
these
truths
you
would
have
accepted
the
spirit
friends
who
came
to
you
when
you
awakened
Sp
It
is
all
so
beautiful
that
I
should
like
to
go
with
them
They
say
that
when
I
am
stronger
I
shall
finish
my
work
over
there
How
will
they
take
care
of
me
I
am
very
weak
Dr
You
will
not
be
so
weak
when
you
leave
this
body
As
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
You
will
be
received
with
love
and
taken
to
a
beautiful
home
You
will
be
so
overjoyed
with
your
new
condition
that
you
will
not
have
time
to
be
weak
Sp
Will
I
not
go
into
a
sleep
again
Dr
When
you
were
sick
and
in
great
pain
you
were
probably
given
opiates
and
they
may
have
had
a
stupifying
effect
Sp
Thank
you
Now
they
are
calling
me
and
I
feel
that
I
want
to
go
I
feel
such
gratitude
to
you
for
helping
me
and
for
being
the
means
of
my
understanding
and
also
for
helping
me
to
reach
my
friends
so
that
I
may
know
how
to
go
to
them
instead
of
shutting
the
door
against
them
and
leaving
myself
in
the
dark
I
thank
you
all
that
I
had
the
opportunity
of
being
awakened
to
such
a
beautiful
condition
as
I
now
see
I
was
only
in
the
darkness
of
my
own
consciousness
They
call
me
and
keep
on
calling
me
and
they
all
say
they
are
glad
to
invite
me
to
their
home
in
the
spirit
world
There
is
one
thing
they
want
me
to
say
but
I
do
not
know
whether
I
am
strong
enough
One
gentleman
says
I
was
King
Edward
in
life
but
I
am
an
ordinary
person
now
I
wanted
to
wake
you
up
because
I
have
been
awakened
from
the
life
I
led
My
mother
was
a
Queen
but
she
is
a
Queen
no
longer
She
has
to
serve
others
more
than
she
did
when
she
was
on
earth
My
mother
knew
of
spirit
phenomena
and
she
also
knew
of
spirit
return
but
she
did
not
know
what
her
duty
was
and
she
was
waited
on
all
her
life
She
was
never
allowed
to
do
anything
or
have
any
real
responsibility
She
serves
here
and
there
Now
I
have
to
serve
and
help
until
I
understand
the
real
life
This
gentleman
says
that
is
the
message
he
wished
to
send
He
came
to
say
this
because
you
probably
thought
he
was
still
a
King
He
is
here
only
as
a
man
He
wants
to
help
you
as
the
others
are
doing
He
is
not
of
noble
or
royal
blood
any
more
All
my
friends
have
come
to
shake
hands
and
they
all
seem
to
be
one
family
I
want
to
say
Good
Night
but
how
will
I
go
Dr
Thought
is
the
solver
of
Nature
s
problems
Think
of
your
friends
over
there
and
you
will
be
with
them
You
will
have
to
fix
your
mind
from
here
to
there
Think
I
am
actually
there
Sp
I
certainly
want
to
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
of
coming
here
and
for
awakening
me
so
that
I
can
be
with
my
friends
over
there
The
organism
of
every
human
being
generates
a
nervous
force
and
magnetism
which
surrounds
him
with
an
atmosphere
of
vital
emanations
and
psychic
light
known
as
the
Magnetic
Aura
This
aura
is
visible
as
a
light
to
earthbound
spirits
in
their
condition
of
darkness
and
they
may
become
attracted
to
persons
peculiarly
susceptible
to
their
encroachment
Such
spirits
are
often
unable
to
leave
this
psychic
atmosphere
and
in
the
resulting
state
of
confusion
confusional
psychosis
although
struggling
for
freedom
they
find
themselves
living
the
life
of
the
psychic
with
him
resenting
his
presence
and
bewildered
by
a
sense
of
dual
personality
After
a
number
of
spirits
had
been
taken
from
a
patient
who
was
very
unmanageable
at
first
we
had
the
following
experience
which
clearly
shows
the
suffering
that
spirits
may
endure
when
enmeshed
in
the
aura
of
a
mortal

Doctor
Tell
us
who
you
are
We
are
interested
in
all
spirits
who
are
in
darkness
Tell
us
how
long
you
have
been
dead
Spirit
I
guess
something
happened
to
me
Dr
Do
you
realize
that
you
have
passed
out
of
your
own
body
Sp
I
don
t
want
my
hands
held
I
am
a
lady
of
means
an
expression
often
used
by
the
patient
and
want
to
be
shown
the
courtesies
and
respect
due
a
lady
Dr
Did
they
call
you
Mrs
or
Miss
Sp
I
am
a
lady
of
means
and
I
am
not
used
to
this
kind
of
questioning
I
just
feel
like
giving
you
a
piece
of
my
mind
Dr
What
seems
to
be
your
trouble
Sp
You
it
seems
have
such
a
way
of
giving
me
all
kinds
Of
strange
things
in
my
back
static
treatment
of
patient
and
cannot
see
why
you
should
do
so
You
have
also
kept
me
in
prison
It
must
have
been
you
that
put
me
in
prison
Who
are
you
anyway
Dr
I
am
a
friend
and
I
want
to
talk
to
you
Sp
In
the
first
place
I
don
t
know
you
and
in
the
second
place
I
have
nothing
to
talk
to
you
about
Who
are
you
Tell
me
your
name
Dr
I
am
Dr
Wickland
Sp
I
really
didn
t
mean
to
ask
your
name
for
I
m
not
at
all
interested
to
know
it
Dr
Wouldn
t
you
like
to
go
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
Sp
I
do
not
like
to
hear
about
such
things
I
am
no
spirit
Dr
Look
at
your
hands
do
they
belong
to
you
Sp
You
are
the
means
of
my
having
been
kept
in
prison
so
long
and
now
you
are
trying
to
show
me
things
that
are
not
true
and
so
I
will
not
listen
to
you
Dr
How
did
you
happen
to
come
here
Sp
I
do
not
know
myself
It
is
very
curious
I
seemed
to
be
in
prison
and
before
I
knew
anything
I
was
here
I
do
not
see
how
I
came
There
were
a
whole
lot
of
us
and
somehow
I
have
been
left
alone
I
have
been
in
prison
but
I
do
not
know
what
I
have
done
Dr
Where
were
you
when
you
had
those
others
with
you
Where
were
you
staying
Referring
to
obsessing
spirits
in
patient
s
aura
Sp
I
was
staying
where
I
belonged
There
were
a
lot
of
us
all
bunched
together
men
and
women
We
had
a
home
but
we
could
not
get
out
of
it
Sometimes
we
were
in
warm
quarters
For
a
time
I
have
been
by
myself
and
I
have
been
in
a
dark
place
Before
I
was
in
prison
we
could
talk
one
at
a
time
control
the
patient
but
now
I
am
all
alone
You
have
no
right
to
put
all
those
burning
things
on
me
Dr
That
kind
of
electrical
treatment
is
very
good
for
earthbound
spirits
ignorant
ones
Sp
Ignorant
How
dare
you
talk
like
that
to
me
How
dare
you
Dr
Don
t
you
know
that
you
have
passed
out
of
your
mortal
body
You
have
lost
your
physical
body
Sp
How
do
you
know
I
have
Dr
Because
the
body
you
are
talking
through
is
not
your
own
It
is
my
wife
s
body
Sp
I
never
saw
you
before
you
put
those
sharp
things
in
me
Dr
You
were
not
using
this
body
at
that
time
Sp
What
does
it
all
mean
Dr
It
means
that
you
have
been
using
another
person
s
body
Sp
Well
that
explains
many
things
in
a
way
Sometimes
I
felt
that
I
did
not
belong
where
I
was
then
once
in
a
while
I
felt
I
was
myself
again
There
was
one
big
old
man
a
big
fool
but
we
had
to
do
just
as
he
said
Another
spirit
obsessing
patient
previously
removed
I
did
not
feel
like
doing
as
he
said
because
I
had
all
the
money
I
wanted
so
why
should
I
bother
with
such
a
rascal
I
felt
I
had
to
do
what
he
said
and
yet
I
could
not
see
why
I
should
I
was
not
in
my
own
home
and
yet
I
had
to
be
there
and
I
never
could
understand
why
I
could
not
get
away
He
kept
several
of
us
with
him
Dr
Did
the
electricity
help
you
to
get
away
Sp
Yes
it
did
but
it
hurt
like
fury
It
seems
as
if
it
tore
the
life
out
of
me
Dr
The
electricity
liberated
you
just
the
same
Sp
We
could
not
get
away
from
that
man
We
had
to
do
as
he
said
He
ran
and
ran
all
the
time
the
patient
often
ran
away
and
we
had
to
do
the
same
There
was
a
little
girl
and
she
cried
all
the
time
Obsessing
spirit
previously
dislodged
from
same
patient
At
times
I
was
free
and
at
times
I
was
in
such
misery
Some
times
I
felt
I
could
float
from
one
place
to
another
Dr
At
such
times
you
were
a
free
spirit
SP
Don
t
say
that
word
How
I
do
hate
it
I
do
not
have
any
use
for
anything
of
that
kind
Dr
You
do
not
recognize
the
fact
that
when
you
pass
out
of
the
mortal
body
you
do
not
die
but
that
you
live
you
then
become
a
spirit
Sp
You
know
I
am
not
dead
Cannot
you
understand
that
I
am
talking
to
you
and
that
I
can
move
my
hands
and
arms
Dr
My
friend
while
you
are
talking
we
cannot
see
you
We
can
only
see
my
wife
You
are
talking
through
my

body

is
Mrs

your

I

my

years

Dr
Do
you

California
Sp
I
have
never
been
there
I
went
first
to
Chicago

from
there
to
St

also
lived

I
was
traveling
I
did
not

there
I
did
once
live
on
La
Salle
Avenue
Chicago
but
I
was
there
for
a
little
while
only
It
was
near
La
Salle

Division
From
there
I
went
to
St

from
there
well
I
really
don
t
know
where
I
went
I
do
know
that
my
head
was
bothering
me
a
great
deal
Patient
complained
similarly
Dr
Do
you
remember
being
sick
Sp
I
cannot
recall
much
of
anything
Suddenly
greatly
excited
No
No

There

you
My

I

Understand

lost
your
physical

to
realize
this

Please
explain
why
Hugo

Lily
are
around
me
Are
they
not
happy
in
Heaven
Why
don
t
they
stay
there
Dr
Do
you
know
anything
about
Heaven
Sp
Heaven
is
above
where
Christ
and
God
are
Dr
Jesus
said
The
Kingdom
of
God
is
within

The
Bible
says
Ye

dwelleth

God
is
Love

that
dwelleth

Sp
Don
t
you
believe
in
a
personal
God
Dr
God
is
Spirit
God
could
not
be
only
in
one
place
Sp
I
am
getting
so
tired
that
it
is
hard
for
me
to
understand
what
you
say
If
there
were
only
a
place
where
I
could
rest
I
would
gladly
go
I
cannot
describe
to
you
what
misery
I
have
been
in
I
have
no
home
anywhere
that
I
can
go
to
no
place
to
rest
my
weary
head
I
went
from
one
place
to
another
and
I
could
not
find
home
or
peace
I
have
prayed
that
I
might
find
rest
for
just
a
little
while
but
somebody
always
comes
and
disturbs
me
There
were
so
many
around
each
crowding
the
other
and
I
probably
was
mean
myself
but
I
could
not
help
it
I
felt
as
if
a
wild
beast
had
gotten
hold
of
me
and
I
fought
everybody
like
a
tiger
and
when
I
was
through
I
was
weak
for
days
and
days
I
suffered
terribly
That
horrible
man
was
always
after
us
and
that
poor
little
child
was
crying
all
the
time
she
was
so
crowded
I
wish
I
had
a
little
home
of
my
own
where
I
could
go
and
not
have
that
man
around
me
again
He
was
terrible
you
have
no
idea
He
was
such
a
rascal
but
he
went
away
and
we
have
not
seen
him
for
quite
a
while
The
little
girl
who
cried
so
much
has
also
gone
She
always
had
trouble
with
her
head
I
did
not
mean
to
be
a
bad
woman
but
that
man
tormented
us
all
so
much
that
we
did
not
know
what
to
do
Dr
Wouldn
t
you
like
to
go
with
your
husband
and
mother
and
little
girl
and
have
them
all
take
care
of
you
so
that
you
can
rest
Try
to
realize
that
you
have
lost
your
physical
body
Sp
When
did
I
lose
my
body
Dr
We
cannot
tell
you
that
Sp
Sometimes
I
have
felt
I
was
a
big
woman
and
I
could
fight
everybody
and
then
I
would
seem
smaller
and
it
was
very
confusing
Dr
That
may
have
been
caused
by
your
influencing
different
people
You
can
be
free
from
that
condition
Sp
Then
will
I
have
a
rest
Will
I
wake
up
and
find
that
I
have
only
had
a
dream
and
then
have
that
horrible
man
and
that
crying
child
around
me
I
do
not
want
to
ever
see
that
man
again
He
used
to
fight
those
women
as
if
he
were
a
demon
and
he
was
so
angry
and
he
treated
the
little
girl
very
badly
She
was
afraid
of
him
Dr
Now
try
to
forget
what
has
happened
and
live
for
the
future
Go
with
your
husband
and
he
will
explain
the
beauties
of
the
spirit
world
to
you
Sp
My
husband
Hugo
I
love
him
so
dearly
and
after
he
died
life
was
not
worth
living
to
me
My
dear
child
went
to
him
just
a
month
afterward
She
was
a
child
three
years
of
age
Hugo
my
husband
was
my
life
I
did
not
care
what
became
of
me
after
he
left
When
my
husband
lived
we
traveled
a
great
deal
We
went
everywhere
We
went
to
Alaska
and
there
he
took
cold
and
had
pneumonia
and
my
little
child
got
very
sick
It
is
hard
to
live
all
that
over
again
Dr
Why
go
all
over
that
again
when
your
people
are
here
to
take
you
away
with
them
Sp
I
want
to
go
with
them
but
I
am
afraid
because
they
are
dead
Hugo
says
he
has
been
looking
for
me
for
years
and
years
but
he
could
not
find
me
and
I
cannot
tell
him
where
I
have
been
When
Hugo
and
Lily
died
I
took
very
sick
and
the
doctors
said
I
was
a
nervous
wreck
I
grew
very
much
worse
and
I
remember
them
taking
me
to
a
place
called
Elgin
probably
an
asylum
I
have
just
a
faint
recollection
of
that
When
I
grew
better
evidently
died
I
went
to
St
Louis
because
I
had
a
sister
there
Since
I
began
to
talk
I
feel
different
and
now
I
want
to
go
with
all
my
people
Just
look
at
that
beautiful
bed
Now
I
can
rest
and
with
Hugo
I
shall
not
have
worries
any
more
God
bless
you
all
and
help
you
Hugo
says
to
tell
you
he
is
so
pleased
he
found
me
at
last
and
to
say
we
shall
be
reunited
and
never
part
again
God
bless
you
each
and
all
CHAPTER
V
Tormenting
Spirits
Marriage
Disturbances
OBSESSING
SPIRITS
may
purposely
torment
helpless
sensitives
sometimes
for
revenge
but
more
often
with
a
desire
to
punish
the
latter
who
they
declare
are
interfering
with
them
These
tormenting
spirits
frequently
cause
their
victims
to
commit
deeds
of
violence
upon
themselves
and
do
not
seem
to
suffer
from
pain
which
they
inflict
upon
the
physical
body
of
the
sensitive
yet
contradictory
as
it
may
seem
many
labor
under
the
delusion
that
the
body
of
the
mortal
is
their
own
After
the
death
of
her
husband
Mrs
L
W
developed
a
melancholia
which
was
followed
by
hallucinations
of
hearing
and
constantly
tormented
by
hearing
the
voices
of
spirits
she
often
dashed
madly
out
of
the
house
screaming
and
pulling
out
her
hair
At
such
times
her
daughter
who
was
clairvoyant
saw
spirits
about
her
mother
particularly
the
spirit
of
a
jeering
man
and
the
patient
herself
often
saw
this
man
saying
There
comes
that
terrible
man
again
The
patient
was
brought
from
St
Louis
to
Los
Angeles
in
the
belief
that
a
change
of
scene
and
climate
would
be
beneficial
but
the
violent
attacks
increased
in
these
seizures
she
bit
her
hands
and
arms
beat
her
face
with
a
slipper
and
tore
off
her
clothes
She
finally
became
uncontrollable
and
was
taken
to
the
Psychopathic
Ward
declared
insane
and
committed
to
a
sanitarium
where
she
remained
for
a
year
without
any
improvement
After
escaping
three
times
she
was
placed
in
our
care
and
within
a
few
months
the
tormenting
spirits
were
taken
away
the
lady
became
entirely
normal
has
since
remained
well
and
is
assisting
her
daughter
with
her
household
occupations
A
few
days
after
her
arrival
at
our
Institute
the
spirit
of
the
jeering
man
so
often
seen
by
the
patient
s
daughter
was
removed
and
allowed
to
control

MRS

The
spirit
struggled
furiously
for
a
time
and
restraint
was
required
Spirit
What
in
the
world
are
you
holding
me
for
I
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
you
folks
I
don
t
like
any
of
you
I
don
t
see
what
right
you
have
to
hold
me
I
never
did
you
any
harm
and
I
ll
make
it
pretty
hot
for
you
before
I
get
through
Doctor
You
came
to
us
as
a
stranger
and
at
once
started
fighting
What
else
could
I
do
but
hold
you
in
restraint
Sp
I
don
t
want
to
be
held
down
like
this
Dr
Who
are
you
Sp
Why
should
I
tell
you
who
I
am
I
don
t
know
any
of
you
and
I
don
t
care
who
you
are
Just
leave
me
alone
so
that
can
go
Dr
Tell
us
who
you
are
friend
You
seem
to
be
a
pretty
strong
girl
Sp
If
you
take
me
for
a
girl
you
had
better
look
again
Dr
Tell
us
where
you
came
from
and
what
you
want
Sp
What
do
you
want
to
know
for
Dr
Perhaps
we
can
help
you
out
of
your
present
condition
Sp
Don
t
hold
me
so
tight
then
I
will
talk
Dr
Tell
us
all
about
yourself
Sp
In
the
first
place
I
don
t
want
those
needles
referring
to
electrical
treatment
given
patient
put
on
me
Then
I
have
been
kept
a
prisoner
for
a
while
Now
I
m
out
I
feel
just
like
fighting
Freed
from
aura
of
patient
and
the
restraint
placed
upon
him
by
intelligent
spirits
What
in
the
world
did
you
put
all
those
needles
on
me
for
If
I
can
go
away
from
here
I
will
go
back
home
Dr
Where
is
your
home
Sp
My
home
is
where
I
came
from
Dr
I
am
curious
to
know
how
you
got
those
needles
on
your
back
Sp
It
was
just
like
I
was
on
fire
every
time
I
had
them
I
don
t
want
to
sit
here
and
be
held
down
and
I
m
going
Dr
How
did
you
happen
to
have
the
benefit
of
such
needles
I
am
very
curious
to
know
Sp
I
don
t
know
myself
but
I
got
them
Dr
How
did
you
happen
to
come
here
Sp
I
don
t
know
Dr
Did
you
come
here
with
somebody
you
were
attached
to
Sp
I
was
only
attached
to
myself
Dr
Where
have
you
been
recently
Sp
I
have
been
in
darkness
I
got
away
from
my
home
then
I
could
not
see
anything
It
seemed
as
if
I
was
blind
Dr
Were
you
not
in
a
strange
condition
when
you
were
in
that
place
you
call
home
Sp
It
wasn
t
my
real
home
but
it
was
just
like
it
Dr
Did
you
become
disgusted
sometimes
and
then
act
queerly
Sp
Sometimes
I
did
not
know
where
I
was
and
then
I
acted
up
all
the
time
Once
in
a
while
we
had
a
big
fight
There
were
several
people
around
but
I
will
get
them
some
day
Dr
Who
were
they
Sp
Why
I
don
t
know
all
kinds
of
people
Dr
Were
there
any
women
Sp
There
were
so
many
you
could
not
rest
Women
Some
day
I
am
going
to
get
hold
of
the
rest
of
them
and
shake
them
up
Dr
I
don
t
see
why
you
should
want
to
harm
others
Sp
One
woman
would
come
at
me
one
way
and
one
another
and
it
made
me
mad
but
what
can
a
fellow
do
when
he
has
a
whole
lot
of
women
around
Other
obsessing
spirits
in
patient
s
aura
Dr
Where
do
you
think
you
are
now
Sp
Where
I
don
t
care
where
I
am
Dr
Where
have
you
been
living
Sp
We
have
been
living
at
different
places
We
have
been
from
one
place
to
another
until
I
am
plumb
disgusted
with
everything
I
feel
like
running
away
so
nobody
can
find
me
Dr
You
could
not
get
away
from
yourself
Sp
I
have
had
nothing
but
women
around
me
women
women
until
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
women
I
got
one
woman
down
and
I
bit
and
kicked
and
still
she
clung
to
me
The
patient
Mrs
L
W
She
has
no
business
to
hang
around
me
like
she
does
Some
day
I
shall
kill
her
Dr
Do
you
know
what
you
have
been
doing
Sp
I
don
t
care
what
I
have
been
doing
I
took
a
chunk
out
of
her
wrist
one
day
but
she
clung
to
me
just
the
same
Then
I
pulled
her
hair
out
as
much
as
I
could
but
still
she
clung
I
couldn
t
get
rid
of
her
Dr
Friend
wouldn
t
you
like
to
know
what
you
have
been
doing
Sp
I
don
t
care
to
know
but
it
makes
me
so
mad
because
since
I
got
those
needles
in
me
I
don
t
seem
to
have
any
power
Dr
Where
is
the
woman
now
Sp
I
haven
t
seen
her
for
a
while
Dr
What
harm
did
she
ever
do
you
Sp
She
has
no
business
to
hang
on
to
me
like
she
does
Dr
Suppose
we
reverse
matters
and
say
that
it
is
you
who
have
been
hanging
on
to
her
Sp
She
has
no
business
to
dress
me
up
in
woman
s
clothes
and
put
woman
s
hair
on
my
head
Dr
How
long
have
you
been
dead
Sp
Dead
I
ll
show
you
that
I
m
not
dead
and
I
will
also
show
you
that
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
hold
me
either
Talk
about
me
being
dead
Laughing
harshly
Dr
Do
you
not
realize
that
you
have
been
in
a
strange
condition
for
some
time
Sp
It
s
the
worst
I
have
ever
been
in
Keep
your
hands
off
me
for
they
are
like
fire
they
are
so
hot
Dr
Has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
to
ask
how
that
woman
could
dress
you
up
Don
t
you
think
you
have
been
very
selfish
Sp
Selfish
Selfish
She
s
the
selfish
one
Dr
Suppose
you
were
an
ignorant
spirit
hovering
around
the
woman
Sp
Me
hang
around
a
woman
Not
me
no
sir
Dr
Such
things
happen
just
the
same
Did
you
ever
read
your
Bible
Do
you
remember
how
they
cast
out
spirits
in
olden
times
You
are
also
a
spirit
such
as
they
had
to
deal
with
Sp
There
were
devils
and
I
ll
show
you
I
m
no
devil
Dr
You
have
been
tormenting
a
woman
and
I
chased
you
out
with
electricity
Sp
Well
now
I
ve
caught
you
Attempting
to
fight
I
ll
bet
you
are
the
one
who
put
me
in
the
dungeon
Now
I
will
get
that
woman
and
bite
her
to
pieces
That
woman
hung
on
me
all
the
time
and
I
want
to
get
rid
of
her
Dr
You
were
hanging
on
to
her
She
is
rid
of
you
now
Try
to
understand
that
you
are
a
spirit
and
come
to
your
senses
I
am
telling
you
the
absolute
truth
Sp
I
wish
I
could
get
hold
of
that
woman
I
will
smash
her
up
good
and
I
will
smash
her
face
again
Dr
Why
should
you
want
to
do
harm
to
the
woman
She
is
not
bothering
you
Sp
I
would
like
to
get
after
you
too
Dr
If
you
don
t
behave
yourself
you
will
get
more
of
the
electricity
Sp
I
would
rather
stay
here
but
you
hold
me
too
tight
Dr
You
tell
us
you
are
a
man
but
we
can
t
see
you
We
can
only
see
a
woman
Sp
Haven
t
you
got
any
eyes
Don
t
you
know
I
am
a
man
Dr
You
have
woman
s
clothes
on
Sp
I
tore
them
off
but
she
put
them
on
and
I
tore
them
off
Dr
You
have
lost
the
woman
that
you
say
has
been
bothering
you
and
are
now
controlling
another
woman
Sp
What
do
you
mean
by
that
Dr
You
are
an
ignorant
earthbound
spirit
hovering
around
the
earth
plane
bothering
a
woman
You
are
now
using
my
wife
s
body
Sp
I
m
not
using
anybody
s
body
but
my
own
Why
did
that
woman
hang
on
to
me
Dr
You
were
doing
the
hanging
on
Since
you
have
been
taken
away
from
her
the
woman
is
getting
along
nicely
Sp
Did
you
put
me
in
that
dungeon
Dr
No
intelligent
spirits
put
you
there
You
are
very
selfish
selfish
to
the
last
degree
Don
t
you
think
you
should
try
to
realize
your
condition
If
your
record
were
written
would
you
care
to
have
everybody
read
it
Sp
I
don
t
care
I
get
so
mad
to
think
I
should
have
a
woman
hanging
on
to
me
and
then
have
her
dress
me
in
woman
s
clothes
I
hate
women
Dr
That
lady
has
been
brought
here
because
she
has
been
bothered
by
foolish
spirits
We
realized
that
it
was
obsession
and
we
drove
you
away
with
electrical
treatments
We
are
now
trying
to
bring
you
to
your
senses
Sp
If
I
could
just
get
hold
of
that
woman
I
would
bite
her
to
pieces
I
will
bite
her
arms
too
Dr
Try
to
be
sensible
then
you
will
have
understanding
and
be
able
to
progress
and
be
happy
Sp
There
is
no
happiness
Dr
Have
you
ever
tried
to
understand
God
or
the
real
question
of
life
Sp
There
is
no
God
or
there
would
be
no
misery
Dr
If
there
is
no
Supreme
Being
how
do
you
happen
to
be
How
do
you
exist
Can
you
explain
how
it
is
possible
for
you
to
talk
to
us
through
my
wife
s
body
Sp
Is
it
your
wife
that
is
hanging
on
to
me
all
the
time
Dr
You
were
bothering
a
lady
who
came
here
for
help
I
chased
you
away
from
her
then
intelligent
spirits
put
you
in
a
dungeon
Now
you
are
using
my
wife
s
body
for
a
time
SP
Why
in
the
world
should
I
be
bothering
women
when
I
hate
them
I
will
smash
every
one
I
can
Dr
Friend
if
you
ever
expect
to
be
happy
you
will
have
to
change
your
attitude
You
have
lost
your
own
body
and
are
hovering
around
the
earth
plane
obsessing
people
Selfish
spirits
always
do
that
The
insane
asylums
are
full
of
obsessed
people
You
have
tormented
this
woman
for
three
or
four
years
Sp
How
in
the
devil
could
I
get
hold
of
that
woman
I
hate
women
and
why
in
the
world
should
I
have
a
woman
hanging
on
to
me
all
the
time
I
wouldn
t
hang
on
to
a
woman
for
love
or
money
for
I
hate
women
I
would
like
to
crush
every
woman
they
are
all
deceitful
creatures
God
never
made
such
a
thing
as
a
woman
They
are
the
most
selfish
creatures
in
the
world
If
you
treat
them
to
all
kinds
of
nice
things
they
are
all
right
but
when
you
turn
your
back
they
stab
you
They
get
all
the
money
they
can
out
of
you
I
swore
revenge
on
all
women
and
I
will
have
that
revenge
I
could
have
had
a
good
home
once
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
a
woman
Revenge
is
sweet
and
I
will
have
it
Dr
Now
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
stop
and
consider
the
question
of
life
more
seriously
Don
t
you
think
you
have
made
many
mistakes
yourself
Examine
your
past
life
and
see
whether
you
have
been
perfect
Sp
No
one
is
perfect
Dr
Don
t
you
think
that
perhaps
you
had
many
faults
Sp
No
man
is
perfect
but
I
am
as
good
as
the
average
man
Dr
Try
to
understand
the
mystery
of
life
You
have
probably
been
dead
many
years
Intelligent
spirits
are
here
now
to
help
you
and
they
will
teach
you
many
wonderful
things
You
have
been
allowed
to
come
here
and
use
my
wife
s
brain
and
body
that
we
might
try
to
help
you
Sp
She
s
a
fool
to
allow
it
Dr
She
allows
it
because
she
has
charity
for
such
as
you
All
women
are
not
false
Sp
My
mother
was
a
very
good
woman
If
it
was
not
for
her
I
would
kill
every
woman
I
come
in
contact
with
But
she
has
been
dead
forty
or
fifty
years
Dr
You
are
dead
too
as
far
as
the
body
is
concerned
You
are
a
spirit
now
Look
around
and
tell
us
what
you
see
be
honest
now
Sp
I
see
my
mother
but
I
m
afraid
of
her
Dr
We
are
not
afraid
of
you
Sp
Well
my
mothers
a
ghost
Dr
She
s
a
spirit
like
yourself
What
does
your
mother
say
to
you
Sp
She
says
John
I
have
been
hunting
for
you
for
years
But
I
am
afraid
of
her
Dr
Does
she
appear
ghostly
Sp
No
but
I
am
afraid
Why
here
s
my
father
too
And
there
s
Lizzie
Don
t
you
come
near
me
I
don
t
want
you
either
Don
t
you
come
near
me
I
don
t
want
you
Lizzie
you
snake
Dr
Probably
she
has
come
to
ask
you
to
forgive
her
for
something
she
did
Sp
I
will
never
never
forgive
her
Dr
Sometimes
mistakes
happen
There
may
have
been
a
misunderstanding
You
may
have
taken
for
granted
things
that
were
not
true
Sp
I
hate
her
and
I
don

want
her
near
me
Dr
Try
to
put
hatred
out
of
your
heart
and
be
sensible
Sp
Lizzie
you
go
away
or
I
will
kill
you
You
acted
like
a
snake
I
don
t
want
to
listen
to
you
You
are
as
false
as
they
make
them
I
don
t
believe
what
you
say
Don
t
you
come
here
with
all
kinds
of
excuses
for
I
don
t
believe
you
I
am
mad
at
you
and
I
will
stay
mad
You
are
a
big
liar
Dr
What
does
the
spirit
say
to
you
Who
is
she
Sp
That
s
Lizzie
who
made
all
my
trouble
and
she
says
all
the
trouble
was
caused
by
jealousy
But
I
was
not
jealous
Dr
Listen
to
what
she
has
to
say
Sp
Listening
That
s
a
fine
story
We
were
going
to
be
married
and
she
was
a
nice
girl
She
says
I
looked
at
everything
the
wrong
way
and
that
I
was
jealous
Dr
You
were
probably
stubborn
and
hot
headed
Sp
To
Lizzie
You
re
a
liar
You
went
with
that
other
fellow
you
know
you
did
She
says
that
when
she
went
home
that
evening
she
happened
to
meet
that
fellow
on
the
street
car
He
only
walked
a
block
with
her
and
I
happened
to
see
them
walking
together
I
went
home
and
stabbed
myself
Dr
That
was
certainly
a
brave
act
I
suppose
you
committed
suicide
Sp
I
wish
I
could
have
died
but
I
could
not
I
would
have
been
far
better
off
but
I
m
going
to
have
revenge
on
women
Dr
Why
don
t
you
try
to
be
sensible
and
forgive
the
girl
Sp
Say
do
you
believe
her
story
I
suffered
a
great
deal
from
that
stab
I
gave
myself
and
I
did
wish
I
could
die
There
s
Lizzie
walking
around
and
she
s
crying
Dr
Listen
to
your
own
conscience
Sp
I
loved
that
girl
and
what
did
I
get
from
her
Dr
I
think
your
mother
spoiled
you
when
you
were
a
boy
Sp
My
mother
thought
the
world
of
me
and
gave
me
every
thing
I
wanted
so
that
I
could
have
a
good
time
No
Mother
don
t
come
near
me
There
is
no
help
for
me
Dr
The
first
lesson
you
must
learn
is
to
crucify
self
Jesus
said
Except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
I
don
t
think
you
understand
what
that
means
All
you
cared
for
was
self
and
your
mother
spoiled
you
Sp
Mother
says
she
is
very
sorry
now
Here
s
Lizzie
again
I
don
t
believe
her
because
she
did
go
with
that
fellow
Dr
Suppose
she
did
what
of
it
You
must
have
had
a
very
jealous
disposition
Sp
She
says
she
did
not
go
with
him
and
that
she
has
told
me
what
she
did
Dr
Do
you
know
that
she
is
dead
Sp
She
is
not
If
she
Is
is
she
a
ghost
Dr
You
say
she
stands
there
Does
she
look
like
a
ghost
Sp
No
she
doesn
t
My
mother
says
John
be
reasonable
and
sensible
Your
own
conscience
accuses
you
It
is
hard
when
you
love
a
girl
to
see
her
with
another
fellow
What
I
suffered
on
account
of
Lizzie
After
seeing
her
with
the
other
fellow
I
went
home
and
stabbed
myself
just
a
little
bit
to
try
and
scare
her
I
thought
if
I
did
that
she
would
come
to
me
Dr
You
committed
suicide
but
you
do
not
realize
that
you
are
a
spirit
and
have
been
troubling
a
lady
and
obsessing
her
She
is
a
patient
of
ours
Sp
What
do
I
care
for
her
I
hate
women
and
she
won
t
leave
me
alone
All
I
wanted
was
revenge
and
I
got
it
Dr
That
lady
has
done
all
kinds
of
wild
things
because
you
were
obsessing
her
Sp
Mother
and
Lizzie
both
stand
there
crying
but
nobody
cares
for
me
so
what
s
the
use
Dr
What
name
did
you
have
beside
John
Sp
John
Sullivan
Dr
I
should
think
you
would
feel
ashamed
to
have
bothered
that
lady
Sp
I
m
not
any
more
ashamed
of
myself
than
you
are
Dr
Do
you
think
you
loved
this
girl
Or
was
it
only
selfishness
on
your
part
You
simply
wanted
her
that
s
all
Sp
She
could
have
been
mine
but
I
made
her
suffer
My
love
turned
to
hate
No
Lizzie
you
don
t
need
to
cry
I
shall
never
forgive
you
if
you
ask
me
a
hundred
times
Dr
If
your
mother
had
given
you
a
few
thrashings
you
would
not
be
in
the
condition
you
are
now
Try
to
forgive
Lizzie
and
by
doing
so
you
will
be
helped
yourself
Sp
I
shall
never
forgive
her
The
women
were
all
crazy
after
me
I
was
considered
a
good
looking
man
Dr
That
was
your
trouble
If
you
had
been
homely
you
would
have
had
some
sense
You
must
try
to
be
sensible
now
because
you
are
using
my
wife
s
body
Sp
Well
take
your
wife
I
don
t
want
her
Say
Mother
it
s
no
use
you
and
Lizzie
standing
there
and
crying
for
I
shall
never
forgive
her
Dr
If
you
don
t
forgive
when
you
have
this
opportunity
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
dark
dungeon
when
you
leave
here
and
there
you
will
stay
until
you
repent
Try
to
understand
that
the
wrong
is
within
yourself
Sp
I
ll
not
forgive
I
loved
my
mother
and
I
always
had
plenty
of
money
Dr
What

St

Do

it

Dr
It
is

Sp
I
do
hate
to
see

Mother

To
see
a

always
distresses
me
Dr
Doesn
t
your
conscience
trouble
you
at
all
Sp
What
s
the
use
of
worrying
about
things
Dr
Listen
to
what
your
mother
says
then
she
can
help
you
Sp
Mother
I
ll
tell
you
if
you
had
spanked
me
more
when
I
was
a
little
boy
and
not
given
in
to
me
so
much
I
might
have
been
a
different
fellow
from
what
I
am
now
It
is
too
late
in
life
to
change
and
what
s
more
one
never
gets
anywhere
by
changing
Dr
You
still
have
more
misery
ahead
of
you
unless
you
are
willing
to
forgive
Sp
I
don
t
care
to
be
in
that
dungeon
you
speak
of
Why
do
parents
give
their
children
all
they
want
You
see
Mother
what
nice
work
you
have
done
Aren
t
you
proud
of
your
son
You
brought
me
to
this
This
is
your
work
Dr
You
pretend
to
love
your
mother
but
you
have
no
charity
or
sympathy
for
anybody
Sp
I
hate
the
word
sympathy
My
father
says
I
shall
have
to
change
I
am
too
old
to
change
now
Frightened
and
shrinking
from
something
Take
that
away
Take
me
away
I
m
sick
Dr
You
must
be
serious
and
honest
Sp
My
mother
says
she
knows
that
she
raised
me
wrong
Don
t
let
me
go
in
that
dungeon
I
ll
forgive
Lizzie
I
ll
do
anything
I
am
tired
of
life
and
tired
of
everything
Dr
When
you
reach
the
spirit
side
of
life
you
must
try
to
be
of
service
to
others
instead
of
a
detriment
Try
to
undo
the
wrong
you
have
done
by
obsessing
this
lady
Sp
She
tormented
me
and
I
hate
women
I
got
revenge
I
took
a
slipper
and
pounded
her
face
I
did
it
for
revenge
on
women
for
I
hate
them
all
The
spirit
could
not
be
brought
to
realize
his
situation
and
he
was
taken
away
to
be
placed
in
a
dungeon
until
he
could
overcome
self
and
his
hatred
toward
humanity
Several
years
ago
a
friend
of
ours
complained
of
the
peculiar
and
erratic
actions
of
a
business
associate
Mr
P
who
had
suddenly
become
extremely
irritable
and
despotic
to
those
in
his
employ
highly
unreasonable
impossible
to
please
and
subject
to
violent
attacks
of
swearing
As
obsession
seemed
indicated
we
concentrated
for
the
gentleman
in
question
and
after
several
weeks
an
irate
spirit
spoke
through
Mrs
Wickland
and
frankly
admitted
having
tormented
this
man
wanting
revenge
for
attentions
which
he
claimed
the
latter
had
been
paying
to
his
wife
The
situation
had
existed
during
his
life
but
he
did
not
discover
this
until
after
his
death
The
spirit
gave
the
name
of
a
man
prominent
in
local
business
circles
he
had
passed
out
some
time
before
but
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
He
said
that
he
had
been
sick
for
a
long
time
but
could
now
go
where
he
pleased
without
any
trouble
for
he
had
become
well
He
could
not
understand
why
his
wife
would
no
longer
speak
to
him
or
why
his
child
who
had
always
been
so
affectionate
was
now
so
cold
toward
him
He
declared
that
some
of
his
friends
were
false
to
him
and
had
for
some
time
been
paying
attention
to
his
wife
sending
her
gifts
and
flowers
but
that
he
would
have
revenge
on
them
as
soon
as
he
was
through
with
his
present
victim
The
spirit
said
that
he
could
not
think
very
clearly
but
supposed
that
was
because
he
had
recently
taken
an
anaesthetic
which
he
thought
also
accounted
for
the
peculiar
lightness
of
his
body
and
a
feeling
of
having
no
weight
He
was
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
whenever
he
thought
about
any
persons
he
immediately
found
himself
with
them
and
involved
in
their
affairs
Recently
he
had
been
around
Mr
P
but
could
not
get
away
from
him
this
had
exasperated
him
exceedingly
he
had
done
a
lot
of
swearing
kept
the
man
awake
made
him
go
to
work
early
and
had
annoyed
him
in
every
way
possible
After
many
explanations
the
spirit
finally
realized
that
he
had
died
although
this
was
at
first
difficult
for
him
to
comprehend
for
he
had
always
thought
death
ended
all
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
Being
assured
that
activity
and
progression
awaited
him
in
the
spirit
world
and
that
matters
would
there
be
explained
to
him
to
his
entire
satisfaction
he
left
The
following
day
there
was
such
a
remarkable
improvement
in
the
conduct
of
Mr
P
and
his
behavior
was
so
wholly
normal
that
the
entire
office
force
noticed
the
change
although
Mr
P
himself
never
knew
of
the
experimental
effort
which
had
been
made
in
his
behalf
A
patient
Miss
R
F
was
intermittently
seized
by
impulses
to
run
away
and
at
such
times
became
greatly
agitated
but
shortly
after
entering
our
Institute
she
was
relieved
of
the
instigator
of
these
wanderings

I

It

did
not

I
went

a
long

and
after
waking
up
I
found
I
had
long
hair
and
I
wasn

going

have
that
so
I
would
look
like
a

I
could
not
go

a
barber
shop
cause
I
was
too
ashamed
to
be
seen
on

so
I
cut
it
off

Dr
You
did
not
cut

you
cut
off
the

I

You
have
lost
your
physical
body
When
you
lose
that
you
are
supposed
to
be
dead
Sp
If
I
was
dead
I
would
go
to
the
grave
and
stay
there
until
the
last
day
You
stay
there
until
Gabriel
blows
his
horn
Dr
That
is
only
ignorant
belief
You
were
too
lazy
to
understand
life
s
mysteries
Sp
I
was
taught
that
when
I
died
if
I
believed
in
God
and
Christ
and
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
I
would
go
to
Heaven
Dr
Why
did
you
not
go
to
Heaven
when
you
died
You
have
died
so
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
You
are
here
and
yet
we
cannot
see
you
I
see
only
my
wife
s
body
Sp
I
have
never
seen
your
wife
and
I
don
t
know
her
Dr
Have
you
ever
heard
about
mediums
Sp
Yes
but
I
don
t
believe
in
them
Dr
You
are
speaking
through
a
medium
now
You
claim
to
be
a
man
and
yet
you
are
using
a
woman
s
body
to
speak
through
Sp
Lies
nothing
but
lies
Dr
It
is
true
nevertheless
You
have
woman
s
clothes
on
You
know
there
is
something
strange
about
your
condition
You
probably
do
not
know
that
you
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
No
I
am
not
Dr
Where
should
you
be
Sp
I
have
been
on
the
go
for
some
time
traveling
Dr
Look
at
your
hands
they
are
not
yours
Sp
I
never
saw
you
before
you
put
all
that
electricity
into
me
and
I
feel
like
giving
you
a
good
licking
What
do
you
think
of
any
man
doing
such
a
thing
to
another
man
It
goes
right
through
you
You
don
t
know
how
it
hurts
I
m
not
going
to
stand
for
any
more
such
nonsense
I
stood
it
for
a
long
time
then
I
went
When
I
left
a
great
big
Indian
spirit
got
hold
of
me
and
put
me
in
prison
I
got
loose
after
awhile
and
came
here
Dr
You
have
been
bothering
a
woman
who
was
a
patient
of
ours
and
electrical
treatments
given
to
her
dislodged
you
Sp
What
is
the
matter
with
me
I
have
felt
so
crowded
Dr
Can
t
you
understand
that
you
are
in
a
strange
situation
You
were
probably
a
big
man
and
you
felt
crowded
because
you
were
occupying
a
body
smaller
than
your
own
physical
body
Why
don
t
you
open
your
mind
and
learn
the
facts
Sp
There
s
nothing
to
learn
Dr
It
has
probably
been
a
long
time
since
you
lost
your
body
What
year
is
it
Sp
I
had
a
good
long
sleep
and
I
don
t
know
Dr
Shouldn
t
your
present
strange
condition
cause
you
to
ask
questions
We
cannot
see
you
we
can
only
hear
you
talk
Sp
What
sense
is
there
in
talking
to
a
person
when
you
don
t
see
him
Dr
This
lady
is
a
psychic
and
you
are
a
spirit
talking
through
her
body
Sp
I
don
t
believe
you
Dr
This
is
my
wife
s
body
Are
you
my
wife
talking
to
me
Sp
I
m
not
your
wife
I
m
a
man
Dr
I
drove
you
away
from
the
woman
you
were
controlling
You
made
her
act
like
an
insane
person
How
did
you
come
here
Sp
You
tell
me
how
Dr
You
are
an
invisible
spirit
you
do
not
understand
your
situation
The
lady
you
have
been
bothering
happened
to
be
in
a
nervous
condition
and
susceptible
to
spirit
obsession
and
you
obsessed
her
You
made
that
lady
do
many
insane
things
What
do
you
think
of
such
actions
Sp
I
wouldn
t
say
it
was
anything
very
grand
but
I
don
t
even
know
any
woman
Dr
You
influenced
her
to
cut
off
her
hair
and
to
run
away
Sp
What
did
I
want
with
long
hair
I
went
to
sleep
and
when
I
woke
up
my
hair
had
grown
too
long
so
I
cut
it
off
that
s
all
Dr
That
was
the
woman
s
hair
you
cut
Sp
It
was
too
long
Dr
That
is
her
business
Just
reverse
things
Suppose
you
had
your
own
body
and
somebody
cut
your
hair
off
would
you
like
it
Sp
No
I
wouldn
t
but
she
couldn
t
help
yourself
Dr
Don
t
you
think
that
you
were
very
selfish
Sp
I
don
t
know
Say
if
as
you
say
I
m
dead
why
is
it
that
I
m
not
in
Heaven
or
hell
Dr
There
are
no
such
places
Sp
I
haven
t
seen
God
or
Christ
or
the
devil
yet
you
tell
me
I
am
dead
Dr
You
are
not
dead
Sp
Why
just
a
little
while
ago
you
said
I
was
Dr
You
are
dead
to
the
world
Sp
You
said
I
was
dead
Dr
I
said
you
were
so
called
dead
you
lost
your
physical
body
Sp
You
said
I
was
dead
Dr
Now
listen
to
reason
or
I
will
have
to
take
you
into
the
office
and
give
you
more
electricity
Sp
I
don
t
want
that
it
makes
you
feel
like
you
were
burning
up
Dr
We
wanted
to
get
you
out
and
we
succeeded
Sp
What
business
is
it
of
yours
if
I
stayed
there
Dr
We
wanted
that
lady
to
be
rid
of
you
Sp
You
had
no
right
to
get
me
away
from
her
Dr
Do
you
think
it
was
right
of
you
to
control
her
and
disturb
her
life
Sp
A
fellow
has
got
to
have
some
place
to
live
Dr
Suppose
it
had
been
your
mother
and
a
selfish
spirit
were
controlling
her
and
making
her
act
as
if
insane
do
you
think
that
would
be
right
Sp
I
was
not
insane
and
I
did
not
make
her
insane
either
Dr
It
was
an
insane
act
for
her
to
cut
off
her
hair
and
run
away
Sp
How
would
you
like
to
have
your
hair
long
if
you
were
a
man
Dr
It
was
the
lady
s
body
and
the
lady
s
hair
not
yours
Now
you
have
been
driven
from
the
lady
s
body
and
you
must
change
your
conduct
If
you
are
not
careful
you
will
be
put
into
a
dungeon
You
said
a
short
time
ago
that
an
Indian
got
hold
of
you
you
had
better
be
careful
or
another
Indian
will
get
hold
of
you
Sp
I
will
fight
him
if
he
does
Dr
Listen
to
me
My
wife
is
a
psychic
and
she
allows
such
spirits
as
you
to
control
her
body
to
bring
them
to
a
realization
of
their
condition
You
should
appreciate
the
privilege
There
are
thousands
of
spirits
who
would
be
glad
to
be
in
your
place
at
this
moment
You
know
that
you
are
in
a
strange
condition
Perhaps
some
of
your
kindred
are
here
They
will
take
you
with
them
to
the
spirit
world
You
must
behave
yourself
and
understand
and
be
sensible
Sp
What
shall
I
do
Dr
Understand
that
there
is
a
spirit
world
and
that
you
should
strive
to
reach
it
Sp
You
mean
Heaven
Dr
The
Kingdom
of
Heaven
is
within
one
Sp
Don
t
you
believe
that
Christ
died
for
your
sins
Dr
He
did
not
die
for
mine
Don
t
you
understand
that
something
is
lacking
in
such
a
belief
Jesus
taught
us
how
to
understand
life
he
did
not
die
for
the
sins
of
any
one
Those
who
believe
that
Christ
died
for
their
sins
lack
the
right
understanding
of
His
teachings
It
is
a
sin
against
God
to
teach
such
a
doctrine
If
it
were
true
it
would
mean
that
God
had
made
a
mistake
and
was
forced
to
provide
an
intercessor
as
an
offering
of
atonement
for
His
own
mistake
Now
friend
you
must
leave
my
wife
and
you
must
also
leave
the
other
lady
alone
Sp
What
are
you
talking
about
I
never
saw
your
wife
Dr
You
are
temporarily
controlling
my
wife
s
body
We
cannot
see
you
If
you
do
not
come
to
your
senses
pretty
soon
we
shall
have
to
force
you
out
and
then
you
will
be
in
the
outer
darkness
which
the
Bible
speaks
about
Sp
It
is
not
right
that
God
should
treat
me
as
he
has
I
prayed
and
prayed
and
prayed
I
went
to
church
and
paid
a
whole
lot
of
money
to
the
church
because
they
said
if
I
did
not
give
money
I
would
go
straight
to
hell
when
I
died
and
I
thought
when
I
paid
my
money
I
should
get
my
money
s
worth
Dr
What
did
Jesus
say
God
is
Spirit
and
they
that
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
Spirit
and
in
truth
God
is
Spirit
not
a
spirit
The
Bible
says
God
is
Love
and
He
that
dwelleth
in
Love
dwelleth
in
God
Where
will
you
look
to
find
such
a
God
except
within
your
own
self
Ye
are
the
temple
of
God
and
the
spirit
of
God
dwelleth
in
you
What
is
Heaven
It
is
a
condition
of
your
own
mind
attained
when
you
understand
life
s
purpose
Sp
Isn
t
Heaven
a
place
It
says
so
in
the
Bible
it
says
Heaven
is
paved
with
golden
streets
Isn
t
that
so
Dr
That
like
many
other
statements
in
the
Bible
is
symbolical
of
great
truths
of
life
Sp
You
said
a
short
time
ago
that
Jesus
did
not
die
for
your
sins
What
do
you
believe
Dr
I
recognize
that
we
are
all
spiritual
beings
in
mortal
bodies
while
on
earth
When
we
pass
out
of
our
mortal
bodies
with
understanding
we
will
not
waken
in
darkness
but
our
spiritual
eyes
will
be
open
and
advanced
spirits
will
help
us
to
progress
in
the
spirit
world
Some
kind
spirit
friends
of
yours
may
be
here
now
Do
you
not
realize
that
some
change
has
taken
place
with
you
Sp
I
can
talk
more
than
I
could
You
said
I
was
talking
through
your
wife
How
can
I
talk
through
her
Dr
My
wife
is
a
psychic
who
is
so
developed
that
spirits
can
talk
through
her
and
intelligent
spirits
have
allowed
you
to
control
her
However
you
will
not
be
able
to
stay
long
Sp
I
think
I
will
stay
here
I
feel
better
I
feel
pretty
good
now
Dr
You
will
feel
still
better
after
you
realize
the
beautiful
condition
in
the
spirit
world
You
will
have
to
become
as
a
little
child
then
you
can
enter
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
Do
not
merely
believe
but
try
to
understand
What
is
your
name
Sp
Edward
Dr
And
your
other
name
Sp
I
don
t
know
Dr
Where
did
you
live
Do
you
know
that
you
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Do
you
know
what
year
it
is
Sp
No
I
don
t
know
Dr
Why
don
t
you
know
Sp
I
have
no
memory
I
can
t
think
I
don
t
know
anything
any
more
Such
a
state
of
bewilderment
suggests
that
the
cause
of
amnesia
conditions
found
in
certain
patients
is
probably
possession
by
confused
spirit
intelligences
Dr
That
is
because
you
have
been
in
the
outer
darkness
and
being
a
wandering
spirit
you
drifted
into
that
lady
s
aura
controlled
her
and
made
her
act
as
if
insane
Sp
I
wanted
to
have
a
good
quiet
home
Dr
Is
it
right
to
do
the
things
you
have
done
Sp
When
you
have
been
walking
in
darkness
for
a
long
time
and
you
see
a
light
don
t
you
want
to
stay
Dr
That
is
not
the
right
kind
of
light
You
need
the
spiritual
light
of
understanding
Sp
Then
do
you
think
I
ought
to
go
to
church
and
sing
and
pray
to
God
and
read
the
Bible
Dr
Did
you
ever
make
a
thorough
study
of
the
history
of
the
Bible
to
learn
who
wrote
it
Sp
It
was
God
s
inspired
book
Dr
God
did
not
write
the
Bible
the
book
is
man
made
Could
one
credit
God
with
having
written
certain
things
in
the
Bible
many
of
which
are
unfit
to
be
read
in
respectable
society
Sp
Who
wrote
the
book
Dr
It
was
compiled
from
many
sources
during
different
periods
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
people
in
subjection
through
fear
of
an
imaginary
devil
and
hell
The
Bible
is
a
collection
of
poetry
history
allegories
and
philosophy
of
contradictions
and
truths
But
humanity
believes
that
every
word
of
the
Bible
is
inspired
and
insists
upon
interpreting
it
literally
instead
of
accepting
what
is
reasonable
The
Bible
states
that
The
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
and
Spiritual
things
are
spiritually
discerned
Hence
religion
is
a
process
of
mental
discernment
The
teachings
of
Christ
contain
wonderful
truths
but
the
allegories
have
been
taught
as
historical
facts
by
the
church
and
dogma
doctrine
and
creed
have
obscured
their
underlying
spiritual
significance
SP
Don
t
you
believe
that
God
made
the
earth
in
six
days
and
rested
on
the
seventh
Dr
No
that
is
only
an
allegorical
statement
The
seven
days
are
symbolical
of
the
seven
principles
in
Nature
God
is
at
once
the
Creator
and
the
Creation
if
God
should
rest
all
would
be
at
an
end
We
should
understand
life
as
it
is
not
merely
believe
what
is
told
us
Now
it
is
getting
late
and
you
cannot
stay
any
longer
See
whether
some
one
is
here
whom
you
know
Sp
Oh
There
s
my
mother
It
s
a
long
time
since
I
saw
her
But
she
died
when
I
was
a
kid

Listen
to
her
she
can
help
you

Oh
mother
will
you
take
me
I
Take
me
mother
I
m
so
tired
Oh
mother
take
me
with
you
Dr
Of
course
she
will
take
you
with
her
but
you
will
have
to
rid
yourself
of
all
your
foolish
beliefs
and
acquire
understanding
Sp
Let
me
go
Rising
to
walk
away
Dr
You
will
have
to
think
yourself
with
your
mother
You
can
t
take
this
body
with
you
because
it
belongs
to
my
wife
Just
think
yourself
with
your
mother
and
you
will
be
there
instantly

I
m
so
tired
and
weary
so
tired
Let
me
go
with
my
mother
I
see
her
coming
she
went
away
for
a
while
Dr
Now
go
with
your
mother
God
gave
you
intelligence
to
think
and
you
must
be
reasonable
and
let
your
mother
and
others
teach
you
Sp
Mother
says
I
must
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
being
so
rude
and
she
also
says
I
must
ask
that
lady
to
please
forgive
me
for
bothering
her
Dr
Can
you
tell
us
where
you
came
from
Sp
I
can
t
remember
Dr
What
year
do
you
think
it
is

It
should
be

That
was
nineteen
years
ago
Who
is

President
Sp
McKinley
Dr
He
was
shot
on

sixth

died

fourteenth

Where
have
I
been
all
that
time
Sleeping
The
winter
of

awfully
sick

it
seems
hard
to
remember
anything
else
after
that
It
was
around
Christmas
and
I
caught
cold
and
I
was
very
sick
Dr
Where
were
you
when
you
were
taken
sick
Sp
I
was
working
in
the
woods
I
worked
in
a
lumber
town
at
lumbering
I
remember
something
hitting
me
on
the
head
and
that
s
all
I
remember
My
mother
says
my
name
is
Sterling
yes
that
s
it
Dr
Can
your
mother
tell
what
place
you
came
from
before
you
took
up
lumbering
Sp
I
was
born
in
Iowa
mother
says
but
when
I
got
hurt
I
was
working
in
the
woods
in
Northern
Wisconsin
I
used
to
live
in
Iowa
Dr
Can
you
remember
the
name
of
the
town
Sp
No
I
can
t
Dr
Well
friend
try
to
obtain
an
understanding
of
life
and
be
of
service
to
humanity
instead
of
a
detriment
You
have
been
bothering
a
lady
and
she
is
not
yet
entirely
free
Sp
I
was
not
the
only
one
bothering
her
there
are
two
more
just
as
bad
as
I
am
Dr
When
you
have
understanding
you
must
help
this
lady
to
get
well
and
take
the
other
spirits
away
from
her
Sp
I
will
try
Thank

Goodbye

Haunted
houses
are
often
frequented
by
spirits
who
seek
revenge
for
wrongs
suffered
by
them
during
life
While
Mrs
Wickland
and
I
were
in
Wisconsin
we
held
a
circle
in
the
home
of
friends
and
Mrs
Wickland
was
controlled
by
the
spirit
of
a
man
who
said
he
had
been
murdered
by
the
owner
of
a
near
by
stone
quarry
but
that
he
was
still
alive
in
his
house
at
the
side
of
the
quarry
He
laughed
spitefully
and
said
He
killed
me
but
I
am
having
my
revenge
I
haunt
him
Although
we
explained
to
the
spirit
the
existence
of
a
higher
life
he
stated
that
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
leave
his
old
haunts
and
refusing
to
progress
departed
Our
friends
then
told
us
that
they
had
known
this
man
in
life
that
ten
years
before
the
quarry
had
been
owned
by
three
men
one
of
whom
desiring
to
own
the
quarry
himself
had
bought
the
holdings
of
the
second
man
but
the
third
man
who
lived
in
the
house
by
the
quarry
had
refused
to
sell
A
few
days
later
the
third
man
was
found
dead
and
although
there
was
no
proof
as
to
the
identity
of
the
murderer
there
was
a
strong
suspicion
in
the
neighborhood
that
the
first
partner
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
As
time
went
on
the
owner
of
the
stone
quarry
developed
a
strange
reluctance
to
work
the
quarry
and
rumor
said
that
he
was
haunted
by
his
dead
partner
It
became
common
report
that
the
house
nearby
was
haunted
and
when
our
friends
had
driven
there
a
year
before
to
pick
berries
they
had
had
an
unusual
experience
After
placing
the
horse
in
the
empty
barn
they
noticed
some
berries
in
the
yard
and
returned
to
the
barn
for
a
basket
when
the
horse
began
to
rear
wildly
and
neighed
in
terror
Stopping
in
amazement
our
friends
heard
a
coarse
laugh
and
looking
about
saw
a
grinning
man
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
deserted
house
It
was
the
man
who
had
died
several
years
before
they
had
known
him
in
life
and
recognized
him
now
The
man
laughed
and
vanished
and
our
friends
rushed
to
the
barn
took
the
horse
out
and
drove
away
in
great
haste
We
had
a
series
of
letters
from
Mrs
G
G
who
resided
in
a
village
in
New
York
she
was
a
psychic
and
clairvoyant
whose
house
was
haunted
by
a
band
of
evil
spirits
She
wrote
that
she
had
been
in
the
best
of
health
when
she
had
moved
into
this
house
but
had
soon
become
afflicted
with
a
strange
ailment
of
the
arms
and
legs
which
no
doctors
could
relieve
Spirits
who
claimed
to
be
her
guides
advised
her
to
have
a
psychic
circle
every
evening
and
sit
for
half
an
hour
saying
they
could
help
her
in
this
way
They
explained
that
she
was
being
injured
by
the
spirit
of
the
woman
who
had
built
the
house
and
that
she
could
free
herself
by
having
a
certain
friend
of
hers
attend
the
next
circle
This
friend
came
and
the
spirit
said
she
would
leave
with
this
woman
When
the
latter
reached
her
home
she
was
taken
with
the
same
sickness
with
which
Mrs
G
G
had
been
troubled
while
Mrs
G
G
recovered
But
disturbances
of
various
kinds
continued
in
the
house
even
the
orchard
was
haunted
and
spirits
were
heard
to
say
that
Mrs
G
G
could
not
live
if
she
remained
there
for
they
would
kill
any
one
who
came
into
that
house
The
G
s
sold
the
house
and
moved
away
without
telling
the
purchasers
anything
of
their
mysterious
experiences
The
new
owners
took
possession
of
the
house
and
the
mother
an
elderly
lady
went
to
bed
the
first
night
apparently
well
but
in
a
short
time
screamed
that
two
men
had
come
into
her
room
threatening
to
kill
her
and
before
morning
she
was
dead
Mrs
G
G
however
continued
her
circles
but
was
unable
to
rid
herself
of
spirit
influences
and
finally
wrote
to
us
for
aid
There
is
no
one
I
can
go
to
or
depend
upon
I
joined
the
New
Thought
Society
to
be
helped
they
claimed
to
send
out
vibrations
but
I
failed
to
get
in
on
the
wave
No
one
prays
more
earnestly
for
help
than
or
tries
harder
to
do
right
Tell
me
if
you
can
how
to
get
relief
We
concentrated
for
the
lady
as
well
as
the
house
and
a
number
of
spirits
were
brought
from
both
One
of
the
first
declared
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
obsessing
Mrs
G
G
Another
spirit
was
Harry
Harris
who
had
so
brutally
mistreated
his
wife
that
she
had
shot
herself
How
his
life
had
ended
we
did
not
learn
He
insisted
that
he
was
not
dead
but
was
living
in
an
old
house
with
a
band
of
outlaws
spirits
and
that
they
would
kill
any
one
who
dared
to
move
into
their
house
Another
evening
four
spirits
were
brought
from
the
haunted
house
first
two
women
then
Pete
who
had
been
a
dexterous
pickpocket
in
life
and
a
woman
named
Kate
who
had
been
killed
by
Pete
and
had
hounded
him
ever
since
To
conceal
himself
Pete
was
hiding
with
others
in
a
house
that
belonged
to
them
and
to
no
one
else
We
kill
any
one
who
comes
in
he
said
speaking
through
Mrs
Wickland
He
admitted
having
troubled
Mrs
G
G
I
stayed
with
her
to
get
my
grub
he
said
While
Pete
was
speaking
Kate
took
control
of
another
medium
who
was
in
the
circle
and
Pete
was
terror
stricken
while
Kate
attempted
to
escape
from
him
Each
thought
the
other
was
a
ghost
and
neither
was
aware
of
controlling
a
psychic
It
was
some
time
before
they
realized
that
both
had
died
Finally
Pete
sank
on
his
knees
and
begged
Kate
to
forgive
him
a
reconciliation
followed
and
both
left
promising
to
reform
Later
Mrs
G
G
wrote
that
she
had
greatly
improved
In
answer
to
an
urgent
appeal
for
help
Mrs
Wickland
and
I
called
at
the
home
of
Mr
and
Mrs
C
in
Pasadena
where
nightly
rappings
and
noises
were
keeping
the
family
awake
for
hours
Mr
C
had
purchased
this
house
from
the
children
of
an
elderly
lady
who
had
died
some
time
before
A
fact
not
known
to
us
until
later
The
house
had
been
moved
to
Mr
C
s
lot
remodeled
there
and
the
C
s
had
then
moved
into
it
only
to
be
disturbed
by
noises
of
all
kinds
Every
night
between
twelve
and
four
the
door
of
a
closet
between
two
bedrooms
was
shaken
and
rattled
loudly
and
rappings
and
crackings
kept
the
family
awake
While
we
were
seated
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
C
home
discussing
the
situation
Mrs
Wickland
became
unexpectedly
entranced
by
a
spirit
who
complained
of
intense
rheumatism
and
stormed
at
the
C
s
for
living
in
her
house
This
is
my
house
she
declared
peremptorily
and
these
people
have
no
business
in
it
I
will
chase
them
out
The
controlling
spirit
proved
to
be
the
former
owner
of
the
house
and
later
inquiry
bore
out
the
statement
that
she
had
suffered
severely
from
rheumatism
She
could
not
realize
that
she
was
dead
but
insisted
that
she
was
still
living
in
her
own
house
although
troubled
by
intruders
If
I
am
dead
why
am
I
not
in
Heaven
she
asked
Many
explanations
at
last
resulted
in
understanding
and
a
penitent
departure
and
in
a
letter
written
several
months
later
Mr
C
stated
that
all
noises
had
entirely
ceased
in
the
house
That
spirits
often
play
a
serious
part
in
domestic
disturbances
and
break
up
many
homes
we
have
had
ample
evidence
A
patient
Mrs
SI
who
was
brought
to
us
from
a
Northern
state
was
the
second
wife
of
a
Dakota
farmer
After
the
birth
of
her
first
child
she
developed
a
tendency
to
wander
away
at
random
and
when
brought
back
and
questioned
she
could
only
give
vague
answers
but
always
insisted
that
her
husband
a
steady
reliable
farmer
was
faithless
to
her
When
the
obsessing
spirit
was
transferred
to
Mrs
Wickland
we
found
that
it
was
none
other
than
the
first
wife
who
indignantly
accused
her
husband
of
being
faithless
to
her
and
said
that
she
was
determined
to
get
rid
of
her
rival
After
passing
out
of
the
physical
body
she
had
remained
on
the
farm
but
she
was
unaware
of
her
death
and
did
not
realize
that
her
rival
was
her
husband
s
second
wife
The
spirit
after
due
explanation
and
enlightenment
left
and
Mrs
SI
restored
to
herself
returned
to
her
Dakota
home
We
had
a
similar
experience
with
an
acquaintance
of
ours
a
gentleman
whose
first
wife
had
died
leaving
him
to
care
for
their
small
son
Later
he
married
again
but
before
long
we
noticed
that
the
family
life
was
becoming
unhappy
and
the
culmination
came
one
Sunday
morning
when
the
second
wife
angrily
left
the
house
The
husband
desolately
came
to
our
home
followed
presently
by
the
little
boy
and
although
they
had
never
visited
us
before
they
remained
for
some
hours
In
the
evening
the
boy
returned
and
while
Mrs
Wickland
was
conversing
with
him
and
a
group
of
friends
she
became
controlled
by
the
spirit
of
a
woman
who
said
she
was
the
boy
s
mother
She
had
no
knowledge
of
her
death
and
craved
longingly
to
caress
her
small
son
saying
I
want
my
boy
I
want
my
boy
Then
she
burst
forth
into
a
jealous
denunciation
of
her
successor
and
declared
she
would
drive
her
out
of
the
house
I
chased
her
away
this
morning
she
exulted
She
too
was
finally
made
to
understand
the
true
situation
and
regretting
the
suffering
she
had
caused
promised
to
do
everything
possible
to
make
amends
The
second
wife
returned
home
again
and
during
the
ten
years
which
have
elapsed
since
this
episode
no
further
disturbances
have
occurred
in
the
family
Miss
L
was
the
young
fiancee
of
a
widower
who
had
formerly
with
his
wife
occupied
a
flat
in
the
same
building
in
which
the
Young
lady
lived
and
the
two
women
had
been
intimate
friends
The
wife
died
very
suddenly
and
some
time
after
her
death
the
gentleman
became
engaged
to
the
young
lady
Soon
after
this
the
latter
began
to
show
mental
abnormalities
which
continually
grew
worse
In
her
normal
condition
she
esteemed
the
man
highly
but
when
she
came
to
us
she
had
a
violent
dislike
for
him
and
asserted
that
she
would
rather
die
or
go
to
an
insane
asylum
than
marry
him
She
had
made
several
attempts
to
end
her
life
but
had
each
time
seemed
to
come
to
herself
at
the
last
moment
and
called
for
help
At
the
time
the
patient
entered
the
Institute
Mrs
Wickland
clairvoyantly
saw
the
spirit
of
a
woman
of
the
brunette
type
possessing
the
patient
who
was
a
decided
blond
This
spirit
was
so
interblended
with
the
patient
that
it
was
difficult
for
Mrs
Wickland
to
determine
from
the
transfiguration
whether
the
patient
was
light
or
dark
When
Mrs
Wickland
described
this
spirit
the
patient
s
mother
and
fiance
both
recognized
her
as
the
man
s
former
wife
The
patient
proved
very
obdurate
screaming
spells
alternated
with
obstinate
stubborn
moods
and
she
could
not
be
left
alone
at
any
time
She
declared
herself
insane
and
scoffed
at
being
cured
and
insisted
that
she
wanted
to
die
for
if
she
lived
she
would
have
to
marry
that
man
One
day
during
a
treatment
she
entered
a
semi
trance
condition
and
a
spirit
intelligence
expressed
itself
forcefully
He
shall
never
marry
her
He
shall
never
have
her
I
will
drive
her
to
an
insane
asylum
or
I
will
kill
her
but
he
shall
never
have
her
Immediately
following
this
the
spirit
of
a
child
spoke
defensively
as
if
protecting
a
mother
The
patient
s
sister
who
was
present
recognized
in
the
latter
intelligence
the
deceased
thirteen
year
old
son
of
the
dead
wife
The
climax
came
a
few
days
later
The
patient
had
been
unusually
obstinate
and
unruly
and
very
contemptuous
to
her
fiance
when
he
called
After
a
strong
treatment
was
administered
the
patient
became
quiet
and
slept
well
that
night
However
during
the
night
Mrs
Wickland
was
greatly
troubled
by
the
presence
of
a
spirit
who
annoyed
her
until
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
she
became
completely
entranced
by
the
spirit
of
the
man
s
former
wife
After
considerable
effort
I
induced
the
spirit
to
talk
but
she
was
with
difficulty
convinced
of
her
real
situation
that
she
was
a
spirit
and
controlling
Mrs
Wickland
s
body
She
strongly
censured
both
her
forrner
husband
and
our
patient
for
their
treachery
to
her
and
repeated
her
threats
against
the
girl
I
will
send
her
to
the
asylum
I
will
kill
her
she
declared
A
great
deal
of
argument
and
persuasion
were
needed
to
bring
the
spirit
to
repentance
but
this
was
at
last
accomplished
Upon
being
asked
if
her
son
was
with
her
she
said
that
she
had
seen
him
at
times
but
that
he
was
dead
and
she
did
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
The
spirit
was
urged
to
leave
the
young
woman
whom
she
was
tormenting
and
go
with
other
spirit
intelligences
to
a
higher
life
of
which
she
showed
herself
entirely
ignorant
Although
repentant
she
still
longed
to
remain
on
the
earth
plane
but
finally
consented
to
leave
and
to
cease
troubling
the
patient
then
she
suddenly
became
weak
and
declared
she
was
dying
This
sensation
often
occurs
when
spirits
realize
their
actual
situation
sometimes
they
again
experience
the
physical
conditions
under
which
they
passed
out
of
their
earth
bodies
Chills
and
violent
attacks
of
coughing
added
to
the
spirit
s
distress
and
after
a
painful
pseudo
death
struggle
she
left
These
symptoms
were
recognized
by
her
husband
and
the
patient
s
mother
as
corresponding
exactly
with
those
manifested
by
the
man
s
wife
at
the
time
of
her
death
from
pneumonia
After
this
the
patient
recovered
rapidly
She
was
soon
able
to
leave
the
Institute
is
now
well
and
happily
married
A
peculiar
case
was
that
of
Mr
Me
a
well
known
man
in
Chicago
whose
family
name
is
one
of
highest
social
prominence
This
man
suddenly
began
to
act
strangely
he
shunned
the
members
of
his
family
and
told
his
wife
and
relatives
that
he
wished
to
live
on
a
higher
plane
and
wanted
nothing
more
to
do
with
them
Then
one
day
he
packed
his
trunk
and
left
home
going
to
live
in
a
small
room
which
he
had
rented
in
the
lowest
section
of
the
city
We
had
never
seen
this
gentleman
but
a
relative
of
his
who
knew
of
our
work
asked
us
to
concentrate
for
him
at
our
next
psychic
circle
we
did
so
and
a
spirit
was
brought
who
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
After
some
solicitation
she
gave
her
full
name
confessing
that
she
had
been
the
first
wife
of
Mr
Me
and
she
then
told
her
story
She
had
met
Mr
Me
in
Chicago
during
the
World
s
Fair
and
for
a
time
they
had
lived
together
without
the
formality
of
marriage
until
his
relatives
discovered
the
situation
and
compelled
them
to
marry
The
girl
was
accepted
in
society
but
rebelled
at
the
restraints
of
conventional
life
and
being
of
a
vain
and
restless
disposition
could
not
live
happily
with
her
husband
She
finally
left
him
and
went
to
the
west
side
where
she
entered
a
house
of
ill
repute
Although
at
times
she
regretted
the
folly
of
her
conduct
she
continued
her
mode
of
living
became
a
morphine
addict
and
finally
committed
suicide
After
her
death
she
had
returned
to
her
husband
and
when
he
married
again
she
felt
angrily
aggrieved
and
at
last
influenced
him
to
leave
his
wife
and
child
to
go
to
quarters
where
she
herself
felt
more
at
home
We
convinced
her
of
the
great
wrong
she
was
doing
in
controlling
her
former
husband
in
this
manner
and
after
she
had
obtained
an
understanding
of
the
progress
awaiting
her
in
the
spirit
world
she
promised
to
leave
wishing
to
attain
a
higher
condition
When
next
we
saw
the
relative
of
Mr
Me
who
had
asked
us
to
concentrate
for
him
we
told
her
of
the
story
related
by
the
spirit
and
in
amazement
she
admitted
it
was
true
in
every
detail
that
the
name
given
was
correct
and
that
Mr
Me
had
been
married
before
but
that
the
unfortunate
episode
had
been
regarded
by
the
family
as
a
skeleton
in
the
closet
and
was
never
mentioned
She
later
reported
that
Mr
Me
had
returned
to
his
home
normal
and
sane
and

CHAPTER
VI
Spirits
and
Crime
HABITS
desires
and
inclinations
are
rooted
in
the
mind
and
remain
with
the
individual
after
he
is
freed
from
his
physical
body
until
they
are
eliminated
by
the
will
The
spirits
of
many
criminals
murderers
those
who
were
executed
or
are
seeking
for
revenge
remain
indefinitely
in
the
earth
sphere
and
often
endeavor
to
continue
their
former
activities
and
to
carry
out
their
evil
designs
through
controlling
the
bodies
of
mortals
who
are
sensitive
to
their
influence
In
many
cases
of
revolting
murder
investigations
will
show
that
the
crimes
were
committed
by
innocent
persons
under
the
control
of
disembodied
spirits
who
had
taken
complete
possession
of
the
murderer
There
is
little
doubt
that
the
murder
of
Stanford
White
by
Harry
K
Thaw
in
at
Madison
Square
Roof
Garden
New
York
was
due
to
spirit
influence
Harry
Thaw
was
a
psychic
sensitive
and
had
shown
evidence
of
this
fact
all
his
life
and
whatever
personal
grievances
he
may
have
had
when
he
killed
Stanford
White
he
was
unquestionably
obsessed
by
avenging
spirits
who
desired
retribution
for
real
or
fancied
injustice
done
to
themselves
or
kindred
Harry
Thaw
was
largely
only
the
psychic
subject
and
the
physical
instrument
through
which
was
enacted
a
terrible
drama
by
the
invisible
world
the
actors
being
ignorant
revengeful
spirits
On
July
several
weeks
after
the
tragedy
occurred
a
strange
spirit
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
during
a
psychic
circle
and
fell
prostrate
to
the
floor
Placing
the
form
of
my
wife
in
a
chair
I
began
questioning
the
controlling
intelligence
The
stranger
strenuously
objected
to
being
touched
brusquely
demanded
to
be
left
alone
and
called
out
Hey
there
waiter
Bring
me
a
drink
What
kind
of
drink
do
you
want
Bring
me
a
whiskey
and
soda
and
be
quick
about
it
Who
are
you
None
of
your
business
who
I
am
Where
do
you
think
you
are
In
Madison
Square
Roof
Garden
of
course
What
is
your
named
Stanford
White
Holding
one
hand
on
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
right
side
and
clutching
at
his
chest
and
abdomen
as
if
in
great
pain
he
cried
Have
a
waiter
bring
me
that
whiskey
and
soda
I
was
about
to
ask
further
questions
when
the
spirit
s
attention
was
attracted
to
some
invisible
and
he
began
to
tremble
with
fear
Are
you
seeing
dead
people
I
asked
He
nodded
his
head
violently
then
shouted
They
are
after
me
and
jumping
from
the
chair
ran
to
a
corner
of
the
room
in
an
effort
to
escape
His
agitation
was
so
great
that
he
lost
control
of
the
psychic
and
was
gone
Immediately
another
spirit
took
possession
of
the
psychic
and
in
great
excitement
began
to
walk
back
and
forth
exclaiming
exultantly
I
killed
the
dog
I
killed
the
dog
There
he
lies
pointing
at
the
floor
toward
the
spot
where
White
had
lost
control
The
dog
I
have
been
looking
for
a
chance
to
kill
him
for
several
years
and
I
got
him
at
last
The
dog
I
forced
the
spirit
to
sit
down
and
learned
that
his
name
was
Johnson
I
killed
Stanford
White
he
boasted
He
deserved
death
He
had
trifled
too
long
with
our
daughters
He
was
very
pronounced
in
his
denunciation
of
society
men
They
steal
our
children
from
us
and
put
fine
clothes
on
them
and
the
parents
do
not
know
what
becomes
of
them
I
asked
the
spirit
whether
he
was
aware
of
being
dead
but
he
laughed
at
the
idea
and
said
How
could
a
dead
person
talk
The
doctor
said
I
had
consumption
and
would
die
soon
but
I
didn
t
die
I
never
felt
better
in
my
life
When
asked
to
carefully
examine
his
hands
feet
and
dress
he
demanded
to
know
how
he
a
man
became
possessed
of
a
woman
s
body
Lengthy
argument
finally
convinced
the
perplexed
spirit
of
the
fact
of
his
transition
and
he
departed
thoroughly
penitent
He
was
followed
by
a
third
entity
but
this
intelligence
was
aware
of
being
a
spirit
temporarily
controlling
a
borrowed
body
I
am
Harry
Thaw
s
father
Save
my
boy
Save
my
boy
He
is
not
guilty
Harry
will
not
be
electrocuted
Later
events
proved
this
to
be
true
He
is
sensitive
to
spirit
influence
and
has
been
all
his
life
He
was
always
erratic
and
so
excitable
that
we
were
afraid
to
correct
him
for
fear
he
would
become
insane
But
I
see
our
mistake
now
I
did
not
understand
the
cause
of
Harry
s
queer
actions
while
I
was
in
the
physical
but
now
from
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
can
see
that
Harry
has
been
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
selfish
earthbound
spirits
most
of
his
life
He
was
obsessed
by
revengeful
spirits
when
he
killed
Stanford
White
I
have
tried
to
reach
the
external
world
by
every
possible
avenue
to
tell
the
people
that
Harry
is
not
insane
but
that
he
is
a
psychic
sensitive
Save
my
boy
Save
my
boy
he
begged
repeatedly
What
would
you
have
us
do
Please
write
to
my
wife
and
to
my
attorney
Mr
Olcott
We
did
not
then
know
that
Mr
Olcott
had
been
Mr
Thaw
s
attorney
but
verified
the
fact
afterward
Tell
them
your
experience
and
what
I
have
said
to
you
and
urge
them
to
recognize
and
understand
Harry
s
condition
We
promised
to
comply
with
the
wish
of
the
spirit
and
he
then
departed
The
following
evening
July
another
spirit
came
he
seemed
at
first
to
be
looking
for
some
one
then
asked
Where
did
the
other
fellows
go
This
spirit
also
condemned
high
society
in
general
and
denounced
young
girls
in
particular
for
their
foolishness
The
rich
take
our
girls
to
their
dens
they
put
them
on
the
stage
and
the
girls
disown
their
parents
They
deserve
licking
he
declared
and
emphasized
his
words
with
suitable
gestures
This
spirit
was
laboring
under
such
great
mental
excitement
that
he
suddenly
lost
control
before
I
could
ascertain
any
particulars
On
February
the
spirit
of
Mr
Thaw
returned
and
reiterated
his
statement
that
Harry
was
a
psychic
sensitive
who
was
frequently
subject
to
the
influence
of
mischievous
spirits
He
also
urged
upon
humanity
the
great
need
for
inquiry
into
the
subject
of
spirit
influence
saying
that
a
proper
understanding
would
prevent
untold
misery
to
both
spirits
and
their
unfortunate
mortal
victims
That
Richard
Ivens
hung
for
the
murder
of
Mrs
Bessie
Hollister
in
Chicago
was
a
victim
of
foreign
influences
was
so
evident
that
alienists
criminologists
and
psychologists
alike
declared
their
belief
that
Ivens
was
innocent
and
that
he
had
confessed
the
crime
under
the
hypnotic
suggestion
of
some
unknown
person
Ivens
would
alternately
confess
his
guilt
saying
with
a
strange
trance
like
stare
that
a
big
man
had
compelled
him
to
commit
the
deed
and
then
again
wildly
deny
it
Hugo
Munsterburg
M
D
Professor
of
Psychology
Harvard
University
wrote
in
June
It
is
an
interesting
and
yet
rather
clear
case
of
dissociation
and
auto
suggestion
The
witches
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
burned
on
account
of
similar
confessions
and
the
popular
understanding
of
mental
aberrations
has
not
made
much
progress
since
that
time
Professor
William
James
of
Harvard
wrote
Whether
guilty
or
not
Ivens
must
have
been
in
a
state
of
dissociated
personality
He
was
not
his
natural
self
during
those
fateful
first
days
but
the
victim
of
one
of
those
rare
alterations
of
personality
either
suggested
or
spontaneous
which
are
now
well
known
to
occur
in
predisposed
subjects
We
present
a
sequel
to
this
tragic
story
EXPERIENCE
MARCH
Spirit
RICHARD
IVENS
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
When
the
spirit
assumed
control
the
psychic
fell
to
the
floor
apparently
lifeless
and
only
after
half
an
hour
of
strenuous
effort
was
the
intelligence
brought
to
consciousness
Leave
me
alone
he
moaned
do
you
want
to
hang
me
again
He
complained
of
having
great
pain
in
the
neck
and
begged
to
be
left
undisturbed
saying
he
wanted
only
to
sleep
What
is
the
trouble
with
your
neck
It
is
broken
They
hanged
me
and
I
am
dead
I
want
to
remain
dead
if
you
bring
me
to
life
they
will
hang
me
again
What
is
your
name
Richard
Ivens
Were
you
guilty
of
the
murder
of
Mrs
Hollister
I
do
not
know
Others
said
I
was
If
I
did
it
I
do
not
know
it
Why
did
you
plead
guilty
at
times
and
then
again
deny
your
confession
I
pleaded
guilty
because
those
three
fellows
spirits
made
me
The
big
man
stood
over
me
with
a
knife
and
threatened
to
kill
me
if
I
would
not
plead
guilty
When
the
big
man
was
not
there
I
told
them
that
I
did
not
know
whether
I
killed
the
lady
or
not
I
told
it
to
the
police
I
told
it
to
the
jailer
and
to
everybody
that
questioned
me
but
they
would
not
believe
me
when
I
told
them
the
truth
I
have
suffered
so
much
Why
did
you
call
me
back
when
I
was
dead
Why
didn
t
you
let
me
sleep
They
will
arrest
me
and
hang
me
again
Suddenly
the
spirit
shouted
with
fright
Don
t
you
see
There
is
that
big
man
again
He
has
his
knife
and
the
two
short
fellows
are
with
him
Oh
Clutching
his
knee
he
cried
My
knee
He
has
driven
the
knife
through
my
knee
and
through
the
other
leg
My
leg
My
leg
He
is
the
devil
He
has
stabbed
me
The
terrified
spirit
was
gradually
made
to
understand
that
his
tormentors
were
spirits
that
he
was
free
from
his
physical
body
and
beyond
the
power
of
bodily
harm
You
are
using
a
body
not
your
own
and
need
now
to
free
yourself
from
all
mental
delusions
Do
you
not
see
other
spirits
beside
your
enemies
Why
yes
there
are
others
now
they
seem
to
be
friendly
and
there
there
s
Mrs
Hollister
Ask
the
man
with
the
knife
why
he
hounds
you
I
suggested
He
only
grins
Ask
him
why
he
wanted
to
kill
the
lady
He
says
because
he
hates
women
he
stopped
abruptly
and
breathless
seemed
to
be
watching
a
scene
of
great
disturbance
They
have
taken
those
devils
away
It
was
a
lively
fight
but
they
got
them
Calming
himself
he
said
I
feel
better
now
I
am
so
glad
that
terrible
man
is
gone
Asked
to
recall
what
he
could
of
the
Hollister
tragedy
he
said
When
I
saw
the
woman
that
night
I
also
saw
the
big
man
My
head
began
to
feel
very
strange
I
was
grabbed
by
the
throat
and
lost
consciousness
When
I
came
to
myself
again
the
big
man
said
that
I
had
killed
the
woman
I
had
known
the
man
for
about
a
month
but
I
did
not
know
he
was
a
spirit
He
has
been
hounding
me
ever
since
Why
didn
t
they
give
me
a
chance
to
live
even
if
I
would
have
been
in
prison
Oh
the
shame
I
have
brought
upon
my
family
I
feel
so
sorry
for
my
poor
mother
if
she
could
only
know
the
truth
If
I
could
only
speak
to
her
and
tell
her
that
I
could
not
help
it
that
I
did
not
do
it
Nobody
had
any
sympathy
for
me
and
nobody
would
believe
me
when
I
told
them
about
the
big
fellow
standing
over
me
with
the
knife
He
made
me
plead
guilty
If
I
committed
the
crime
I
am
sorry
for
it
but
I
don
t
know
that
I
have
done
it
Why
did
they
kill
me
After
I
had
explained
the
continuity
of
life
and
progression
into
higher
spiritual
realms
he
eagerly
asked
If
they
did
not
kill
me
is
the
lady
still
alive
also
Certainly
doubtless
she
has
come
here
to
forgive
you
Although
you
destroyed
her
physical
body
you
were
not
responsible
for
the
act
you
were
merely
used
by
wicked
spirits
who
hypnotized
you
With
this
new
understanding
the
weary
spirit
was
taken
in
charge
by
invisible
helpers
who
told
us
that
the
Big
Man
and
his
accomplices
had
in
earth
life
belonged
to
a
band
of
White
Caps
which
had
operated
extensively
for
some
years
in
England
and
America
mutilating
and
killing
many
women
in
their
criminal
mania
Several
months
later
the
spirit
of
the
Big
Man
himself
was
brought
to
our
circle
EXPERIENCE
JUNE
Spirit
CHARLES
THE
FIGHTER
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
The
spirit
seemed
stupefied
by
drink
and
when
finally
aroused
was
so
pugnacious
that
the
aid
of
several
persons
was
required
to
quiet
him
I
m
Charles
The
Fighter
and
I
ll
have
you
all
shot
he
shouted
Turning
to
some
other
invisibles
he
cursed
them
for
having
lured
him
to
this
place
and
commanded
them
to
help
him
instead
of
standing
idly
by
Subdued
at
last
Charles
The
Fighter
was
compelled
to
listen
to
an
elucidation
of
his
real
situation
In
an
endeavor
to
convince
him
that
he
was
controlling
the
body
of
another
he
was
asked
to
examine
the
hands
of
the
psychic
Seeing
the
hand
of
a
woman
he
shrank
back
terror
stricken
and
cried
Take
that
hand
away
Take
it
away
I
don
t
want
to
see
it
any
more
Questioned
regarding
the
story
of
the
hand
he
declared
I
shall
never
tell
I
would
rather
die
Oh
There
is
her
face
too
And
the
hand
that
I
cut
off
to
get
the
diamond
ring
They
haunted
me
all
this
time
Looking
about
in
horror
he
seemed
to
see
a
vast
gathering
of
specters
See
all
those
faces
Have
I
killed
all
those
people
Have
they
come
to
accuse
me
There
There
is
that
boy
He
was
hung
once
but
he
seems
to
be
after
me
too
Ivens
I
killed
the
woman
but
I
made
him
confess
to
save
my
own
neck
But
just
wait
you
devil
you
I
will
fix
you
when
I
get
out
of
this
I
will
cut
you
all
to
pieces
But
at
last
Charles
The
Fighter
realized
that
further
resistance
was
useless
and
that
his
days
of
robbery
and
murder
were
over
He
told
of
his
hideous
career
of
crime
and
said
that
he
murdered
for
revenge
stole
to
buy
whiskey
and
drank
to
drown
his
conscience
and
to
escape
the
specters
which
constantly
haunted
him
In
early
childhood
he
had
been
happy
under
the
care
of
his
own
mother
but
after
her
death
his
stepmother
had
abused
him
so
mercilessly
that
he
often
rushed
sobbing
to
his
room
and
on
his
knees
prayed
to
his
dead
mother
for
help
This
roused
the
stepmother
to
a
jealous
fury
and
regardless
of
the
protests
of
a
weak
father
she
had
beaten
him
angrily
forbidding
him
to
ever
mention
the
name
of
his
mother
again
Her
abuse
grew
into
such
a
cruel
tyranny
that
the
boy
had
developed
an
over
powering
hatred
for
her
and
revengefully
vowed
that
when
he
was
grown
he
would
kill
every
woman
possible
Consistently
he
had
carried
out
his
ghastly
purpose
and
had
given
his
entire
life
to
plotting
and
perpetrating
atrocities
and
crimes
generally
victimizing
women
Ile
had
died
in
during
a
wild
fight
with
his
companions
but
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
loss
of
his
physical
body
He
boasted
that
for
many
years
he
had
continued
his
crimes
always
eluding
the
police
Once
in
Boston
I
wanted
to
kill
a
policeman
but
when
I
sneaked
up
behind
him
and
hit
him
on
the
head
with
a
club
the
club
went
right
through
him
and
never
hurt
him
He
didn
t
even
turn
around
The
spirit
thought
himself
now
in
the
hands
of
authorities
but
declared
that
he
was
willing
to
give
himself
up
to
escape
the
haunting
faces
of
his
many
victims
I
would
be
glad
to
go
to
bell
to
get
away
from
this
torment
While
listening
to
an
explanation
of
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
and
the
conditions
prevailing
in
the
spirit
world
Charles
saw
his
own
mother
standing
before
him
The
sight
of
her
had
an
overwhelming
effect
the
hardened
criminal
cowered
in
his
seat
and
wept
piteously
while
his
mother
pleaded
with
him
to
come
with
her
and
learn
to
expiate
his
crimes
I
Crushed
by
guilt
and
remorse
he
cried
abjectly
I
cannot
go
with
you
Dear
mother
don
t
ask
me
to
go
with
you
You
must
go
back
to
Heaven
and
I
must
go
to
hell
where
I
belong
I
must
be
cut
to
pieces
and
burned
in
the
fires
of
hell
But
maternal
love
prevailed
and
the
spirit
humble
and
penitent
followed
his
mother
in
Harry
Hayward
a
handsome
reprobate
with
a
weakness
for
beautiful
women
and
a
life
of
gaiety
hired
a
villain
to
murder
his
sweetheart
in
Minnesota
and
was
hanged
While
he
was
in
prison
awaiting
execution
he
maintained
his
debonair
attitude
to
the
last
played
cards
with
his
jailer
with
the
utmost
nonchalance
and
ordered
ice
cream
his
favorite
dish
whenever
possible
When
you
come
to
hell
where
I
am
going
he
told
the
jailer
I
am
going
to
treat
you
to
ice
cream
During
this
time
I
anonymously
sent
him
a
book
and
several
papers
relating
to
the
spirit
world
but
otherwise
had
no
connection
with
him
On
February
a
nurse
asked
us
to
concentrate
for
Mrs
McA
a
patient
whom
she
was
attending
arid
whose
case
strongly
suggested
psychic
invalidism
chronic
illness
and
lassitude
due
to
spirit
obsession
The
nurse
was
a
psychic
sensitive
herself
and
surmised
that
many
of
the
uncontrollable
notions
of
her
beautiful
patient
were
caused
by
spirit
obsession
and
had
several
times
endeavored
to
order
any
intruder
away
One
day
Mrs
McA
developed
an
intense
desire
for
homemade
ice
cream
although
ordinarily
she
did
not
care
in
the
least
for
it
But
she
insisted
that
her
whim
be
satisfied
at
once
putting
her
maids
to
a
great
deal
of
inconvenience
When
the
nurse
entered
the
room
with
the
ice
cream
she
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
some
one
had
rushed
upon
her
and
the
next
instant
was
seized
by
so
strong
a
feeling
of
choking
that
she
was
forced
to
leave
the
room
Upon
recovery
she
returned
and
convinced
of
the
presence
of
a
spirit
flung
a
window
open
and
silently
ordered
any
foreign
entity
present
to
leave
the
house
This
nurse
and
Mrs
McA
s
maid
attended
our
circle
that
evening
and
the
controlling
spirit
at
once
complained
of
pain

the
neck
readily
explaining
that
his
neck
had
been
broken
when
Ile
was
hung
and
said
his
name
was
Harry
Hayward
Can
t
you
give
me
some
ice
cream
I
have
tried
and
tried
to
get
some
and
today
I
could
almost
taste
it
but
I
couldn
t
quite
get
it
I
was
chased
away
by
a
woman
she
threw
me
out
of
the
window
I
don
t
like
to
be
thrown
out
of
a
window
by
a
woman
Hayward
realized
that
he
was
hovering
around
the
earth
as
a
spirit
and
when
we
inquired
how
he
had
learned
about
spirit
life
he
replied
that
while
he
was
in
jail
he
had
read
of
it
in
some
literature
which
had
been
sent
him
by
an
unknown
person
He
complained
that
no
matter
where
he
went
no
one
would
take
any
notice
of
him
when
he
took
a
seat
in
a
train
some
one
would
come
along
and
sit
down
on
his
lap
and
he
would
be
powerless
to
move
He
was
very
pleased
to
be
able
to
converse
with
people
again
and
asked
many
questions
about
the
various
persons
concerned
with
his
trial
and
execution
inquiring
particularly
about
the
guard
with
whom
he
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
playing
cards
I
was
under
the
impression
that
this
guard
had
died
some
time
before
and
informed
the
spirit
so
suggesting
that
possibly
he
might
be
able
to
see
him
in
the
spirit
world
He
was
silent
a
moment
endeavoring
to
trace
his
former
friend
then
said
emphatically
No
that
man
is
not
dead
I
see
him
playing
cards
at
his
son
s
home
in
Minneapolis
Hayward
was
readily
enlightened
concerning
the
higher
life
and
left
expressing
a
willingness
to
progress
in
the
spirit
world
The
psychic
invalid
showed
marked
changes
for
the
better
after
this
and
subsequent
correspondence
proved
Hayward
s
statement
about
the
old
guard
to
be
true
The
latter
was
living
and
on
the
evening
of
our
experience
with
Hayward
had
been
playing
cards
in
his
son
s
home
Ten
years
later
after
the
spirit
of
another
murderer
who
was
hung
had
been
in
our
circle
Hayward
returned
and
told
something
of
his
earth
life
EXPERIENCE

HARRY
HAYWARD
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
think
I
should
like
to
come
in
and
say
something
for
I
feel
I
have
been
in
the
same
boat
as
the
fellow
who
preceded
me
I
mean
on
the
same
platform
I
feel
but
little
better
than
he
I
had
a
little
more
understanding
than
he
had
and
therefore
my
punishment
was
a
little
harder
I
had
education
and
all
the
money
I
needed
but
I
wanted
more
I
also
want
to
tell
you
that
since
I
have
come
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
have
wished
I
could
go
on
every
street
corner
and
shout
a
message
to
mothers
not
to
raise
their
children
in
the
wrong
way
Mothers
say
they
love
their
children
they
worship
them
and
they
let
them
go
astray
because
they
cannot
say
No
to
them
Do
not
raise
children
without
discipline
Train
children
as
you
train
animals
as
you
train
flowers
If
you
plant
a
flower
in
your
garden
you
don
t
want
it
to
grow
up
wild
but
you
train
it
so
that
it
will
grow
successfully
and
have
graceful
flowers
But
how
little
does
humanity
think
of
the
children
s
growth
and
training
children
are
not
trained
to
become
blossoms
for
humanity
I
tell
you
if
my
mother
I
do
not
condemn
her
by
any
means
had
trained
me
properly
so
that
she
could
have
said
No
to
me
instead
of
worshipping
me
and
letting
me
have
all
the
money
I
wanted
and
if
she
had
punished
me
when
I
did
wrong
I
would
have
been
different
No
I
would
not
have
been
hung
if
my
mother
had
taught
me
the
beautiful
lesson
of
living
for
others
and
of
loving
my
fellow
man
as
myself
If
mothers
would
think
of
their
children
s
welfare
and
raise
them
in
the
beautiful
thought
of
living
for
others
they
would
all
be
better
I
lived
a
very
sporty
life
Nobody
taught
me
any
other
I
had
a
very
good
time
and
I
liked
the
girls
pretty
well
but
there
came
a
time
when
I
spent
more
money
than
my
father
allowed
me
to
have
I
was
only
a
young
man
and
I
should
have
been
made
to
work
My
misfortune
was
that
my
mother
and
father
were
rich
Work
was
a
disgrace
for
me
they
thought
It
would
have
been
far
better
if
they
had
put
me
to
work
instead
of
giving
me
money
each
time
I
asked
for
it
I
commenced
to
gamble
You
know
when
you
get
into
that
game
it
is
hard
to
quit
Money
came
too
easy
for
me
I
met
a
young
lady
whom
I
liked
Young
girls
always
were
sweet
to
me
and
I
was
able
to
have
whoever
I
wanted
The
young
lady
liked
me
and
I
liked
her
for
what
I
got
from
her
so
we
decided
that
she
would
insure
herself
for
in
my
name
I
had
a
scheme
If
somebody
killed
her
I
would
not
get
the
blame
but
I
would
get
the
money
I
laid
a
bold
scheme
I
hired
a
man
to
kill
her
At
the
time
the
deed
was
to
be
committed
I
took
another
girl
to
the
theater
because
I
thought
that
whatever
happened
blame
could
not
then
be
attached
to
me
I
hired
a
man
to
take
her
for
a
buggy
ride
out
to
Lake
Calhoun
and
he
was
to
kill
her
When
they
got
to
the
woods
the
man
killed
her
and
came
home
Being
in
the
theater
the
girl
I
was
with
could
testify
I
was
not
at
the
scene
of
the
killing
but
you
know
I
was
so
crazy
to
get
hold
of
the
insurance
money
that
I
never
thought
how
it
looked
to
go
to
the
insurance
office
so
soon
after
the
death
and
they
became
suspicious
and
finally
caught
me
If
I
had
only
waited
a
week
or
two
they
would
never
have
surmised
anything
about
me
I
was
arrested
My
mother
loved
me
so
much
that
she
tried
to
put
the
blame
on
my
other
brother
He
was
married
and
had
two
children
The
trial
cost
my
parents
a
whole
lot
of
money
and
lasted
months
and
months
before
they
could
make
any
headway
They
could
not
decide
whether
it
was
Eddie
or
I
that
should
be
hung
for
the
deed
One
day
while
I
was
in
jail
there
came
a
little
pamphlet
for
me
and
some
papers
all
about
the
spirit
world
I
knew
I
had
to
go
for
finally
I
had
been
sentenced
to
be
hung
I
realized
my
trouble
The
papers
interested
me
very
much
and
I
thought
I
should
like
to
know
what
the
spirit
world
was
I
believed
in
it
in
a
way
and
in
another
way
I
didn
t
The
doctrine
was
better
than
the
church
had
taught
but
for
a
while
I
treated
it
more
as
a
joke
I
talked
about
it
quite
a
little
to
the
watchman
but
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
be
hung
I
shrank
from
it
It
is
a
very
strange
sensation
when
you
think
you
are
going
to
the
gallows
and
your
life
will
be
snapped
out
you
cannot
imagine
how
it
feels
You
cannot
imagine
the
sensation
you
have
when
you
realize
that
you
have
only
a
few
hours
to
live
Still
the
little
message
which
had
been
sent
to
me
gave
me
a
little
courage
and
I
thought
probably
only
my
body
would
be
destroyed
and
not
my
spirit
So
at
the
last
moment
I
kept
up
my
courage
and
felt
that
I
wanted
to
see
What
the
hereafter
was
I
have
to
thank
the
one
who
sent
me
that
pamphlet
because
it
was
a
bright
cheerful
spot
to
me
at
the
last
of
my
days
When
I
realized
that
I
had
passed
out
of
my
body
my
first
thought
was
I
am
not
dead
I
went
to
my
mother
and
I
spoke
to
her
and
she
felt
my
presence
I
still
clung
to
my
body
however
and
I
felt
I
could
not
leave
it
I
got
out
of
it
quickly
but
I
went
back
to
it
again
When
my
body
was
cremated
I
stood
by
and
saw
it
burned
After
that
I
walked
around
but
I
could
not
find
the
spirit
world
I
walked
and
walked
from
one
place
to
another
I
still
had
my
feeling
for
nice
pretty
women
so
I
traveled
In
a
way
I
realized
that
I
was
dead
yet
I
did
not
fully
realize
it
One
time
I
felt
I
would
like
to
take
a
journey
and
I
wanted
to
travel
by
train
I
went
to
the
ticket
office
to
get
a
ticket
but
I
had
no
money
I
thought
I
would
talk
to
the
agent
nicely
and
he
would
give
me
a
ticket
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
So
I
thought
All
right
I
m
going
on
the
train
anyway
so
on
I
got
I
sat
down
on
one
of
the
seats
and
before
I
knew
it
a
great
big
fat
man
sat
right
down
on
my
lap
I
got
real
mad
I
tried
to
push
him
off
but
I
could
not
and
I
could
not
get
up
either
I
had
to
let
that
man
sit
on
me
until
he
was
ready
to
get
off
the
train
I
had
not
learned
the
power
of
thought
to
think
myself
away
I
had
only
learned
to
walk
I
had
not
yet
learned
the
little
thought
lesson
to
think
myself
in
a
place
in
order
to
be
there
Before
long
I
came
to
a
beautiful
lady
Mrs
McA
and
I
commenced
to
like
her
Before
I
knew
it
I
was
in
her
magnetic
aura
and
I
could
not
get
away
She
wanted
to
be
in
bed
all
the
time
and
there
I
was
Once
I
heard
some
one
say
You
must
leave
this
lady
and
go
away
if
there
is
any
spirit
around
her
it
must
leave
and
go
away
I
was
there
however
I
was
very
fond
of
ice
cream
and
I
wanted
some
so
I
impressed
the
lady
to
ask
for
it
When
it
was
brought
in
I
wanted
it
I
seemed
to
come
in
contact
with
the
lady
who
was
carrying
it
and
I
felt
that
if
I
could
only
get
a
good
hold
of
her
I
would
get
the
cream
All
at
once
I
was
a
lady
myself
and
when
I
tried
to
get
that
ice
cream
I
had
the
same
sensation
that
had
when
I
was
hung
But
the
lady
who
was
carrying
the
ice
cream
had
such
power
that
before
I
knew
it
she
had
thrown
me
out
of
the
window
bodily
mind
you
I
have
to
thank
you
for
delivering
me
from
all
that
trouble
and
also
want
to
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
the
sermon
you
gave
me
at
that
time
which
helped
me
to
an
understanding
of
the
beautiful
world
beyond
I
wish
again
that
I
could
stand
on
every
street
corner
and
tell
the
mothers
to
raise
their
children
to
be
good
men
and
women
and
when
necessary
punish
them
while
they
are
little
and
not
spare
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child
If
mothers
raised
their
children
properly
there
would
not
be
the
selfishness
there
is
in
the
world
I
have
a
nice
little
home
in
the
spirit
world
now
and
I
have
much
to
do
for
my
work
is
not
yet
done
I
am
trying
to
extend
help
to
all
those
who
wish
help
I
thank
you
for
enlightening
me
in
the
first
place

PETE

Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
want
to
come
here
tonight
to
tell
you
that
I
also
am
one
who
is
very
thankful
to
you
although
you
probably
do
not
care
whether
I
come
again
or
not
But
I
do
know
you
helped
me
to
something
like
happiness
which
I
thought
never
could
be
mine
I
was
nothing
but
a
wild
beast
in
earth
life
but
still
when
you
do
not
give
children
proper
training
how
can
you
expect
to
have
good
men
I
had
no
training
at
all
My
mother
was
very
wild
and
did
not
care
what
became
of
her
children
She
thought
Let
them
take
care
of
themselves
So
you
go
out
in
company
with
others
and
get
into
first
one
game
then
another
Sometimes
you
go
to
church
I
didn
t
believe
in
that
old
story
about
Christ
I
could
not
believe
it
and
I
thought
there
was
no
such
thing
as
what
they
taught
about
Christ
and
if
there
was
what
did
I
care
I
walked
in
the
path
of
evil
from
the
time
I
was
a
little
boy
until
I
got
where
I
could
not
live
any
longer
whether
I
wanted
to
or
not
I
will
tell
you
if
you
have
children
please
give
them
an
understanding
when
they
are
little
If
they
take
anything
from
a
person
make
them
take
it
back
where
they
got
it
Don
t
let
them
get
the
idea
that
you
will
take
it
from
them
and
think
it
is
all
right
If
they
steal
once
they
will
again
if
not
properly
taught
When
I
stole
my
mother
thought
I
was
a
smart
boy
I
kept
on
going
from
bad
to
worse
I
belonged
to
a
gang
of
about
a
dozen
boys
We
got
so
bold
and
desperate
that
we
did
not
care
what
became
of
us
We
got
into
all
kinds
of
hold
ups
and
the
more
we
got
into
the
better
we
liked
it
At
last
we
held
up
and
killed
people
The
result
was
that
we
were
caught
and
hung
I
am
Neidemeyer
and
here
I
am
Years
ago
I
was
brought
to
this
circle
through
our
neighbor
girl
I
liked
that
girl
very
much
One
day
she
went
away
from
home
and
I
thought
I
would
go
with
her
I
did
nut
realize
that
I
had
been
hung
I
did
not
realize
that
I
was
dead
I
had
gone
home
and
had
stayed
there
for
a
long
time
but
I
did
not
know
that
I
was
dead
My
mother
was
a
strange
woman
but
from
what
I
have
seen
since
I
came
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
realize
that
she
was
obsessed
Nobody
could
do
anything
with
my
mother
My
father
and
my
brother
were
very
good
people
but
my
mother
and
I
were
the
black
ones
This
neighbor
girl
was
good
and
she
always
tried
to
do
the
best
for
me
that
she
could
The
day
I
followed
her
she
went
to
this
man
s
house
Dr
W
and
she
went
into
a
little
room
and
spoke
with
the
psychic
through
whom
I
am
talking
now
and
I
saw
things
that
day
that
I
had
never
seen
before
I
did
not
know
what
they
meant
Somebody
seemed
to
keep
me
there
and
I
could
not
get
away
Before
I
knew
much
I
was
sitting
in
a
little
meeting
I
heard
singing
and
before
I
realized
it
I
was
full
of
life
again
I
could
talk
and
my
throat
did
not
hurt
me
any
more
I
began
to
wonder
what
had
happened
to
me
You
talked
to
me
so
kindly
that
it
helped
me
You
talked
to
me
about
the
real
life
on
the
other
side
You
helped
me
to
an
understanding
of
life
not
what
the
church
and
ministers
taught
that
we
should
pray
to
God
and
believe
in
the
blood
of
Christ
and
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
and
that
if
we
believe
that
we
will
go
to
Heaven
I
was
not
the
kind
that
could
go
on
that
straight
road
because
I
felt
that
was
too
easy
and
I
couldn
t
believe
that
we
could
get
to
Heaven
without
any
effort
on
our
part
I
knew
I
was
bad
yet
I
felt
in
my
heart
that
I
should
do
something
to
try
and
be
good
and
do
good
for
what
I
had
done
bad
The
thought
of
that
seemed
to
be
more
reasonable
than
that
of
jumping
from
my
bad
condition
right
into
Heaven
I
thought
I
would
not
be
a
very
good
example
either
You
commenced
to
talk
to
me
about
the
philosophy
of
God
in
a
way
I
had
never
heard
before
and
it
appealed
to
my
sense
I
hope
somebody
will
talk
in
that
way
to
my
fellow
men
who
are
in
the
condition
I
was
It
would
touch
their
hearts
There
are
many
of
them
who
are
not
bad
but
nobody
cares
for
them
The
majority
of
them
do
not
believe
in
the
Jesus
Christ
story
As
they
are
now
they
are
going
to
the
dogs
Since
I
came
to
this
little
circle
the
first
time
and
received
help
I
have
had
my
struggles
It
is
years
since
I
made
my
first
appearance
here
I
want
to
tell
you
what
I
have
to
do
since
my
mother
passed
out
I
have
tried
and
tried
to
bring
her
to
an
understanding
of
the
truth
but
she
will
not
listen
I
hope
some
day
to
be
able
to
awaken
her
to
a
higher
condition
As
we
progress
we
go
from
circle
to
circle
If
I
believed
that
Christ
died
for
my
sins
that
belief
and
creed
would
keep
me
out
of
the
higher
spirit
world
When
I
had
passed
out
of
my
body
you
told
me
that
I
should
look
for
spirit
friends
who
would
help
me
and
that
my
first
lesson
would
be
to
serve
others
I
have
had
a
very
hard
time
The
first
thing
I
had
to
do
was
to
conquer
self
and
it
is
very
hard
to
conquer
selfishness
when
you
have
never
thought
of
anything
else
but
selfishness
We
must
conquer
that
before
we
can
do
any
work
at
all
in
the
spirit
world
The
best
way
is
to
be
put
in
a
dark
room
we
sometimes
call
it
a
dungeon
where
we
see
nothing
but
ourselves
and
our
acts
of
the
past
One
after
another
these
acts
come
crowding
in
The
good
ones
are
so
few
that
they
hardly
count
for
anything
When
we
do
see
a
good
act
it
seems
as
if
it
belongs
to
some
one
else
We
have
to
stay
there
until
our
hearts
and
eyes
are
opened
When
we
seek
to
overcome
our
bad
habits
and
to
live
for
others
then
we
get
out
of
the
selfish
state
My
heart
was
very
hardened
but
finally
I
cried
out
Not
my
will
any
longer
but
thine
The
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
help
serve
the
very
lowest
we
come
in
contact
with
I
felt
that
I
did
not
want
to
assist
with
this
or
that
but
I
had
to
I
had
to
learn
patience
When
we
can
serve
without
grumbling
and
do
it
for
the
love
of
our
fellow
man
it
does
not
seem
so
hard
So
I
have
gone
on
and
on
from
one
thing
to
another
always
learning
and
through
learning
I
have
stepped
into
a
more
beautiful
condition
In
the
invisible
world
we
advance
by
stages
but
only
through
learning
I
want
to
thank
you
tonight
for
the
help
you
have
given
me
I
have
a
beautiful
little
home
in
the
spirit
world
by
this
time
and
I
am
happy
but
my
work
is
not
done
yet
My
work
is
to
keep
on
helping
those
who
need
help
and
to
try
to
influence
the
boys
on
earth
not
to
do
the
mischief
they
Are
planning
but
to
try
to
be
good
and
do
the
very
best
they
know
how
for
their
fellow
men
Goodbye

PETE
NEIDEMEYER
Psychie
MRS
WICKLAND
I
should
like
to
come
here
tonight
to
say
a
few
words
I
want
to
thank
you
for
helping
me
to
the
higher
life
I
had
gone
down
down
and
had
only
hatred
and
selfish
thoughts
I
was
down
as
far
as
I
could
go
My
mother
was
obsessed
She
had
a
great
deal
of
influence
over
me
She
was
down
on
the
world
and
made
me
do
things
to
the
neighbors
that
I
should
never
have
done
My
father
and
brother
were
good
people
and
were
looked
up
to
I
am
Pete
Neidemeyer
I
want
to
thank
you
for
having
helped
me
and
now
I
want
to
ask
you
to
send
good
thoughts
to
my
mother
She
has
passed
out
but
I
cannot
reach
her
She
was
obsessed
by
a
very
evil
spirit
she
sent
evil
thoughts
to
me
and
I
was
very
sensitive
to
them
You
did
a
Christian
act
for
me
which
no
one
else
had
ever
done
I
was
shunned
by
all
When
you
are
in
a
large
city
with
all
its
temptations
and
have
not
learned
anything
about
the
higher
things
you
get
in
bad
company
You
get
so
wrapped
up
with
things
that
are
bad
that
you
think
everything
belongs
to
you
just
as
much
as
it
does
to
the
other
fellow
Jealousy
selfishness
and
ignorance
are
three
things
that
we
should
all
try
to
conquer
When
they
get
hold
of
you
they
are
the
devil
in
you
You
feel
jealous
of
everybody
that
has
more
than
you
You
are
selfish
You
don
t
want
to
give
anything
away
you
just
want
to
keep
it
all
for
yourself
You
want
everything
that
belongs
to
others
You
feel
that
if
there
is
a
God
he
should
have
given
you
a
chance
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
In
that
atmosphere
I
was
brought
up
Mother
was
selfish
and
jealous
Nobody
in
the
neighborhood
liked
her
she
did
not
have
one
friend
I
was
her
pet
and
I
could
have
anything
Father
told
me
not
to
do
bad
things
but
mother
said
not
to
mind
what
he
told
me
but
to
go
ahead
and
do
as
I
pleased
I
went
out
and
stayed
out
nights
in
bad
company
We
got
a
gang
together
I
did
not
mean
to
get
into
the
gang
as
I
did
but
I
was
forced
into
it
by
the
club
You
understand
they
have
clubs
secret
clubs
those
fellows
and
when
you
join
you
have
to
do
just
what
they
say
because
you
are
in
their
power
If
you
try
to
withdraw
you
cannot
because
they
will
squeal
on
you
They
watch
you
and
somebody
follows
you
all
the
time
The
new
beginners
are
the
ones
who
do
the
dirty
work
The
leaders
very
seldom
get
caught
There
is
a
school
and
the
new
beginners
learn
to
do
bad
things
Some
of
the
leaders
are
in
the
finest
society
in
big
cities
and
they
get
to
know
where
we
can
find
people
to
rob
You
may
sometimes
wonder
how
we
know
where
to
go
to
find
jewelry
and
money
Our
leaders
know
all
about
it
They
are
in
fine
society
all
the
time
They
have
money
so
it
wouldn
t
do
any
good
to
squeal
on
them
If
I
should
tell
you
the
names
of
some
of
our
leaders
who
are
in
society
in
Chicago
you
would
not
believe
me
You
would
say
that
it
is
not
so
If
you
would
tell
on
them
they
would
at
once
squeal
on
you
and
say
you
robbed
such
a
house
What
could
you
do
You
just
have
to
keep
still
That
is
what
the
underworld
is
doing
The
upper
world
uses
the
underworld
when
it
suits
its
purpose
What
we
steal
in
one
city
they
send
off
to
another
city
Always
you
will
find
our
leaders
in
the
finest
society
but
we
do
not
dare
say
anything
When
you
once
join
their
club
what
I
would
call
the
Devil
s
Club
you
can
t
say
anything
You
are
in
their
claws
and
our
leaders
are
worse
than
devils
they
are
so
mean
If
we
should
kill
we
are
the
ones
who
suffer
but
they
get
the
money
I
came
here
tonight
to
thank
you
for
having
helped
me
Nobody
ever
gave
me
a
helping
hand
before
In
that
car
barn
murder
I
did
not
kill
any
one
I
was
with
the
gang
but
the
one
who
did
the
work
did
not
get
hung
he
got
away
We
four
were
hung
because
we
were
there
I
was
innocent
My
work
was
to
watch
which
I
did
but
I
did
not
murder
I
was
hung
for
it
If
you
have
any
influence
at
all
do
not
hang
people
Let
them
have
another
chance
because
sometimes
you
will
find
they
are
innocent
Keep
them
in
the
pen
give
them
another
chance
If
they
are
hung
then
where
are
they
All
they
have
in
their
hearts
is
hatred
They
go
back
to
earth
life
and
do
more
mischief
They
control
people
and
obsession
steps
in
I
had
hatred
when
I
was
hung
and
said
if
there
is
life
again
I
will
get
even
and
fight
for
revenge
You
remember
Tillie
who
lived
next
door
to
me
I
told
you
about
her
before
She
used
to
come
to
your
circles
I
followed
her
once
and
through
her
influence
I
came
into
your
circle
and
was
converted
to
the
higher
life
Tillie
always
had
a
good
influence
over
me
and
sometimes
she
wanted
to
talk
to
me
but
mother
Was
always
jealous
and
didn
t
want
her
to
talk
Mother
was
very
mean
to
Tillie
s
people
She
got
so
mad
at
the
time
I
was
hung
that
she
tormented
all
her
neighbors
She
tore
up
all
the
fences
and
closed
up
all
the
stable
windows
on
their
side
She
tried
to
shoot
every
body
she
could
If
my
father
bad
had
the
gun
loaded
mother
would
have
been
in
great
trouble
Tillie
was
my
guardian
angel
and
through
your
circle
I
got
over
my
hatred
Now
I
try
to
help
others
with
the
light
you
gave
me
My
mission
is
to
help
the
unfortunate
ones
like
this
fellow
who
came
before
me
I
try
to
influence
people
to
be
more
just
If
you
have
a
chance
to
hang
any
one
don
t
do
it
but
give
him
another
chance
You
have
no
right
to
kill
Nobody
should
kill
another
person
We
are
all
God
s
children
We
all
make
mistakes
and
the
strong
should
help
the
weak
When
one
person
murders
another
no
justice
is
shown
no
mercy
The
judge
and
the
jury
what
mercy
do
they
show
a
fellow
when
he
has
murdered
Why
should
they
kill
him
instead
of
giving
him
another
chance
Why
don
t
they
give
a
good
word
to
the
poor
ones
Why
don
t
they
go
to
the
prisoners
and
teach
them
of
the
higher
life
and
also
have
psychic
circles
and
try
to
help
them
As
soon
as
you
stop
capital
punishment
you
will
not
have
so
much
killing
When
persons
are
hanged
they
have
revenge
and
hatred
in
their
hearts
and
all
they
want
to
do
is
kill
kill
kill
So
they
influence
sensitive
mortals
and
make
them
commit
all
kinds
of
crime
I
want
to
say
again
if
you
have
any
influence
stop
capital
punishment
This
is
a
Christian
country
and
nobody
has
a
right
to
kill
another
As
they
killed
Christ
so
they
kill
boys
who
have
been
murderers
instead
of
teaching
them
while
they
are
young
Isn
t
is
right
that
they
should
be
taught
to
do
better
and
to
live
better
lives
The
time
will
come
when
the
world
will
have
to
understand
that
it
must
overcome
selfishness
There
will
be
lots
of
trouble
before
that
time
comes
There
will
be
much
destruction
but
after
that
things
will
be
better
I
am
now
doing
my
work
in
the
spirit
world
and
I
thank
you
for
bringing
me
to
a
realization
and
waking
me
up
I
have
little
meetings
here
and
there
I
give
little
thoughts
of
cheer
to
those
in
darkness
I
am
up
against
a
very
hard
condition
and
that
is
to
get
my
mother
to
understand
I
wish
you
would
all
send
good
kind
thoughts
to
her
because
she
only
had
hatred
and
selfishness
and
jealousy
in
her
heart
She
was
so
wrapped
up
in
herself
that
now
she
will
not
listen
to
any
one
Help
me
to
wake
her
up
and
realize
the
true
condition
of
life
Oh
how
I
thank
you
for
helping
me
At
heart
I
was
not
a
murderer
yet
I
was
hung
for
murder
I
was
not
with
the
gang
that
was
doing
the
work
all
I
did
was
to
watch
I
was
there
with
them
and
that
was
enough
for
the
jury
I
had
the
name
Now
I
am
trying
to
do
my
part
but
I
have
much
to
learn
I
was
very
ignorant
of
the
real
life
My
father
wanted
me
to
go
to
Sunday
School
Mother
told
me
I
didn
t
need
to
go
but
I
went
and
I
didn
t
find
anything
there
that
appealed
to
me
so
I
quit
going
I
know
now
that
God
is
everywhere
and
that
I
am
a
part
of
God
I
had
a
hard
time
getting
rid
of
selfishness
jealousy
and
ignorance
they
are
the
root
of
all
evil
When
they
are
gone
love
kindness
and
sympathy
take
their
place
Get
an
understanding
of
the
higher
life
and
you
will
be
happy
All
should
be
brothers
and
sisters
on
earth
as
we
are
in
the
higher
life
In
the
spirit
world
our
real
eyes
are
opened
You
cannot
progress
until
you
have
learned
the
lessons
of
life
You
know
a
school
boy
cannot
go
to
University
until
after
he
gets
through
his
school
books
He
must
go
to
Kindergarten
before
he
can
enter
the
University
and
he
has
to
get
there
step
by
step
So
it
is
in
the
spirit
world
It
is
the
world
of
happiness
We
cannot
appreciate
it
until
we
have
it
before
us
Everybody
should
know
these
things
before
they
step
over
the
Borderland
We
cannot
go
to
the
spirit
world
until
we
have
an
understanding
of
it
When
we
are
one
with
God
then
we
have
happiness
I
do
not
know
much
and
I
cannot
say
much
because
I
have
seen
so
little
of
it
I
have
much
work
to
do
before
I
go
on
The
spirit
world
is
like
going
into
a
garden
and
seeing
one
beautiful
flower
here
and
another
there
The
flowers
all
stand
up
so
straight
and
look
at
you
and
seem
to
say
Please
take
me
This
one
has
a
certain
odor
and
that
one
another
but
all
are
beautiful
and
fragrant
The
spirit
world
is
like
a
flower
bed
all
is
beauty
and
harmony
I
mean
there
is
no
selfishness
One
shines
more
than
another
because
he
has
more
understanding
We
will
all
get
there
but
we
have
to
gain
advancement
for
ourselves
No
one
needs
to
get
discouraged
all
will
get
there
but
it
takes
time
Thank
you
for
having
helped
me
to
an
understanding
and
a
home
But
for
that
I
should
have
been
an
earthbound
spirit
doing
more
harm
than
good
for
I
had
hatred
in
my
heart
I
am
very
happy
but
I
want
you
all
to
send
a
good
thought
to
my
mother
so
that
I
can
wake
her
up
and
help
her
to
overcome
her
selfishness
jealousy
and
ignorance
Just
give
me
a
chance
to
wake
her
up
I
thank
you
all
CHAPTER
VII
Spirits
and
Suicide
A
GREAT
NUMBER
of
unaccountable
suicides
are
due
to
the
obsessing
or
possessing
influence
of
earthbound
spirits
Some
of
these
spirits
are
actuated
by
a
desire
to
torment
their
victims
others
who
have
ended
their
physical
existence
as
suicides
find
themselves
still
alive
and
having
no
knowledge
of
a
spirit
world
labor
under
the
delusion
that
their
self
destructive
attempts
have
failed
and
continue
their
suicidal
efforts
When
these
intelligences
come
in
contact
with
mortal
sensitives
they
mistake
the
physical
bodies
for
their
own
and
impress
the
sensitives
with
morbid
thoughts
and
instigate
them
to
deeds
of
self
destruction
The
fate
of
a
suicide
is
invariably
one
of
deepest
misery
his
rash
act
holding
him
in
the
earth
sphere
until
such
time
as
his
physical
life
would
have
had
a
natural
ending
One
suicide
case
which
we
contacted
was
the
spirit
of
a
woman
Mrs
X
who
had
been
my
Sunday
School
teacher
when
I
was
a
boy
in
Europe
but
of
whom
Mrs
Wickland
had
never
heard
This
lady
had
been
intelligent
and
spiritual
an
earnest
church
member
happily
married
and
the
mother
of
several
children
Without
any
warning
while
apparently
happy
and
contented
she
had
suddenly
hung
herself
and
the
horrified
husband
and
children
could
in
no
way
account
for
the
tragedy
One
winter
day
ten
years
later
when
Mrs
Wickland
and
I
were
alone
in
our
home
in
Chicago
Mrs
Wickland
was
unexpectedly
controlled
by
a
spirit
who
gasped
for
breath
and
seemed
to
be
strangling
This
spirit
like
so
many
others
was
unconscious
of
controlling
a
body
not
its
own
and
upon
contacting
matter
again
experienced
its
last
death
struggle
After
much
questioning
I
learned
to
my
great
surprise
that
this
was
the
spirit
of
my
former
friend
who
had
ended
her
physical
life
by
hanging
herself
She
was
still
bound
to
the
earth
sphere
and
related
the
indescribable
mental
hell
she
had
been
in
during
all
those
years
As
soon
as
I
found
myself
out
of
my
body
I
saw
at
once
the
cause
for
my
rash
act
Evil
spirits
who
had
been
attracted
to
me
by
the
jealous
thoughts
of
other
persons
were
standing
near
grinning
with
devilish
satisfaction
at
their
work
They
had
influenced
me
to
end
my
life
I
had
no
occasion
to
even
think
of
such
folly
An
irresistible
impulse
had
suddenly
come
over
me
I
fastened
the
rope
around
my
neck
and
only
realized
what
I
had
done
when
it
was
too
late
I
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
been
able
to
regain
possession
of
my
body
Oh
what
horrors
of
despair
and
remorse
I
have
gone
through
My
home
shattered
my
husband
brokenhearted
and
discouraged
and
my
little
ones
needing
my
care
They
do
not
know
that
I
come
to
them
and
try
to
comfort
them
and
I
have
seen
nothing
but
gloom
and
darkness
until
now
Comforted
and
reassured
by
an
explanation
of
the
true
spiritual
realms
this
spirit
was
eager
to
go
with
the
higher
intelligences
and
learn
how
she
might
be
of
service
to
her
loved
ones
on
earth
Many
years
later
when
we
had
with
us
a
patient
of
strong
suicidal
tendencies
this
spirit
returned
to
warn
her
against
carrying
out
her
intentions
EXPERIENCE
NOVEMBER
Spirit
MRS
X
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
It
is
a
long
time
since
I
have
been
here
I
should
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
this
young
lady
who
is
contemplating
suicide
Many
years
ago
I
was
a
happy
wife
with
two
dear
children
and
a
very
kind
husband
We
lived
together
happily
since
we
were
both
of
a
cheerful
disposition
and
because
of
this
there
were
many
jealous
thoughts
centered
upon
us
I
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
I
was
a
psychic
because
I
belonged
to
the
Baptist
Church
I
did
the
very
best
I
could
around
the
home
but
somebody
started
to
upset
us
One
day
when
my
husband
went
to
work
I
kissed
him
goodby
and
was
very
happy
but
after
he
was
gone
all
in
a
moment
something
got
hold
of
me
I
did
not
know
what
I
was
doing
I
didn
t
know
a
thing
I
remember
feeling
very
strange
as
if
somebody
had
taken
complete
hold
of
me
and
I
did
not
realize
what
was
taking
place
After
awhile
everything
changed
I
saw
my
husband
in
terrible
mental
agony
and
he
was
crying
very
bitterly
When
things
became
a
little
clearer
to
me
I
saw
my
body
hanging
there
Oh
if
you
could
only
realize
what
a
condition
I
was
in
My
husband
stood
there
in
the
shed
looking
at
my
hanging
body
he
was
crying
heart
brokenly
but
I
could
do
nothing
to
help
him
There
I
stood
at
his
side
wishing
with
all
my
power
that
I
could
have
that
body
again
but
I
could
not
There
were
my
two
little
children
weeping
for
me
and
I
could
not
help
them
I
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
until
I
saw
some
evil
spirits
standing
near
laughing
at
us
They
had
gotten
hold
of
me
and
made
me
kill
myself
because
they
wanted
to
break
up
our
happy
home
My
husband
could
never
forget
the
sight
of
my
body
hanging
in
the
shed
My
children
were
small
and
needed
my
help
but
the
responsibility
of
raising
them
was
thrown
on
my
husband
It
should
have
been
my
duty
to
have
shared
that
responsibility
Although
I
had
been
influenced
to
do
what
I
did
for
ten
long
years
I
could
see
nothing
before
me
but
what
I
had
done
I
could
see
how
much
the
children
needed
me
but
I
could
do
nothing
for
them
and
oh
how
I
suffered
My
poor
poor
children
One
day
a
very
cold
day
I
felt
that
I
had
come
to
life
again
I
felt
a
new
warmth
I
did
not
know
where
I
was
but
I
felt
that
I
had
come
to
life
I
found
myself
talking
to
Dr
Wickland
He
told
me
what
had
happened
and
explained
that
I
was
only
temporarily
controlling
Mrs
Wickland
and
that
friends
would
take
me
to
the
spirit
world
After
this
I
felt
somewhat
better
and
I
thank
you
for
having
helped
me
to
the
beautiful
condition
I
have
now
But
oh
how
I
suffered
during
those
ten
long
years
All
I
could
see
was
my
body
hanging
before
me
and
the
children
s
need
of
me
My
husband
and
children
How
they
needed
my
care
but
I
was
powerless
to
help
them
I
want
to
warn
anybody
who
is
thinking
of
trying
to
get
out
of
the
physical
body
Do
not
do
it
under
any
circumstances
You
do
not
know
you
cannot
realize
what
a
hell
you
will
find
yourself
in
You
cannot
step
into
your
body
again
after
you
once
leave
it
and
you
cannot
do
your
duty
to
others
Think
of
my
children
always
having
the
thought
that
their
mother
committed
suicide
Neither
my
husband
nor
children
can
ever
really
forgive
me
Even
though
I
was
controlled
when
I
did
what
I
did
I
have
had
to
suffer
If
you
had
an
understanding
of
the
laws
of
the
spirit
side
of
life
you
would
not
commit
suicide
knowing
the
results
Overcome
any
thoughts
of
taking
your
life
Be
happy
on
this
earth
plane
until
the
time
comes
for
you
to
go
to
the
spirit
world
The
ten
years
that
I
suffered
was
the
time
I
should
have
remained
on
earth
before
passing
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
After
my
ten
years
had
expired
I
should
have
left
my
body
for
my
life
would
have
been
lived
out
but
during
that
time
I
could
have
given
help
to
my
husband
and
children
I
should
not
have
reached
the
spirit
side
of
life
before
my
allotted
time
and
my
punishment
was
to
constantly
see
my
body
hanging
before
me
for
ten
years
All
that
time
I
could
realize
that
my
husband
and
children
were
in
great
need
of
my
help
Now
I
am
as
happy
as
I
can
be
until
my
family
is
reunited
and
I
am
doing
all
I
can
to
help
my
children
I
want
you
to
send
my
love
to
my
dear
husband
He
feels
that
he
is
all
alone
I
am
with
him
but
I
can
do
nothing
to
comfort
him
in
his
loneliness
Goodbye
On
November
while
Mrs
Wickland
and
I
were
visiting
with
friends
in
Chicago
a
circle
had
been
formed
for
a
psychic
demonstration
when
Mrs
Wickland
heard
some
one
say
I
am
in
the
dark
She
inquired
who
had
made
the
remark
but
no
one
in
the
room
had
uttered
a
word
however
the
gentleman
sitting
beside
Mrs
Wickland
declared
that
he
too
had
heard
the
voice
A
moment
later
Mrs
Wickland
became
entranced
and
fell
to
the
floor
the
spirit
clutching
at
the
throat
and
crying
Take
the
rope
away
Take
the
rope
away
I
am
in
the
dark
Why
did
I
do
it
Oh
why
did
I
do
it
When
the
excited
spirit
had
been
somewhat
quieted
she
told
us
that
her
name
was
Minnie
Harmening
that
she
was
a
young
girl
and
had
lived
on
a
farm
near
Palatine
As
she
was
speaking
brokenly
between
sobs
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
her
words
and
I
understood
her
to
say
that
she
came
from
Palestine
which
seemed
rather
strange
The
spirit
was
in
great
grief
because
she
had
hung
herself
and
thought
the
body
of
the
psychic
was
her
own
and
that
the
rope
was
still
about
her
neck
She
said
that
on
October
without
any
cause
or
premeditation
she
had
been
overpowered
by
a
desire
to
take
her
life
and
when
alone
had
gone
to
the
barn
and
hung
herself
A
big
man
with
a
black
beard
made
me
do
it
Spirit
He
met
me
in
the
barnyard
and
hypnotized
me
and
made
me
hang
myself
to
a
rafter
but
I
don
t
know
why
I
did
it
My
brother
John
found
me
and
cut
me
down
and
my
parents
were
almost
beside
themselves
But
I
am
not
dead
I
am
at
home
all
the
time
and
I
talk
to
my
mother
and
father
I
try
to
comfort
them
and
make
them
know
that
I
am
not
dead
but
they
do
not
notice
me
and
do
not
answer
me
My
folks
all
sit
around
the
table
crying
and
there
is
my
empty
chair
but
no
one
answers
me
Why
don
t
they
answer
me
We
could
not
at
first
convince
her
that
she
was
expressing
herself
through
the
body
of
another
but
after
a
lengthy
conversation
she
was
somewhat
enlightened
and
comforted
and
left
with
spirit
friends
Previous
to
this
incident
neither
Mrs
Wickland
nor
I
had
heard
of
the
Harmening
suicide
mystery
and
we
did
not
know
that
such
a
girl
had
ever
existed
Several
days
later
a
reporter
from
one
of
the
Chicago
dailies
came
to
interview
us
regarding
our
research
work
and
I
related
our
recent
experience
with
the
Harmening
girl
In
great
surprise
he
said
that
he
himself
had
been
the
reporter
on
the
Harmening
case
and
that
the
girl
had
lived
in
Palatine
Cook
County
Illinois
The
dead
body
of
the
girl
had
been
found
hanging
in
her
father
s
barn
but
no
one
knew
of
any
cause
for
suicide
although
the
girl
had
always
been
peculiar
There
was
a
suspicion
of
murder
because
the
clothes
about
the
chest
had
been
torn
and
the
neck
badly
scratched
leading
the
authorities
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
the
body
hung
up
to
avert
suspicion
On
Thanksgiving
Day
November
the
spirit
of
Minnie
Harmening
came
to
us
again
still
grieving
because
of
the
suffering
of
her
parents
and
the
intolerant
attitude
assumed
toward
her
family
by
the
villagers
and
church
members
who
considered
the
family
disgraced
The
girl
had
been
a
devout
member
of
a
German
Lutheran
Church
but
because
she
had
died
a
suicide
the
pastor
had
refused
to
allow
the
funeral
service
to
be
held
in
the
church
nor
would
the
congregation
permit
the
body
to
be
buried
in
the
consecrated
ground
of
the
churchyard
Minnie
said
that
the
funeral
service
had
been
held
at
the
home
of
her
parents
but
the
minister
had
considered
the
viewing
of
the
body
such
a
sacrilege
that
he
had
stepped
outside
the
house
while
others
paid
their
last
tribute
and
this
had
added
still
more
to
the
grief
of
her
already
distracted
parents
These
statements
I
found
corroborated
in
the
papers
afterward
I
asked
the
spirit
why
her
clothes
had
been
torn
and
she
answered
I
did
that
myself
The
big
man
spirit
with
the
beard
told
me
to
hang
myself
but
as
soon
as
I
had
kicked
the
box
away
from
my
feet
I
felt
the
rope
tightening
around
my
neck
and
came
to
my
senses
I
clawed
at
the
rope
and
tried
to
loosen
it
but
I
only
tightened
it
and
scratched
myself
Fourteen
years
later
the
spirit
of
Minnie
Harmening
spoke
to
us
again
EXPERIENCE
OCTOBER
Spirit
MINNIE
HARMENING
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
want
to
thank
you
for
all
the
help
you
have
given
me
When
I
committed
the
act
which
took
my
life
I
was
only
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
I
had
so
much
suffering
afterwards
and
was
very
very
miserable
I
could
see
my
father
and
mother
sitting
at
the
table
crying
and
I
could
not
help
them
When
the
time
came
for
my
body
to
be
buried
the
minister
would
not
take
it
into
the
church
and
would
not
bury
it
because
he
said
I
had
committed
a
sin
in
taking
my
own
life
He
also
said
that
I
could
not
be
buried
in
the
graveyard
because
of
my
act
and
he
would
not
even
look
at
the
funeral
as
it
passed
by
I
did
not
do
the
deed
myself
I
was
obsessed
It
was
very
hard
for
my
father
and
mother
and
sisters
The
minister
would
not
even
come
into
the
room
where
my
body
lay
but
spoke
from
another
room
he
was
too
holy
to
be
where
the
body
was
This
made
it
much
harder
for
my
parents
Do
not
think
that
by
taking
your
own
life
you
can
bury
yourself
in
the
hereafter
I
was
obsessed
when
I
took
my
life
and
did
not
know
what
I
was
doing
but
I
am
suffering
because
my
father
and
mother
are
still
mourning
for
me
Very
often
I
go
to
see
my
poor
old
mother
and
she
is
very
old
now
I
am
the
girl
who
lived
at
Palatine
You
remember
me
don
t
you
The
neighbors
made
it
still
harder
for
my
folks
because
they
told
mother
what
a
disgrace
it
was
for
the
family
I
feel
very
badly
about
the
matter
I
want
to
thank
you
for
the
help
I
received
here
It
was
through
you
that
I
received
light
and
understanding
I
am
happy
in
a
way
but
not
real
happy
because
I
feel
the
grief
my
father
and
mother
have
When
I
lived
I
did
not
understand
obsession
After
I
had
hung
myself
I
saw
a
man
beside
me
staring
at
me
Just
when
the
rope
was
around
my
neck
I
came
to
I
tried
my
best
to
get
it
off
my
neck
but
I
had
kicked
the
box
from
under
myself
and
my
whole
weight
was
in
the
rope
and
I
could
do
nothing
I
scratched
my
body
in
an
effort
to
free
myself
but
it
was
no
use
If
one
takes
his
own
life
he
goes
through
a
bitter
experience
and
suffers
greatly
yes
suffers
greatly
I
thank
you
very
much
for
the
light
and
understanding
I
have
received
for
it
has
been
a
great
help
to
me
Another
experience
illustrating
the
power
exercised
over
sensitive
mortals
by
malignant
earthbound
spirits
occurred
in
Chicago
Mrs
Wickland
and
I
were
resting
on
a
bench
in
Lincoln
Park
on
July
when
an
elderly
gentleman
seated
himself
beside
us
Mrs
Wickland
at
first
saw
two
men
on
the
bench
but
upon
looking
again
noticed
only
one
A
conversation
ensued
which
drifted
into
occultism
and
when
the
stranger
Mr
F
expressed
an
interest
in
psychic
phenomena
we
invited
him
to
call
at
our
home
On
the
following
evening
Mr
F
called
upon
us
and
later
Mrs
Wickland
became
entranced
by
the
spirit
of
a
man
who
was
greatly
agitated
He
called
Mr
F
by
name
saying
he
was
his
friend
Mr
B
of
Cleveland
who
had
been
with
him
in
Lincoln
Park
the
previous
week
and
had
had
an
appointment
to
meet
him
there
again
on
that
very
day
Mr
F
was
greatly
startled
by
this
communication
for
his
friend
had
committed
suicide
in
his
club
at
Cleveland
the
preceding
Sunday
Mr
B
had
lived
in
Cleveland
and
had
come
to
Chicago
the
week
before
to
close
a
real
estate
deal
but
before
final
negotiations
were
completed
had
returned
for
a
week
end
visit
to
Cleveland
He
was
in
a
cheerful
frame
of
mind
when
he
left
his
home
on
Sunday
morning
but
after
conversing
with
a
group
of
friends
at
his
club
he
had
gone
into
an
adjoining
room
placed
carbolic
acid
in
his
glass
of
wine
and
drinking
it
had
fallen
dead
Mr
B
had
been
a
man
of
wealth
and
position
to
all
appearances
singularly
fortunate
and
happy
and
there
seemed
no
reason
for
his
suicide
The
spirit
of
Mr
B
was
greatly
troubled
and
bewildered
and
asked
his
friend
what
was
the
matter
with
him
I
go
home
to
my
wife
and
children
but
they
do
not
seem
to
see
me
or
hear
me
I
have
been
with
you
for
several
days
but
you
will
not
talk
to
me
What
is
the
matter
Calming
the
spirit
we
finally
made
him
realize
that
to
the
world
he
was
dead
and
after
explaining
the
suicide
to
him
we
asked
why
he
had
taken
his
life
I
did
not
take
my
life
I
went
to
the
club
and
was
talking
to
my
friends
then
I
went
into
another
room
but
I
do
not
know
what
happened
after
that
The
next
thing
that
I
remember
is
that
I
saw
my
body
lying
on
the
floor
and
a
man
spirit
watching
me
and
laughing
After
learning
more
of
his
condition
the
spirit
urged
his
friend
to
write
to
his
wife
and
tell
her
that
in
reality
he
was
not
dead
at
all
On
the
evening
of
the
Mr
F
called
again
when
the
spirit
of
Mr
B
came
a
second
time
still
greatly
disturbed
and
asked
his
friend
why
he
had
not
written
to
his
wife
and
urgently
begged
him
to
do
so
I
know
now
that
I
was
influenced
to
commit
suicide
by
evil
spirits
who
were
opposed
to
my
carrying
out
that
real
estate
deal
Rather
than
see
my
purpose
accomplished
they
determined
to
kill
me
Please
tell
my
wife
the
truth
and
warn
all
the
world
to
be
wiser
While
the
trial
of
a
young
man
who
was
accused
of
killing
a
college
girl
Marion
Lambert
was
in
progress
in
Waukegan
Illinois
the
spirit
of
the
murdered
girl
was
brought
to
us
on
June
entrancing
Mrs
Wickland
She
was
weeping
uncontrollably
and
in
such
distress
that
she
was
at
first
unable
to
speak
then
suddenly
cried
out
I
did
it
I
did
it
Nobody
can
help
me
now
If
I
only
could
tell
them
and
make
them
understand
but
they
will
not
listen
I
am
in
the
dark
and
can
see
only
the
past
and
everything
foolish
I
have
done
Oh
what
a
foolish
girl
I
was
What
is
your
name
Marion
Lambert
Where
do
you
think
you
are
I
do
not
know
I
am
not
acquainted
with
any
one
here
Crying
They
talk
of
hell
but
that
could
not
be
as
bad
as
what
I
have
gone
through
just
because
of
my
foolishness
I
would
like
very
much
to
get
out
of
all
this
trouble
I
took
my
own
life
I
didn
t
mean
to
kill
myself
I
only
meant
to
take
enough
cyanide
of
potassium
to
scare
him
And
now
they
blame
him
for
my
death
I
would
so
like
to
do
something
to
make
them
understand
he
is
not
guilty
Oh
but
they
will
not
believe
me
I
talk
to
the
different
people
at
the
court
house
but
they
take
no
notice
of
me
and
will
not
listen
to
me
Everything
is
so
strange
I
don
t
know
what
to
do
I
was
such
a
foolish
girl
Oh
my
poor
father
and
mother
I
m
half
crazy
with
trouble
and
worry
If
I
could
only
go
to
the
court
house
and
show
them
that
I
am
not
dead
but
that
I
am
alive
Why
don
t
they
listen
to
me
I
go
to
the
court
house
but
nobody
will
speak
to
me
and
I
have
spoken
to
so
many
people
I
am
in
such
agony
I
don
t
know
what
to
do
If
I
had
had
more
sense
I
would
never
have
done
what
I
did
but
it
s
no
use
saying
that
now
it
is
too
late
I
wish
I
could
be
in
my
body
again
I
studied
a
great
deal
but
I
was
so
foolish
it
did
me
no
good
and
now
I
am
suffering
Everything
is
so
dark
and
I
am
in
such
trouble
The
spirit
was
so
hysterical
that
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
make
her
understand
that
she
could
best
help
by
keeping
away
from
the
court
house
go
with
kindly
intelligences
to
the
spirit
world
and
learn
the
higher
purposes
of
life
In
July
the
interest
of
the
American
public
was
centered
in
a
murder
case
in
Los
Angeles
in
which
Harry
New
was
accused
of
killing
his
sweetheart
Freda
Lesser
The
tragedy
had
taken
place
on
July
in
Topanga
Canyon
where
Harry
and
Freda
had
driven
late
in
the
day
Near
the
crest
a
shot
was
fired
which
ended
the
girl
s
life
and
Harry
New
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
murder
The
girl
had
been
expecting
motherhood
and
this
fact
was
used
in
the
trial
as
a
motive
for
the
crime
Harry
New
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
and
sentenced
to
San
Quentin
for
ten
years
During
the
trial
we
had
an
interesting
experience
which
would
have
thrown
new
light
on
the
case
could
it
have
been
accepted
as
evidence
in
court

I

was
going

He
tried

went

Foolish

I
thought
I
had
only
hurt
myself
Oh
how
I
suffered
I
do
not
see

die
you
never
suffer
any
more

I
have
suffered

No

dies

Why

I
go
where

is
and
try
to
tell
them
that
the
whole
thing
was
caused
by
my
foolishness
Oh
if
I
could
only
change
things
I
took
that
revolver
and
said
I
was
going
to
kill
myself
but
I
thought
I
would
only
scare
him
When
he
saw
I
had
the
revolver
I
he
fought
with
me
to
get
it
away
I
didn
t
mean
anything
I
was
only
fooling
I
love
him
and
he
loves
me
He
did
not
know
how
the
revolver
came
in
his
hands
He
had
it
in
his
auto
I
picked
it
up
and
hid
it
in
my
clothes
for
a
while
and
then
I
told
him
I
was
going
to
kill
myself
Dr
Had
you
any
idea
of
marrying
him
Sp
Yes
some
idea
Dr
Did
you
really
care
for
him
enough
to
marry
him
Sp
Yes
We
had
no
quarrel
I
was
just
going
to
scare
him
but
you
know
girls
do
foolish
things
sometimes
I
wanted
to
test
him
to
see
if
he
cared
for
me
Crying
Dr
Remember
you
are
using
my
wife

brain
and
body
and
must
try
to
calm
yourself
Look
around

I
can
never
be
helped
any
more
I
m
so
unhappy
Dr
When
you
leave
here
you
will
be
taken
to
the
spirit
world
You
have
not
yet
found
it
because
you
have
been
so
disturbed
with
your
trouble

friends
are
around
you
waiting
to
help
you

I
want
to
tell
those
men
bow
things
happened
but
they
will
not
listen
to
me
They
don
t
seem

hear
me

I
go

because
he
feels
me
around
him
sometimes
they
think

he
is
crazy

You
are
a
free
spirit
now

listen

the
spirit
friends
who
are
here

will
teach
you
how
to
obtain
understanding

overcome
your
troubles

Will

for
my
foolishness

I
hardly
think
so
Sp
Poor
fellow
poor
fellow
I
feel
so
sorry
for
him
and
his
mother
They
both
cry
and
my
mother
cries
Why
did
I
do
such
a
foolish
thing
It
was
a
piece
of
folly
Dr
Now
look
around
and
see
if
you
can
see
friends
who
will
help
you
Sp
There
s
a
young
lady
standing
there
spirit
and
she
says
that
she
was
helped
here
and
she
says
she
brought
me
here

says
she
was
in
the
same
trouble
I
was
and
that
she
was
helped
and
is
so
happy
now
and
that
she
can
help
me
She
says
she
was
just
as
foolish
as
I
was
she
took
poison
to
scare
her
fellow
and
killed
herself
Dr
Does
she
tell
you
her
name
Sp
She
says
she
has
been
around
me
because
she
does
missionary
work
helping
to
take
care
of
girls
in
the
same
trouble
as
myself
Dr
Does
she
look
sorrowful
Sp
No
she
looks
happy
She
says
she
goes
around
and
finds
unfortunate
girls
who
are
in
the
same
condition
she
was
in
when
she
went
to
spirit
life
Crying
Dr
Don
t
allow
yourself
to
become
excited
You
do
not
realize
what
a
privilege
you
have
in
being
allowed
to
control
a
mortal
body
and
obtain
understanding
Many
remain
in

bewildered
condition

years

years

you
helped
her
when
she
was
in
the
same
trouble
I
am
Dr
What
washer
name
Sp
She
says
her
name
is
Marion
Lambert
She
says
she
works
hard
to
help
unfortunate
girls
who
are
in
trouble
and
do
foolish
things
and
that
she
tries
to
help
them
to
happiness
She
says
that
is
her
mission
and
that
is
why
she
brought
me
here
Crying
Dr
Try
to
understand
that
you
are
using
the
body
of
this
psychic
only
temporarily
and
must
not
misuse
it
by
becoming
excited
This
girl
you
see
came
to
us
some
years
ago
in
the
same
distressed
condition
that
you
are
in
Now
she
tells
you
that
she
is
happy
and
doing
missionary
work
Sp
Can
I
ever
be
happy
Dr
Of
course
you
can
This
is
only
a
temporary
trouble
you
are
in
No
one
ever
dies
it
is
only
the
physical
body
which
is
lost
The
spirit
cannot
die
Sp
But
I
never
understood
that
I
never
heard
anything
about
spirits
before
Dr
If
any
one
had
spoken
to
you
about
spirits
while
you
were
in
earth
life
you
would
probably
have
laughed
at
the
idea
Sp
The
lady
says
she
will
take
care
of
me
she
wants
me
to
rest
I
am
so
tired
She
says
that
I
must
go
with
her
and
also
that
I
must
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
of
coming
here
Will
I
have
any
more
of
that
awful
crying
Dr
No
You
will
be
taught
the
real
lesson
of
life
Physical
life
is
only
temporary
Every
one
has
troubles
of
one
kind
or
another
but
through
trouble
we
become
wiser
Sp
Gazing
intently
at
some

brightened

she
shook
her
head
No
no

Crying
Dr
What
do
you
see
Sp
I
was
expecting
a
baby
and
a
girl
has
come
holding
a
baby
which
she
says
belongs
to
me
Can
I
have
it
Dr
Certainly
you
can
Sp
But
I
am
not
worthy
They
will
look
down
on
me
Dr
You
are
not
going
to
remain
on
earth
Sp
I
feel
much
happier
than
I
did
when
I
came
When
did
the
baby
come
Dr
The
baby
was
freed
when
you
lost
your
body
Sp
I
don
t
see
how
that
could
happen
Dr
Many
things
happen
with
which
you
are
not
familiar
You
do
not
understand
the
wonderful
mystery
of
life
Sp
Did
I
kill
the
baby
too
when
the
revolver
went
off
Dr
When
your
body
was
killed
the
spirit
of
the
little
on
was
also
liberated
While
you
are
talking
through
this
body
we
cannot
see
you
The
real
things
of
life
are
invisible
Did
you
ever
see
music
Sp
I
have
heard
it
I
hear
beautiful
music
now
Dr
You
are
beginning
to
realize
the

Another

The

This

Dr
When

greatly
interested

The
other

says
she

that

She
says

She

wrote
Oh

He

Dr
Listen

By

You

some
regard

The

any
more
Sp
I
got
so
that
I
could
not

so
badly

Yes

Goodbye
Shortly
after
the
death
of
Virginia
R
cinema
star
who
died
in
San
Francisco
the
spirit
of
the
girl
was
brought
by
Olive

to
our
circle
to
be
awakened
and
afterward
Olive
T
herself
spoke

EXPERIENCE
APRIL
Spirit
OLIVE
T
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
felt
that
I
must
come
in
and
thank
you
for
the
glory
that
has
been
bestowed
upon
me
since
the
time
I
was
here
last
During
our
childhood
we
should
be
taught
the
real
lesson
of
life
and
made
to
understand
life
in
its
true
sense
Let
pictures
be
shown
of
the
real
life
If
they
would
put
on
the
screen
the
pictures
of
the
real
life
the
real
understanding
and
teach
the
people
that
there
is
no
death
teach
them
of
the
beautiful
conditions
on
the
other
side
of
life
which
are
waiting
for
every
one
entitled
to
them
after
they
understand
the
higher
life
the
world
would
be
different
I
lived
in
a
life
of
make
believe
and
we
tried
to
amuse
humanity
I
am
sorry
for
the
girls
who
fall
into
a
life
of
sport
They
think
they
have
a
good
time
yes
for
a
while
But
there
is
always
some
little
voice
conscience
that
bothers
you
no
matter
how
you
try
to
kill
it
Oh
if
I
could
only
teach
the
young
girls
tell
them
of
the
folly
of
such
a
life
If
I
could
only
teach
them
to
look
up
to
the
higher
life
and
show
them
the
truth
of
that
life
We
should
teach
people
to
live
for
others
not
for
self
We
should
teach
the
girls
the
principles
of
life
One
thing
that
is
very
detrimental
to
the
world
is
drink
and
morphine
As
conditions
are
now
they
are
driving
the
girls
and
boys
to
misery
People
condemn
without
acting
and
what
do
they
gain
They
drive
the
young
to
the
depths
because
when
the
law
forbids
things
they
want
them
and
in
some
way
or
another
they
get
them
They
enjoy
them
more
because
they
are
forbidden
There
is
also
something
else
You
know
whiskey
and
the
other
alcoholic
drinks
have
a
thousand
yes
a
million
thoughts
that
go
with
them
The
cranks
concentrate
their
minds
on
drink
and
condemn
it
and
when
sensitives
get
it
they
become
wild
They
become
crazy
with
all
the
thoughts
that
are
sent
with
it
It
drives
them
down
and
down
Man
should
live
and
learn
of
God
s
wonderful
manifestations
God
is
the
Life
of
All
but
man
is
the
devil
I
do
not
mean
man
alone
when
I
say
man
but
I
mean
humanity
God
gave
us
a
free
will
but
we
misuse
it
People
should
be
taught
the
true
teachings
of
Christ
They
say
Did
not
Christ
make
wine
And
did
He
not
give
it
to
the
people
They
do
not
understand
that
it
was
the
Wine
of
Life
Christ
spoke
about
the
spiritual
The
majority
of
people
think
he
spoke
of
the
material
Understand
God
right
Do
not
let
us
fear
Him
He
is
not
a
man
sitting
on
a
throne
but
He
is
the
Spirit
of
All
Life
Everything
around
us
is
a
part
of
this
Divine
Life
Evil
has
its
place
just
as
the
good
has
If
we
had
no
evil
we
could
not
know
the
good
It
is
only
from
the
experiences
we
pass
through
that
we
learn
the
lessons
of
life
that
we
gain
wisdom
and
I
learn
of
the
life
everlasting
that
lies
before
us
My
salvation
came
in
the
spirit
world
when
I
found
the
truth
because
I
had
been
through
misery
After
I
had
gone
through
the
fire
of
conscience
I
was
purified
I
was
anxious
to
find
the
truth
and
after
I
found
it
there
was
no
doubting
I
wanted
peace
and
harmony
and
I
was
then
ready
for
it
You
find
gold
after
it
has
gone
through
the
fire
of
purification
After
my
soul
had
gone
through
the
fire
of
conscience
I
found
God
within
myself
not
on
the
outside
Find
God
and
be
content
within
yourself
Learn
to
understand
yourself
first
before
you
judge
others
then
you
will
not
judge
Let
us
be
friends
to
all
do
good
to
all
and
do
good
whenever
we
can
Let
us
conquer
self
Whenever
self
rises
within
you
to
torment
you
and
tries
to
make
you
give
way
to
anger
and
give
way
to
drinking
and
all
kinds
of
trouble
say
to
yourself
that
you
are
not
angry
and
that
you
will
not
give
way
to
things
Then
instead
of
saying
anything
to
others
get
up
and
turn
around
and
your
anger
will
be
gone
because
you
will
not
say
what
you
wanted
to
and
many
times
in
that
way
you
will
have
harmony
When
we
are
in
a
state
of
anger
we
say
things
that
afterwards
we
are
sorry
for
and
sometimes
these
things
can
never
be
forgotten
So
let
us
always
think
if
we
feel
anger
coming
over
us
that
we
will
not
give
way
to
it
let
us
turn
around
and
say
No
I
will
conquer
self
I
will
look
to
higher
things
not
the
lower
I
will
conquer
and
you
cannot
come
in
and
torment
I
was
in
that
state
of
anger
and
it
was
my
death
What
did
I
do
I
killed
myself
I
did
not
mean
to
kill
myself
but
I
did
it
in
a
mood
of
anger
Conquer
self
before
it
is
too
late
Conquer
your
anger
before
it
goes
too
far
I
was
swept
by
anger
and
what
happened
I
killed
myself
Then
when
I
woke
up
and
saw
what
I
had
done
I
was
in
anguish
It
was
through
anger
anger
and
selfishness
Let
us
conquer
and
when
anger
comes
in
let
us
say
Get
thee
behind
me
Satan
Turnaround
and
that
will
shutout
any
spirit
that
would
take
possession
of
you
If
I
had
turned
around
I
would
not
have
done
what
I
did
If
I
could
only
tell
people
of
the
life
they
should
live
and
have
them
put
pictures
on
the
screen
of
the
true
life
and
teachings
of
Jesus
and
the
lessons
He
taught
and
how
much
good
we
could
all
do
for
humanity
it
would
turn
many
criminals
and
they
would
become
good
men
and
omen
This

Good
Night
Mrs
R
was
a
patient
with
such
strong
suicidal
inclinations
that
she
was
unable
to
eat
or
sleep
constantly
scratched
the
hair
from
her
head
and
had
wasted
away
to
a
mere
shadow
She
declared
that
she
had
killed
five
hundred
persons
and
her
one
thought
was
to
end
her
own
life
and
since
there
seemed
no
hope
of
recovery
she
was
placed
in
a
sanitarium
where
she
was
confined
in
a
locked
room
for
three
years
After
being
placed
in
our
care
she
made
several
attempts
at
self
destruction
but
within
a
few
weeks
she
was
freed
from
a
gloomy
spirit
who
had
himself
committed
suicide
and
from
that
time
there
was
no
further
recurrence
of
the
suicidal
impulse
Mrs
R
remained
with
us
for
some
time
gaining
steadily
in
weight
strength
and
health
she
became
entirely
normal
and
returned
to
live
with
her
relatives
taking
up
all
her
former
occupations

Where
did
you

I
was
straggling

No

head
It
hurts
me
so
badly
Dr
What
seems
to
be
the
matter
with
your

It
is
difficult

Who

They

What
kind

What

My

strange

Dr
How
long
have
you
been
dead
Sp
Dead
you
say
Why
I
m
not
dead
I
wish
I
were
Dr
Is
life
so
unpleasant
for
you
Sp
Yes
it
is
If
I
am
dead
then
it
is
very
hard
to
be
dead
I
have
tried
and
tried
to
die
but
it
seems
every
single
time
I
come
to
life
again
Why
is
it
that
I
cannot
die
Dr
There
is
no
actual
death
Sp
Of
course
there
is
Dr
How
do
you
know
there
is
such
a
thing
as
death
Sp
I
don
t
know
anything
In
great
distress
I
want
to
die
I
want
to
die
Life
is
so
dark
and
gloomy
I
wish
I
could
die
and
forget
forget
just
forget
Why
can
t
I
die
I
think
sometimes
I
am
dead
then
all
at
once
I
am
alive
again
I
want
to
forget
all
the
trouble
and
agony
that
I
have
Where
shall
I
go
so
that
I
can
die
Sometimes
I
get
in
places
auras
but
I
am
always
pushed
out
in
the
dark
again
and
I
go
from
place
to
place
I
cannot
find
my
home
and
I
cannot
die
What
is
the
matter
Oh
let
me
forget
just
for
a
little
while
Let
me
be
free
from
my
thoughts
and
this
horrible
darkness
Why
can
t
I
die
Dr
You
are
on
the
wrong
path
friend
Sp
Then
where
shall
I
find
the
right
path
Dr
Within
yourself
Sp
There
was
a
time
when
I
believed
in
a
God
and
there
was
a
time
when
I
believed
in
Heaven
and
hell
but
not
any
more
It
is
dark
and
gloomy
and
my
conscience
accuses
me
so
Let
me
forget
I
want
to
forget
oh
how
I
want
to
forget
Dr
Do
you
know

you
have
lost
your

Why

I

you
people
I
don
t
know
any
of
you
but
as
I
look
in
your
faces
you
appear
to
be
good
Will
you
take
me
in
and
give
me
a
little
light
and
some
happiness
I
have
not
seen
either
for
years
and
years
Dr
What
is
causing
all
your
trouble
Sp
Why
is
it
there
is
no
God
Why
does
He
let
me
be
in
this
darkness
and
gloom
I
was
once
a
good

must
not

No
no

Greatly
agitated
Dr
Tell
us
what
is
on

I
have
done
a

God

Try

You

Sp
I

a

Dr
You
are
using
a

I
cannot
think
how
I
could
have
become

my
sorrows

Seeing

If

The
patient
Mrs
R
had
a
number
of
times
attempted
to
run
away
They
are
coming
after
me
and
if
I
stay

will
catch

Let

my
accusers
Dr
Where

Dr
That

seventeen
years
ago
Can

you
realize

You

lost
your
physical

There
is
no
actual
death
only
transition
Only
the
physical
body
is
lost
Did
you
ever
study
the
problems
of
life
and
death
Sp
No
I
never
studied
anything
I
only
believed
My
name
is
Ralph
but
I
forget
my
last
name
My
father
is
dead
Dr
No
more
than
you
are
Sp
Of
course
I
am
not
dead
I
wish
I
were
Will
you
please
take
me
away
from
here
and
kill
me
so
that
I
can
die
Mrs
R
had
often
begged
to
be
killed
Oh
here
they
are
coming
again
I
will
not
confess
If
I
do
they
will
put
me
in
prison
and
I
am
in
trouble
enough
Dr
You
are
in
darkness
owing
to
your
ignorance
Confess
and
we
will
help
you
Sp
I
cannot
confess
I
have
tried
before
but
I
could
not
My
past
stands
out
right
before
me
Dr
From
what
you
say
you
have
evidently
been
obsessing
people
and
in
your
effort
to
kill
yourself
you
have
probably
caused
others
to
commit
suicide
Haven
t
you
found
yourself
in
queer
circumstances
at
times
Sp
I
did
not
try
to
understand
myself
In
alarm
Oh
Alice
Spirit
No
no
I
am
afraid
I
did
not
mean
to
do
what
I
did
No
Alice
don
t
accuse
me
Dr
If
you
will
tell
us
what
your
trouble
is
we
can
help
you
Sp
We
told
each
other
that
we
would
die
but
we
did
not
die
Alice
why
did
you
tell
me
to
kill
you
Why
did
you
I
killed
you
first
and
then
I
killed
myself
but
I
could
not
die
Oh
Alice
Alice
Dr
She
probably
understands
conditions
better
than
you
do
Sp
She
says
Ralph
we
were
foolish
I
will
tell
you
but
I
know
I
shall
be
arrested
when
I
get
through
Alice
and
I
were
engaged
to
be
married
but
her
parents
did
not
want
us
to
marry
because
they
thought
I
was
not
what
I
should
be
We
loved
each
other
very
dearly
so
we
decided
that
I
should
kill
her
then
kill
myself
I
did
it
but
I
never
could
kill
myself
and
I
guess
as
Alice
is
here
I
did
not
kill
her
either
Ever
since
I
tried
to
kill
her
she
comes
and
accuses
me
Alice
and
I
were
together
and
she
said
all
the
time
Now
kill
me
Quick
quick
Kill
me
Go
ahead
Do
it
Do
it
I
hesitated
because
I
loved
her
but
she
kept
on
saying
Do
it
quick
Do
it
I
still
hesitated
but
Alice
said
Come
now
do
it
Be
quick
I
could
not
so
she
said
since
she
could
not
go
home
again
and
we
could
not
marry
why
not
die
together
But
she
would
not
do
the
deed
herself
I
could
not
do
it
either
She
kept
urging
me
to
kill
her
so
at
last
I
shut
my
eyes
and
shot
her
and
then
I
shot
myself
before
I
saw
her
fall
I
saw
her
lying
on
the
floor
and
I
tried
to
run
away
after
I
got
up
and
I
ran
and
ran
and
ran
and
I
have
been
running
and
walking
ever
since
trying
to
forget
but
I
cannot
Sometimes
Alice
comes
to
me
but
I
always
say
No
I
am
the
cause
of
your
death
so
stay
away
from
me
I
ran
and
ran
to
get
away
from
the
police
and
everybody
else
A
while
ago
I
felt
I
was
an
old
woman
and
I
could
not
get
away
from
being
a
woman
for
a
long
time
I
got
away
but
after
a
while
I
was
that
old
woman
again
Dr
You
were
obsessing
somebody
at
that
time
Sp
Obsessing
What
do
you
mean
by
that
Dr
Did
you
ever
read
in
the
Bible
of
unclean
spirits
Sp
Yes
I
did
But
when
I
was
that
old
woman
I
wanted
to
die
and
I
could
not
I
could
not
get
rid
of
that
old
woman
hanging
around
me
either
I
could
not
get
her
away
from
me
I
don
t
want
to
be
around
that
old
woman
any
more
Excitedly
Oh
Alice
don
t
come
When
I
was
with
the
old
woman
there
were
such
sharp
sparks
like
lightning
on
me
I
thought
they
would
kill
me
and
I
wanted
to
die
The
patient
had
often
said
that
she
hoped
the
electrical
treatments
would
kill
her
They
seemed
to
be
like
a
streak
of
lightning
and
it
struck
me
but
I
did
not
die
Dr
Those
sparks
were
caused
by
static
electricity
which
was
given
to
one
of
our
patients
whom
you
have
evidently
been
obsessing
She
always
talked
of
dying
just
as
you
are
doing
you
have
been
controlling
her
and
ruining
her
life
The
electricity
drove
you
away
from
her
she
will
be
well
and
you
will
now
be
helped
When
you
leave
here
you
will
go
with
Alice
who
will
help
you
to
understand
your
condition
You
do
not
yet
realize
that
you
have
lost
your
physical
body
and
that
you
are
still
alive
Alice
is
a
spirit
just
as
you
are
You
are
an
invisible
spirit
and
are
controlling
my
wife
s
body
Spirit
and
mind
never
die
Sp
Do
you
think
I
shall
ever
find
peace
I
should
like
to
have
just
one
hour
of
peace
Dr
You
have
all
eternity
before
you
Sp
Will
I
be
forgiven
for
what
I
have
done
Dr
Your
own
confession
and
sorrow
are
sufficient
Be
patient
and
willing
to
learn
and
you
will
be
helped
Sp
There
s
my
mother
Spirit
Mother
I
am
not
worthy
to
be
called
your
son
I
loved
you
very
dearly
but
I
can
t
have
you
come
to
me
now
Weeping
Oh
Mother
will
you
forgive
me
I
love
you
still
Will
you
take
your
wayward
son
and
forgive
him
Will
you
give
me
happiness
for
a
little
while
I
have
suffered
oh
so
much
Please
take
me
with
you
if
you
can
forgive
me
My
own
mother
Dr
Does
your
mother
answer
you
Sp
Mother
says
My
son
my
son
a
mother
s
love
is
stronger
than
anything
else
I
have
tried
so
much
and
so
many
times
to
come
close
to
you
but
you
were
always
running
away
The
first
spirit
left

then
spoke

MRS
STEVENSON
I
am
now
united
with
my
dear
son
For
a
long
time
I
have
tried
to
come
in
close
touch
with
him
but
could
not
Each
time
that
I
thought
I
was
going
to
reach
him
he
would
run
away
from
me
He
has
seen
me
many
times
but
was
afraid
because
he
was
taught
the
false
doctrine
that
when
we
die
we
are
dead
and
that
is
why
people
are
afraid
of
the
dead
We
do
not
die
we
simply
pass
on
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
to
a
beautiful
condition
if
we
realize
the
truth
But
we
must
learn
much
regarding
the
next
life
while
we
are
on
earth
Study
your
own
life
and
yourself
because
if
you
do
not
you
will
be
like
my
dear
son
He
has
been
running
for
years
trying
to
get
away
from
me
and
his
sweetheart
and
also
from
every
policeman
he
has
seen
while
in
the
earth
sphere
He
has
been
obsessing
a
lady
for
some
time
and
he
had
to
stay
in
her
magnetic
aura
because
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
away
He
has
been
in
hell
not
a
hell
of
fire
but
a
hell
of
ignorance
Look
into
conditions
of
the
next
life
so
that
you
may
be
prepared
for
death
comes
when
it
is
not
expected
Be
prepared
not
by
belief
but
by
actual
knowledge
Find
out
what
is
beyond
the
veil
of
death
Then
when
the
time
comes
for
you
to
go
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
you
will
go
with
open
eyes
and
know
where
you
are
going
and
you
will
not
be
like
my
poor
son
an
earthbound
spirit
My
poor
boy
He
is
so
tired
and
worried
he
is
sick
men
tally
I
will
nurse
him
and
teach
him
of
the
life
everlasting
so
that
he
can
realize
the
beautiful
condition
in
the
spirit
world
Do
not
merely
believe
if
you
only
believe
you
will
stay
just
where
you
are
We
must
all
practice
the
Golden
Rule
to
live
for
others
and
serve
others
then
we
will
attain
happiness
when
we
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
Thank
you
for
the
help
you
have
given
my
son
A
mother
s
love
is
strong
and
when
you
see
my
boy
again
he
will
be
better
because
all
doubt
will
be
gone
Doubt
is
a
wall
it
is
a
wall
we
build
for
ourselves
between
life
and
death
and
that
doubt
can
never
bring
mother
and
son
together
He
ran
away
from
me
whenever
he
saw
me
and
neither
Alice
nor
I
could
come
near
him
He
thought
he
was
alive
and
that
he
had
not
killed
himself
Some
time
ago
he
came
in
contact
with
a
sensitive
person
a
woman
and
has
been
obsessing
her
but
he
thought
he
was
in
prison
I
thank
you
all
tonight
for
the
help
given
my
son
and
may
God
bless
you
for
the
work
you
are
doing
Goodbye
CHAPTER

Spirits
and
Narcotics
Inebriety
Amnesia
RELENTLESS
as
is
the
grip
which
the
drug
habit
holds
on
its
mortal
victims
the
power
of
narcotics
extends
even
more
tyrannically
beyond
the
grave
The
desire
is
implanted
in
the
very
soul
itself
and
the
agony
of
earthbound
spirits
whose
cravings
for
gratification
are
in
vain
is
beyond
description
Such
spirits
frequently
obtain
partial
satisfaction
through
controlling
mortal
sensitives
and
forcing
them
to
become
addicts
of
some
drug
Often
spirits
suffering
from
the
narcotic
evil
have
come
to
our
circle
and
many
urgent
warnings
have
been
given
by
discarnate
intelligences
who
were
formerly
subject
to
this
slavery
Twenty
five
years
after
the
first
conversation
with
Minnie
Morgan
which
occurred
during
my
dissecting
work
this
spirit
who
had
been
a
morphine
fiend
returned
and
told
of
earth
sphere
conditions
as
well
as
of
the
higher
spirit
world

Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
feel
that
I
am
one
of
you
although
I
do
not
know
you
I
was
helped
by
you
I
certainly
had
wonderful
help
in
being
brought
to
understand
that
there
is
a
real
life
In
the
spirit
world
we
know
each
other
as
we
should
be
known
not
as
you
know
each
other
in
earth
life
with
all
kinds
of
hidden
thoughts
You
wander
like
wild
cattle
on
the
battle
field
of
selfishness
and
jealousy
Love
is
so
little
understood
You
do
not
know
what
real
love
is
because
God
is
Love
and
God
dwells
in
Love
The
majority
of
people
only
believe
and
think
there
is
some
place
in
the
sky
to
which
they
go
when
they
die
Whenever
I
gave
that
subject
any
thought
I
made
up
my
mind
that
I
would
have
a
good
time
while
I
could
and
then
when
the
time
came
to
die
I
would
be
ready
to
go
because
at
the
last
I
could
throw
my
sins
on
Jesus
and
be
washed
as
white
as
snow
I
started
out
in
life
with
that
belief
I
said
See
Chap
Page
Spirit
Minnie
Morgan
Why
can
t
I
have
a
good
time
like
others
The
future
will
take
care
of
itself
With
that
thought
many
persons
go
out
to
sow
their
wild
oats
thinking
that
when
the
proper
time
comes
they
will
be
prayed
for
and
that
then
they
will
step
into
the
glory
of
Heaven
That
is
what
I
thought
I
tried
to
live
a
life
of
glory
or
what
I
thought
was
glory
What
does
that
mean
It
means
to
have
a
good
time
to
live
and
not
care
what
becomes
of
one
s
soul
I
said
Let
us
have
a
good
time
while
we
can
and
I
started
out
in
life
that
way
I
had
my
sorrows
and
I
had
my
good
time
as
I
called
it
but
that
is
not
a
good
time
We
cannot
for
one
minute
step
over
the
laws
of
nature
except
we
suffer
in
some
way
or
other
If
we
go
too
far
in
anything
we
suffer
for
it
both
mentally
and
physically
We
keep
on
going
and
going
sometimes
our
good
time
is
better
sometimes
worse
I
lived
a
very
fast
life
and
called
it
a
glorious
time
but
grief
and
adversity
came
In
the
way
of
the
world
I
lived
very
fast
I
went
to
church
once
in
a
while
to
be
sure
my
soul
would
be
taken
care
of
I
paid
money
to
the
church
so
I
would
be
all
right
and
then
I
drowned
myself
in
the
glory
of
the
world
It
was
all
right
for
a
while
Each
time
I
had
glory
as
I
called
it
I
suffered
both
physically
and
mentally
I
tried
to
shake
it
off
and
go
on
a
little
longer
I
fell
by
the
wayside
After
a
while
my
physical
body
wore
out
and
I
had
misery
and
sickness
At
one
time
I
was
considered
a
very
pretty
girl
I
had
my
beaux
and
all
that
goes
with
a
good
time
but
I
went
down
and
down
to
the
very
lowest
I
was
a
physical
wreck
but
I
was
still
on
earth
Never
let
any
one
give
you
the
least
bit
of
morphine
When
you
start
on
that
road
you
are
lost
Not
that
a
soul
is
ever
lost
but
you
are
lost
for
a
time
while
you
are
a
slave
to
the
drug
You
suffer
agony
There
is
nothing
worse
than
to
crave
morphine
and
be
unable
to
get
it
It
seems
like
every
nerve
in
your
body
is
creeping
I
got
wild
because
I
could
not
get
it
I
did
not
care
for
anything
I
would
have
sold
my
very
soul
if
I
could
only
have
gotten
morphine
I
lost
all
decency
I
lost
everything
All
I
wanted
was
morphine
It
was
terrible
It
burned
to
my
very
heart
I
felt
it
in
every
nerve
and
I
felt
as
if
I
were
on
fire
If
only
some
one
would
have
gotten
morphine
for
me
Just
a
little
Just
a
little
bit
A
little
bit
I
felt
I
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
I
wanted
just
a
little
a
little
bit
Only
a
little
The
spirit
seemed
to
live
again
all
the
agony
she
had
endured
when
in
earth
life
It
also
seemed
evident
that
in
addition
to
the
visible
circle
of
investigators
she
was
addressing
an
audience
of
earthbound
spirits
I
died
in
that
terrible
condition
My
physical
body
was
gone
I
had
worn
it
out
just
worn
it
out
Then
I
was
operated
on
post
mortem
but
I
still
lived
I
wanted
to
get
to
my
body
They
operated
on
me
and
after
a
while
I
felt
that
something
was
picking
me
to
small
pieces
Dissection
I
cried
and
I
fought
because
I
wanted
that
body
so
I
could
satisfy
my
very
soul
I
was
burning
up
They
picked
at
every
nerve
they
looked
at
my
heart
my
shoulder
and
down
to
the
leg
pick
pick
pick
all
the
time
I
got
so
desperate
I
fought
with
all
my
power
and
I
seared
some
away
from
my
body
They
never
touched
it
again
There
were
five
or
six
men
with
knives
all
wanting
to
do
something
with
my
body
pick
pick
pick
But
there
came
another
he
looked
and
looked
at
me
and
picked
and
picked
and
he
drove
me
wild
I
thought
if
I
could
only
get
hold
of
him
I
would
fix
him
He
paid
no
attention
to
me
I
tried
to
scare
him
as
I
had
seared
the
others
but
I
could
not
budge
him
He
would
not
move
one
inch
from
that
body
of
mine
I
followed
him
and
thought
I
would
haunt
him
but
all
at
once
I
got
well
controlled
the
psychic
and
began
to
fight
him
with
all
the
strength
and
power
I
had
for
picking
me
to
pieces
To
my
great
surprise
after
this
gentleman
Dr
W
talked
to
me
I
found
I
was
dead
I
did
not
know
I
had
lost
my
body
for
I
had
not
been
dead
at
all
This
gentleman
told
me
that
the
people
working
on
my
body
were
students
and
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
work
on
a
dead
body
before
they
were
able
to
pass
their
examinations
I
seared
five
of
them
and
they
never
touched
me
again
but
I
could
not
scare
this
one
To
Dr
W
Now
I
come
to
thank
you
You
were
the
one
who
enlightened
me
and
gave
me
an
understanding
of
the
real
life
beyond
I
found
I
could
not
throw
my
sins
on
Christ
He
was
our
teacher
but
we
must
live
our
own
lives
as
He
taught
us
to
live
and
not
throw
our
sins
and
troubles
on
Him
That
is
a
false
doctrine
He
is
the
Life
the
Light
and
theWay
He
said
I
am
the
Light
of
the
world
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
darkness
Many
others
before
Him
taught
the
same
lesson
of
life
I
found
that
in
the
past
there
had
been
many
teachers
like
Christ
Confucius
was
one
He
taught
the
same
as
did
Christ
In
the
Old
Testament
we
find
the
same
principles
as
Christ
taught
His
sayings
are
the
same
in
the
Old
as
in
the
New
Let
us
all
do
what
we
can
to
find
God
within
us
Learn
to
live
according
to
Christ
s
teachings
Love
the
Lord
thy
God
with
all
thy
heart
and
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
I
would
not
have
the
home
in
the
spirit
world
that
I
have
if
I
had
not
been
disturbed
and
received
an
understanding
of
the
real
life
I
was
very
wicked
and
you
know
the
desire
I
had
for
morphine
That
desire
was
with
me
even
after
I
left
my
body
The
desire
for
anything
belongs
to
the
soul
not
to
the
body
The
body
is
only
a
cloak
or
dress
for
your
soul
All
the
desires
of
life
all
the
faculties
that
belong
to
the
soul
go
with
you
to
the
grave
and
beyond
the
grave
What
would
I
have
been
if
I
had
not
been
given
an
understanding
of
how
to
overcome
my
desires
I
would
have
been
an
earthbound
spirit
and
would
have
gotten
into
some
sensitive
person
s
magnetism
and
made
that
sensitive
a
morphine
fiend
so
I
could
have
had
my
desire
fulfilled
and
the
life
of
the
sensitive
would
have
been
ruined
I
would
have
lived
in
the
earth
sphere
for
years
and
years
if
I
had
gotten
into
that
condition
I
would
have
ruined
one
and
then
another
and
so
I
would
have
kept
on
Find
out
what
belongs
to
the
soul
and
what
belongs
to
the
body
If
this
were
done
we
would
not
have
so
much
trouble
and
crime
nor
so
much
sickness
We
would
have
Love
and
Heaven
on
earth
because
we
would
have
pity
for
the
unfortunate
ones
who
are
living
just
for
their
own
desires
It
says
in
the
Bible
Prove
all
things
hold
fast
that
which
is
good
That
means
do
not
have
any
desire
for
anything
If
you
use
too
much
of
anything
in
this
earth
life
such
as
morphine
whiskey
or
tobacco
then
you
are
a
slave
and
must
stop
its
use
Many
people
condemn
many
things
and
that
thought
of
condemnation
is
very
hard
for
a
sensitive
person
Everything
on
earth
is
meant
for
us
to
use
but
not
misuse
Many
people
condemn
liquor
tobacco
morphine
opium
but
it
is
their
misuse
which
should
be
condemned
They
are
all
necessary
things
if
they
are
used
rightly
Isn
t
an
opiate
a
good
thing
if
you
must
undergo
an
operation
To
be
operated
upon
without
an
opiate
would
be
wrong
the
suffering
would
be
too
great
Opiates
help
pain
Many
people
use
these
things
because
they
are
forbidden
They
say
Forbidden
fruit
tastes
best
When
things
are
forbidden
everybody
wants
them
and
they
ruin
themselves
using
them
I
lived
in
the
lower
world
the
underworld
and
I
know
what
I
am
talking
about
I
took
anything
to
keep
my
nerves
quiet
Anything
used
moderately
in
a
sensible
way
is
all
right
When
a
man
who
works
very
hard
either
physically
or
mentally
sits
down
to
rest
he
is
nervous
and
fatigued
Give
him
a
good
cigar
and
let
him
relax
His
nervousness
goes
and
he
becomes
stronger
It
is
a
thorough
relaxation
he
smokes
and
feels
better
With
this
complete
relaxation
comes
quietude
the
man
sleeps
and
is
rested
for
his
work
the
next
day
If
people
would
have
more
love
for
each
other
and
less
condemnation
they
would
be
more
like
brothers
and
sisters
That
is
the
life
in
the
higher
realms
We
cannot
reach
that
stage
until
we
have
gotten
rid
of
all
desires
all
hatred
all
selfishness
all
envy
We
cannot
progress
until
we
have
thrown
away
all
these
things
and
said
God
help
me
to
love
my
enemies
and
friends
better
than
myself
Then
we
will
be
ready
to
travel
the
road
Some
people
think
that
after
they
learn
the
lesson
of
truth
they
will
step
into
the
glory
of
Heaven
But
Heaven
is
a
condition
In
conquering
my
desire
for
morphine
I
had
to
do
so
little
by
little
step
by
step
until
I
could
say
No
more
morphine
for
me
After
I
had
conquered
my
friends
and
relatives
met
me
and
said
Now
you
are
ready
to
come
with
us
to
the
home
that
has
been
prepared
for
you
Before
that
time
I
had
to
live
all
by
myself
I
was
not
in
a
dark
dungeon
like
some
are
but
all
around
me
was
myself
nothing
else
I
had
to
learn
and
strive
to
overcome
It
says
in
the
Big
Book
that
Christ
went
to
the
lower
spheres
to
give
help
and
teach
We
all
have
to
teach
and
help
the
fallen
ones
and
give
them
strength
to
overcome
their
desires
I
wish
I
could
take
you
along
with
me
for
a
few
moments
to
see
the
conditions
in
the
lower
sphere
what
they
call
the
earth
sphere
Here
is
the
sphere
of
whiskey
here
the
sphere
of
morphine
here
the
sphere
of
the
opium
fiend
here
the
sphere
of
selfishness
and
here
the
sphere
of
misers
Of
all
these
conditions
that
of
the
miser
is
the
worst
He
sacrifices
everything
for
money
He
will
not
eat
because
he
thinks
he
cannot
afford
it
He
starves
his
mind
because
he
wants
money
money
and
what
is
the
result
In
the
earth
sphere
he
is
in
the
dark
but
he
sees
his
money
being
spent
and
he
is
in
hell
He
suffers
terribly
He
sees
his
relatives
get
his
money
it
is
divided
some
going
here
some
there
If
it
were
all
in
one
place
he
could
count
it
over
and
that
would
be
all
right
but
his
relatives
all
want
their
share
to
spend
Now
imagine
that
money
has
been
his
treasure
Each
cent
that
is
spent
is
like
cutting
a
piece
from
his
body
because
his
whole
mind
and
soul
were
in
that
money
and
to
see
it
scattered
and
spent
is
hell
for
him
Think
what
that
means
to
him
He
cannot
be
helped
until
he
feels
that
he
no
longer
wants
his
money
then
his
soul
or
better
nature
will
open
up
and
he
will
be
helped
He
will
be
under
the
guidance
of
a
teacher
and
will
be
taught
that
money
belongs
to
the
earth
life
not
to
the
spirit
He
then
has
to
do
good
A
miser
never
gets
his
money
in
the
right
way
He
may
not
be
a
thief
but
if
he
loans
money
he
charges
too
high
a
rate
of
interest
For
every
cent
he
got
in
the
wrong
way
he
has
to
do
right
He
must
do
some
kind
act
and
help
poor
people
in
their
work
He
has
to
lay
down
his
life
and
earn
everything
before
he
can
gain
happiness
in
the
spirit
world
He
has
to
serve
first
and
he
must
help
those
from
whom
he
took
money
to
get
it
back
You
know
a
sin
against
the
Holy
Ghost
cannot
be
forgiven
It
must
be
atoned
for
That
is
his
life
in
the
spirit
world
We
have
to
look
at
a
murderer
differently
There
are
ten
different
degrees
of
murder
There
is
murder
by
quick
temper
that
is
not
real
murder
It
is
committed
under
stress
of
strong
quick
temper
At
heart
the
man
is
not
a
murderer
he
simply
lost
control
of
his
temper
Of
course
he
has
to
suffer
and
do
good
where
he
did
wrong
Temper
is
a
very
hard
thing
to
conquer
but
it
must
be
conquered
because
it
kills
our
better
nature
and
makes
us
do
many
wrong
and
unkind
things
Then
we
have
the
cunning
murderer
He
plans
and
schemes
he
wants
a
man
s
money
He
is
nice
and
sweet
and
goes
to
church
He
plans
and
schemes
to
get
that
man
s
life
in
some
way
or
another
but
he
does
it
slowly
He
has
evil
thoughts
In
the
spirit
world
this
man
has
to
suffer
a
great
deal
and
must
atone
for
his
actions
from
the
time
he
began
to
plan
and
scheme
to
murder
Then
there
is
the
psychic
sensitive
who
does
not
care
for
anybody
He
doesn
t
belong
to
one
church
or
another
he
takes
things
easy
What
is
not
done
today
can
be
done
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
He
does
not
use
his
will
A
cunning
spirit
gets
into
this
man
s
magnetic
aura
and
controls
him
He
commits
some
crime
The
man
will
hang
for
his
deed
but
he
never
did
it
He
will
probably
say
he
does
not
know
that
he
did
anything
Or
he
may
say
I
must
have
been
drunk
when
I
did
it
for
I
don
t
remember
anything
about
it
But
it
was
not
liquor
that
did
it
Liquor
never
does
that
When
a
man
is
drunk
his
mind
is
in
a
stupor
It
is
a
spirit
that
does
the
work
If
that
spirit
has
been
wronged
in
life
all
he
wants
is
revenge
The
law
does
not
really
find
out
whether
the
man
is
guilty
or
not
he
is
hung
The
majority
of
murders
and
hold
ups
are
committed
by
spirits
They
scheme
and
scheme
and
use
mortals
as
tools
until
they
wake
up
and
realize
what
wrong
they
have
been
doing
Often
honesty
and
modesty
have
both
been
killed
When
I
was
a
child
I
was
very
modest
but
when
I
killed
modesty
I
was
ruined
Then
I
did
not
care
for
anything
Honesty
is
a
virtue
we
should
all
cultivate
Judges
lawyers
and
ministers
in
the
majority
of
cases
do
not
give
justice
they
look
for
gain
They
kill
justice
honesty
and
truth
Let
us
do
all
we
can
to
keep
those
three
to
the
front
Honesty
and
truth
will
convert
the
world
You
cannot
convert
it
by
condemnation
People
are
not
taught
the
truth
Have
wisdom
and
human
kindness
and
you
will
see
better
results
Teach
wisdom
and
let
more
of
the
Christ
spirit
be
in
every
one
Live
as
He
taught
do
as
He
did
then
happiness
will
reign
I
am
sorry
to
have
taken
up
so
much
time
but
I
did
not
know
I
would
talk
so
long
Even
now
I
feel
I
have
more
to
say
but
I
must
stop
My
name
when
I
lived
in
Chicago
was
Minnie
Morgan
but
that
name
does
not
belong
to
me
and
I
do
not
want
it
any
more
That
name
has
a
horror
for
me
Even
when
I
repeat
that
name
I
feel
a
horror
of
it
My
own
name
is
not
to
be
given
tonight
We
have
to
earn
our
names
and
I
have
no
name
until
I
have
earned
it
After
all
these
twenty
five
years
it
was
in
that
I
passed
out
I
have
not
advanced
sufficiently
to
have
even
a
name
I
am
happy
and
I
will
earn
a
name
and
then
I
will
be
called
by
it
My
name
was
down
in
the
very
lowest
place
If
any
one
of
you
should
pass
out
you
would
have
a
name
that
is
honest
and
good
Your
name
will
follow
you
and
you
will
want
it
I
would
not
cling
to
mine
for
it
has
such
a
horror
for
me
Can
you
see
the
difference
When
you
have
done
the
best
you
could
in
earth
life
you
have
traveled
the
right
road
and
when
you
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
your
relatives
and
friends
will
meet
you
I
had
no
one
to
meet
me
No
friends
came
I
had
gone
too
low
My
friend
was
morphine
Isn
t
that
a
terrible
condition
You
know
when
I
wanted
morphine
I
did
not
always
get
it
in
the
right
way
During
my
earth
life
I
sometimes
stole
money
to
get
morphine
Now
I
have
to
do
good
step
by
step
I
have
been
doing
work
in
the
slums
helping
those
as
unfortunate
as
I
had
been
I
lived
with
those
who
craved
morphine
Now
I
can
help
them
to
overcome
their
desire
for
it
That
is
my
work
It
is
not
pleasant
but
I
have
to
do
it
Some
one
has
to
do
it
so
why
not
I
I
suffer
with
them
I
can
give
them
sympathy
for
I
too
have
suffered
Give
these
unfortunate
ones
your
sympathy
and
loving
thoughts
for
it
will
help
them
You
have
not
lived
as
they
have
and
you
do
not
know
what
their
condition
means
Each
one
that
I
help
to
the
right
road
is
Heaven
to
me
Remember
each
one
is
Heaven
to
me
The
more
I
help
the
more
happiness
I
find
Some
day
I
shall
say
goodbye
to
this
condition
and
progress
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
Do
not
condemn
those
who
have
fallen
remember
they
have
no
will
of
their
own
Send
kind
thoughts
to
them
and
say
a
prayer
God
help
them
to
have
a
will
of
their
own
to
overcome
their
desire
Send
out
thoughts
to
help
them
overcome
do
not
send
evil
unkind
thoughts
The
next
time
I
come
you
will
know
what
my
name
is
because
by
that
time
I
shall
have
earned
it
Thank
you
for
helping
me
to
the
right
road
because
I
am
happy
in
helping
others
but
I
shall
have
a
hard
climb
to
find
bliss
Good
Night
and
I
again
thank
you
for
having
helped
me
The
day
after
receiving
a
request
by
telephone
from
an
adjoining
city
that
we
concentrate
for
a
pharmacist
who
was
a
drug
addict
and
evidently
obsessed
the
spirit
of
a
morphine
fiend
was
removed
from
him
and
brought
to
our
circle
an
entity
in
torment
convulsed
with
the
drug
craving
and
wildly
begging
for
just
one
grain

I
am
Frank
Noble
I
have
been
trying
very
hard
for
some
time
to
bring
my
wife
here
for
help
Doctor
It
must
have
required
a
good
deal
of
patience
on
your
part
Sp
Thank
you
for
bringing
her
to
me
Dr
We
are
glad
to
have
been
of
any
help
Sp
My
wife
was
very
sick
Once
the
doctor
gave
her
morphine
to
help
her
pain
and
from
that
time
she
had
spells
so
severe
that
we
could
do
nothing
but
call
the
doctor
to
give
her
morphine
It
was
an
awful
habit
to
get
into
Many
many
times
she
played
sick
I
know
when
she
wanted
morphine
She
had
played
that
game
so
long
that
it
really
was
very
easy
for
her
to
play
sick
to
scare
us
all
and
to
ask
for
morphine
What
could
a
fellow
do
After
she
had
it
she
would
be
well
sometimes
for
whole
weeks
and
sometimes
for
a
month
The
spells
she
had
were
very
bad
Dr
Where
did
you
live
Sp
We
came
from
El
Paso
Texas
Dr
Do
you
know
when
you
passed
out
Sp
No
I
can
t
tell
you
It
has
been
very
strange
for
me
I
had
a
hard
time
Of
course
I
was
not
a
rich
man
I
had
to
earn
my
living
doing
what
I
could
Dr
That
is
no
disgrace
Sp
I
had
no
education
so
had
to
do
whatever
I
could
Sometimes
I
worked
at
mining
other
times
I
worked
in
the
woods
and
sometimes
I
was
a
carpenter
I
did
anything
to
keep
my
home
together
At
one
time
Elizabeth
was
a
very
good
girl
One
time
when
she
had
a
child
she
was
very
sick
and
in
great
pain
The
doctor
gave
her
pills
and
after
a
while
she
wanted
more
and
more
and
at
last
she
went
insane
over
morphine
She
was
very
hard
to
get
along
with
until
she
got
it
and
after
that
she
was
happy
and
she
would
not
have
another
spell
for
a
while
The
habit
grew
on
her
She
had
bad
coughing
spells
and
she
died
in
one
of
them
She
took
a
pill
and
in
some
way
or
other
she
choked
to
death
She
went
through
the
death
scene
here
tonight
Dr
She
would
have
coughed
a
great
deal
more
if
I
had
not
checked
her
Sp
For
a
long
time
I
tried
to
find
her
but
when
I
came
near
her
she
ran
away
and
only
called
for
morphine
Once
in
a
while
I
lost
her
completely
and
I
did
not
know
where
she
was
It
is
strange
When
you
think
of
people
you
are
right
with
them
Finally
I
was
always
able
to
find
my
wife
whenever
I
lost
her
Sometimes
she
got
into
another
person
I
found
her
again
but
she
was
so
afraid
of
me
I
died
before
she
did
Dr
Did
you
have
any
knowledge
of
the
spirit
world
before
you
passed
on
Sp
My
mother
was
a
medium
and
I
learned
the
truth
from
her
Elizabeth
would
never
believe
it
because
she
was
a
Methodist
She
thought
I
would
go
to
hell
because
I
believed
in
Spiritualism
Look
into
the
truth
and
you
will
be
much
better
off
Do
not
have
creeds
dogmas
or
doubts
Thank
you
for
helping
us
because
when
my
wife
gets
out
of
this
stupor
she
is
in
she
will
be
better
They
put
her
to
sleep
under
morphine
when
she
was
in
the
hospital
Now
she
will
not
bother
others
any
more
and
we
shall
be
together
Thank
you
for
helping
us
Good
night
The
spirit
of
Olive
T
who
had
controlled
the
psychic
upon
several
occasions
returned
one
evening
and
speaking
of
the
real
happiness
of
service
urged
that
all
those
subject
to
the
temptations
of
society
life
and
the
excitement
of
the
movie
world
be
warned
against
the
use
of
drugs
and
asked
if
she
might
bring
in
a
spirit
who
was
in
trouble
and
needed
to
be
awakened
A
spirit
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
drowsy
state
then
controlled
the
psychic
collapsing
weakly
but
when
spoken
to
began
to
struggle
desperately
as
if
in
the
throes
of
great
pain
and
agony

you
did

the
influence

You
must

realize
that
You
are

people
call
dead
But
you
are
not
actually
dead
you
have
only
lost
your
physical

motioned
languidly
as
if
noticing
a
group
of
invisibles
Dr
Whom
do
you
see
Endeavor

Understand
you
no

again
stretched
out
his

I
am
going
to
die
Dr
You
have
already
done
that
as
much

ever

lost

Sp
Yes
but
I
am

Dr
You
cannot

Sp
I
see
so
many
who
have
died
Dr
They
are
not
actually
dead
at
all
They
are
spirits
like
yourself
You
have
already
passed
out
of
your
mortal
body
You
are
a
spirit
but
do
not
understand
the
fact
This
body
which
you
are
using
is
not
yours
You
have
lost
your
body
and
have
not
wakened
to
your
real
condition
Friends
have
brought
you
here
for
help
But
the
spirit
could
not
be
roused
again
and
was
taken
away
One
of
the
guiding
intelligences
then
came
in
and
said
The
other
spirit
was
so
tired
that
we
could
not
waken
him
but
now
we
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
him
He
is
so
weak
He
has
not
overcome
his
old
habit
We
brought
him
here
so
that
we
could
take
him
to
the
spirit
world
Olive
T
and
others
work
to
help
the
ones
who
are
in
that
particular
trouble
earthbound
spirits
who
have
the
craving
for
morphine
Often
people
do
not
have
the
habit
but
they
are
influenced
by
spirits
who
have
the
craving
and
who
get
into
their
magnetic
auras
Many
persons
are
easily
influenced
because
they
live
such
nervous
sensitive
lives
that
they
are
half
in
spirit
They
then
become
influenced
by
earthbound
spirits
who
are
so
much
in
earth
life
that
they
obsess
people
We
are
going
to
help
this
young
man
and
sometime
he
will
come
again
when
he
is
stronger
and
tell
his
experience
but
he
cannot
talk
tonight
He
has
gradually
been
awakening
for
some
time
but
he
is
still
bewildered
and
he
could
not
realize
the
higher
life
He
has
been
in
many
places
and
with
his
wife
much
of
the
time
She
helped
him
in
fighting
his
habit
but
he
was
too
weak
to
properly
understand
He
had
no
resistive
power
left
After
he
passed
out
his
spirit
was
in
a
kind
of
sleep
from
morphine
Still
he
has
been
wandering
in
a
twilight
state
on
earth
life
to
find
his
home
and
family
and
trying
to
realize
where
he
was
He
thought
he
was
lost
We
have
tried
to
reach
him
from
our
side
of
life
but
it
has
been
very
hard
We
will
now
take
care
of
him
One
week
later
the
spirit
of
Wallace
R
returned
somewhat
stronger
and
telling
of
his
suffering
made
an
anguished
appeal
to
others
to
overcome
the

not

I
wanted

come

get
a
little
more
understanding
I
could
not
get
much
the
last
time
I
am
in
the
dark
I
am
in
the
darkness
having
to
overcome
my
physical
habit
which
is
attached
to
the
soul
Dr
Have
you
been
here
before
Sp
Yes
I
was
here
not
long
ago
and
I
thank
you
for
helping
me
but
I
need
more
help
Please
give
me
strength
to
overcome
my
physical
habit
of
using
drugs
I
had
little
understanding
of
the
life
hereafter
I
lived
from
day
to
day
the
life
of
the
world
I
did
not
realize
what
it
would
mean
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
life
Dr
Very
few
interest
themselves
in
higher
things
Sp
I
also
want
to
thank
you
for
having
helped
me
during
the
time
I
was
sick
At
that
time
I
felt
such
a
strong
power
trying
to
help
me
to
overcome
and
trying
to
give
me
strength
I
felt
drawn
somewhere
but
I
was
too
weak
to
realize
the
power
that
was
sent
out
to
help
me
Dr
We
concentrated
for
you
during
the
time
you
were
sick
as
we
thought
there
might
be
some
obsession
there
SP
I
was
too
weak
to
realize
Dr
Of
course
you
did
not
understand
SP
I
had
no
power
and
there
was
no
battery
at
our
end
to
help
me
My
only
hope
was
to
try
to
conquer
I
was
in
such
misery
and
so
helpless
that
many
spirits
demonstrated
through
me
and
I
had
no
one
who
understood
how
to
help
me
conquer
the
soul
craving
The
spirit
kept
the
hands
across
the
chest
and
constantly
twisted
the
fingers
one
over
the
other
People
think
when
they
take
drugs
that
the
habit
will
end
when
they
pass
out
of
the
physical
I
tried
to
conquer
but
when
my
mortal
body
had
gone
and
my
dear
noble
wife
could
not
be
with
me
to
help
me
battle
in
the
hard
struggle
I
seemed
helpless
She
is
a
dear
noble
soul
she
stood
by
me
and
helped
me
but
I
had
not
the
power
to
conquer
After
I
had
lost
all
the
surroundings
of
earth
I
went
into
a
kind
of
sleep
for
awhile
but
oh
how
I
longed
for
my
wife
and
children
Also
how
I
longed
to
conquer
but
could
not
I
suffered
writhing
painfully
oh
how
I
suffered
I
tried
to
go
somewhere
to
get
help
to
get
help
to
overcome
but
I
must
thank
you
you
gave
me
both
strength
and
power
I
wish
I
could
have
had
more
power
from
your
good
thoughts
Since
last
I
was
here
I
have
gained
much
I
am
not
strong
yet
but
I
am
able
to
see
and
realize
how
I
can
win
my
battle
From
the
little
I
have
seen
of
the
spirit
world
since
I
was
here
last
I
realize
how
wonderful
things
are
Earnestly
I
wish
I
could
warn
many
I
knew
and
tell
them
not
to
play
with
drugs
They
think
it
is
fun
in
the
beginning
but
how
they
will
have
to
suffer
at
the
last
Even
the
soul
burns
from
the
craving
They
should
do
everything
they
can
to
over
come
the
habit
They
not
only
suffer
here
but
they
suffer
terribly
after
they
pass
out
then
the
soul
is
on
fire
With
an
agonized
expression
hands
and
fingers
working
nervously
Many
yes
many
come
back
and
try
to
get
the
drug
try
to
get
even
a
little
and
they
ruin
others
against
their
will
I
knew
many
times
that
I
myself
did
not
want
it
but
there
was
such
a
strong
power
back
of
me
Obsession
If
the
world
could
only
know
My
dear
noble
wife
is
trying
very
hard
to
warn
others
so
they
will
not
meet
the
same
fate
and
death
I
did
It
was
awful
After
the
death
of
Wallace
R
his
wife
Mrs
R
played
a
leading
role
in
a
moving
picture
which
vividly
portrayed
the
horrors
of
the
narcotic
evil
Thanks
to
you
here
I
have
found
relief
I
feel
better
I
will
gain
now
I
have
opened
my
soul
s
eyes
and
I
find
there
are
great
possibilities
for
me
and
in
time
there
will
be
relief
for
me
Oh
if
I
could
only
warn
and
help
others
So
many
are
taking
that
deadly
drug
They
think
they
can
forget
sorrow
and
gain
strength
from
the
drug
They
do
for
a
while
but
it
only
lasts
a
little
time
then
it
is
worse
They
take
it
a
second
time
and
it
is
a
little
worse
a
third
time
still
worse
and
so
on
When
people
drink
whiskey
it
makes
them
drunk
but
after
a
good
sleep
they
get
over
it
and
they
do
not
have
the
terrible
craving
that
they
do
from
drugs
The
world
will
go
mad
if
the
narcotic
evil
is
not
stopped
soon
Shutting
out
liquor
did
great
harm
because
people
must
have
a
stimulant
of
some
kind
They
work
hard
very
hard
in
the
movies
and
it
is
nerve
racking
work
As
I
said
they
must
have
something
to
stimulate
their
nerves
so
they
can
go
on
If
they
took
some
wine
or
beer
or
even
some
whiskey
to
quiet
their
nerves
it
would
not
be
such
a
detriment
as
morphine
is
Most
of
them
use
morphine
and
oh
moaning
in
anguish
if
I
could
only
come
back
and
warn
them
If
only
they
would
believe
me
I
would
tell
them
to
overcome
and
let
them
know
what
a
terrible
thing
it
is
to
be
a
slave
to
a
drug
If
they
only
would
realize
what
is
beyond
they
would
never
use
drugs
Dr
The
condition
of
the
spirits
who
have
taken
drugs
during
earth
life
must
be
terrible
on
the
other
side
Sp
Shuddering
I
don
t
want
to
go
there
The
earth
sphere
I
saw
one
glimpse
of
it
Thank
you
for
concentrating
for
me
it
has
been
of
such
help
I
was
weak
but
through
your
concentration
they
have
been
able
to
help
me
on
this
side
and
give
me
strength
and
also
to
put
me
to
sleep
so
I
can
gain
strength
I
was
trying
to
come
back
somewhere
to
get
help
at
some
psychic
circle
but
I
could
not
do
very
much
I
did
not
understand
then
Since
I
was
here
the
last
time
and
you
talked
to
me
I
am
stronger
and
I
have
come
now
to
thank
you
and
to
say
I
am
on
the
way
to
health
and
happiness
I
wish
I
had
know
about
you
when
I
was
first
taken
sick
I
could
probably
have
overcome
and
conquered
If
I
could
only
talk
to
my
dear
noble
wife
and
thank
her
for
helping
me
and
for
trying
to
warn
others
who
are
on
the
same
road
I
was
I
will
conquer
now
and
then
I
want
the
world
to
know
I
want
to
warn
the
grown
ups
to
warn
children
to
warn
young
men
to
warn
young
women
to
never
never
start
taking
that
deadly
drug
I
would
rather
have
pain
than
take
it
For
a
while
it
kills
pain
then
opens
the
wound
worse
than
ever
You
do
not
know
how
terrible
the
suffering
is
I
could
not
tell
You
If
I
were
burning
in
hell
it
could
not
be
worse
than
having
every
nerve
in
my
body
burning
It
drives
one
mad
No
one
can
realize
it
except
through
experience
Dr
The
spirit
friends
can
help
you
Sp
I
have
help
now
and
I
do
thank
you
Next
time
if
I
can
come
again
I
may
be
able
to
tell
of
my
progression
in
the
other
world
I
have
seen
very
little
but
I
will
learn
I
am
in
a
school
a
hospital
where
I
am
learning
to
overcome
People
think
that
when
they
die
all
troubles
will
be
ended
That
is
the
first
time
you
really
live
and
all
your
desires
and
cravings
are
with
you
because
they
belong
to
the
soul
not
the
body
The
body
is
only
the
dress
Now
I
am
in
school
to
learn
the
lessons
of
life
from
the
real
standpoint
and
I
am
learning
Thank
you
all
for
helping
me
and
also
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
of
learning
the
lessons
of
life
I
wish
many
places
had
circles
like
this
to
help
spirits
in
darkness
Some
time
send
my
love
to
my
dear
noble
wife
I
will
try
when
I
am
stronger
to
impress
her
that
I
am
there
with
her
Dr
Be
brave
and
forget
all
about
your
trouble
Let
the
Mercy
Band
of
Spirit
Forces
help
you
then
you
will
gradually
overcome
Sp
Yes
I
will
and
thank
you

Spirits
of

Victims
of
such
obsession
have
been
brought
to
our
observation
the
most
recent
case
being
that
of
Mrs
V
a
periodic
inebriate
who
for
some
time
had
endeavored
in
vain
to
overcome
the
tendency
to
drink
Having
again
failed
to
conquer
this
irresistible
impulse
she
came
to
us
one
evening
strongly
under
the
influence
of
liquor
and
asked
to
be
given
a
treatment
After
her
departure
we
held
a
concentration
circle
when

I

been
a
woman
once
in

And
through
that
woman
you
got
the
whiskey
You
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself

are
not
satisfied
with
abusing
yourself

you
must
also
control
a

Why
should

be

have
done
nothing

drink
some
innocent
whiskey

You

I
know
I
feel
funny
once
in
a
while
Dr
You
have
been
brought
here
and
allowed
to
temporarily
control
this
body
so
you
may
be
made
to
understand
that
you
must
leave

queer
I
am
not
so
correct
about
things
as
I
used
to
be

you
not
ask
the
reason

fact
is
you
have
lost
your

help
a
poor
fellow
when

so
dry

We
want

you

Why
did
you
give
me
that
hot
fire
Dr
I
was
giving
an
electrical
treatment
to
a
lady
not
to
you
The
lady
asked

drove

liked
that

You
deserved
it
Sp
Say
can

you
give
me
some
whiskey
Dr
You
are
only
wasting
time
What
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
make
you
understand
your
condition
You
are
an
invisible
spirit
controlling
the
body
of
this
woman
Sp
What
s
the
matter
with
that
other
woman
Why
do
I
always
have
to
go
with
her
Dr
You
have
been
obsessing
her
You
are
selfish
and
have
been
controlling
and
influencing
her
It
is
not
the
woman
s
fault
it
is
your
own
fault
Did
you
ever
read
the
Bible
Sp
The
Bible
Dr
Do
you
remember
how
Jesus
cast
out
unclean
spirits
You
are
such
a
spirit
Sp
Looking
at
hands
These
rings
do
not
belong
to
me
and
yet
how
in
the
devil
could
they
belong
to
any
one
else
Dr
Do
you
recognize
these
hands
Sp
No
I
must
have
had
a
little
too
much
But
I
don
t
seem
so
very
tipsy
I
guess
I
have
had
a
little
too
much
probably
You
can
hypnotize
people
in
many
ways
maybe
that
s
it
Or
probably
I
ve
had
too
little
and
you
had
better
give
me
more
whiskey
so
I
can
see
just
a
few
drops
I
am
blind
Give
me
something
and
be
a
good
fellow
Give
me
just
one
glass
more

You
will
have

You
can

drive
me
out

pretty
strong
you

I
could
fight
all

have
done
it
before

Rolling
up
sleeves

You

Can

No
You

Attempting

Give
me
something

Aren

Why
should

be
ashamed
All
I
had

Why

wait
a
minute

ran

What
for

whiskey

is
always
ready

will
not
happen
any
more

I
am
not
alone
there
are
many
others
with
me
Dr
Did
they
all
want
to
drink
Sp
Yes
Dr
You
were
ruining
a
woman

life
You
drank
through
that
woman
You
controlled
her
and
she
drank
for
you

Do
you
mean
that
big
fat
woman
Say
she

good
hearted

always
ready
to
treat
me
We
have
very
good
times
together
glorious
times

Dr
You
have
had
your
last
good
time
Do
you
think
you
are
doing
something
honorable
when
you
upset
a
woman
s
life
and
make
a
drunkard
of
her

I
m
no
drunkard
I
can
walk
just
as
straight

fast
as
any
one
I
have
sense
We
both
have
a
good
drink
together
Dr
There
is
no
sense
of
shame
in
you
Try
to
realize
that
you
are
an
invisible
spirit
and
have
lost
your
own
body
It
is
now
Do
you
know
that

Los
Angeles
California
You
lost
your
body
probably
many
years
ago

have
been
hovering
around

earth
sphere
ever
since

I
want
something
to
drink
right
now

you
call
a
glorious
time

were
ruining

life

I
haven
t
done
that

When
you
wanted
whiskey
you
made
that
lady
drink
it
for
you
Sp
I
did
not
I
drank
it
myself
Dr
Yes
through
the
lady
Don
t
act
so
innocent
You
impressed
the
woman
to
get
whiskey
for
you
Sp
Well
she
has
the
money
I
don
t
make
any
money
any
more
Dr
Is
it
right
to
influence
that
woman
just
to
satisfy
yourself
Did
your
mother
teach
you
such
things
Sp
My
mother
died
long
ago
Dr
Suppose
your
mother
were
alive
would
you
like
to
see
her
a
slave
to
an
earthbound
spirit
Sp
I
am
not
an
earthbound
spirit
Dr
Would
you
like
to
see
your
mother
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
earthbound
spirits
who
were
making
her
drink
Would
that
make
you
happy
Sp
She
wouldn
t
do
it
This
woman
is
good
enough
for
me
She
only
buys
whiskey
Dr
Yes
and
you
drink
it
through
her
Sp
I
drink
it
myself
Dr
By
controlling
the
lady
Mrs
V
just
as
you
are
now
controlling
the
body
of
this
lady
Sp
I
am
not
controlling
any
one
I
ve
only

a
drink
Dr
Try
to
be
sensible
This
body
is
not
yours
Sp
Whose

it
then
Dr
It
belongs
to
my
wife
She
is
a
psychic
sensitive
through
whom
spirits
can
talk
Sp
Will
she
have
a
drink
with
me
Will
you
Dr
No
Sp
I
ll
treat
the
crowd
Dr
I
thought
you
had
no
money
Sp
I
always
get
some
money
from
the
lady
Dr
She
is
not
here
Sp
You
get
it
and
I
ll
treat
the
crowd
Come

me
everybody
I

you
all
Dr
Does
the
lady
pay
the
bills
with
money
that
you
earn
SP
She
s
splendid
There
s
another
man
helps
her
to
pay
for
things
Dr
That
is
her
husband
SP
Husband
Dr
Yes
husband
You
are
making
a
slave
of
the
woman
and
making
a
drunkard
of
her
Suppose
it
were
your
mother
who
was
being
tormented
Sp
My
mother
Dr
Yes
think
that
over
carefully
Suppose
somebody
should
make
a
drunkard
of
your
mother
how
would
you
feel
Or
of
your
sister
Sp
They
know
better
Dr
Is
your
conduct
honorable
Sp
I
m
a
good
fellow
and
I
always
want
to
be
on
the
best
side
of
the
women
Women
are
always
my
best
friends
They
always
have
money
and
are
willing
to
spend
it
Dr
Now
listen
to
me
You
have
actually
lost
your
physical
body
probably
many
years
ago
Who
is
the
President
Sp
I
don
t
know
I
can
t
recall
any
one
Dr
Is
Lincoln
the
President
Sp
No
that
was
a
long
time
ago
Dr
Cleveland
Sp
No
Dr
McKinley
Arthur
Sp
He
was
President
a
long
time
ago
Dr
Do
you
remember
Wilson
Sp
Wilson
I
don
t
know
that
fellow
Dr
Do
you
know
about
the
big
war
in
Europe
with
twenty
three
nations
fighting
Sp
I
don
t
care
all
I
want
is
a
drink
I
am
getting
so
thirsty
What
do
I
care
for
war
If
they
want
to
kill
themselves
what
do
I
care
They
are
better
off
If
they
don
t
know
any
better
than
to
kill
each
other
let
them
go
ahead
Dr
What
did
your
mother
call
you
Sp
She
called
me
Paul
Dr
What
was
your
surname
Sp
It
is
a
long
time
since
I
heard
it
Dr
What
did
they
call
your
father
Sp
They
called
him
John
Hopkins
Dr
Then
you
must
be
Paul
Hopkins
What
state
were
you
born
in
Sp
I
have
forgotten
Of
yes
I
was
born
in
Yuma
Arizona
Dr
Were
you
ever
in
Los
Angeles
Sp
Yes
once
in
a
while
They
used
to
have
pretty
good
saloons
on
Main
Street
and
I
suppose
they
are
there
now
Dr
No
they
are
all
gone
Sp
Then
I
don
t
know
what
became
of
them
Dr
They
have
all
been
done
away
with
Sp
They
were
on
Main
Street
between
Second
and
Third
Dr
What
would
your
mother
think
of
your
condition
Sp
My
mother
is
dead
Dr
Her
spirit
did
not
die
She
would
be
sorry
to
find
you
in
this
condition
Sp
I
m
in
an
all
right
condition
I
feel
tip
top
I
get
a
glass
of
whiskey
when
I
want
it
and
it
makes
me
feel
good
and
happy
Dr
Does
it
make
you
happy
to
see
a
man
lying
drunk
in
the
gutter
Sp
I
have
never
seen
it
But
liquor
is
good
Oh
ho
Who
is
that
Seeing
some
spirit
Dr
Who
is
it
Sp
I
will
have
to
sit
up
and
take
notice
She
s
a
nice
lady
To
spirit
Who
are
you
Dr
Perhaps
it
is
you
own
mother
Sp
She
was
an
old
lady
This
lady
says
she
knew
my
mother
My
mother
was
a
good
Christian
woman
I
suppose
she
is
with
God
in
Heaven
sitting
near
the
throne
Dr
Jesus
taught
that
God
is
Spirit
and
God
is
Love
You
cannot
find
such
a
God
sitting
on
a
throne
Sp
Where
does
He
sit
Dr
God
is
Spirit
and
is
not
in
any
particular
place
He
is
the
Life
of
all
Nature
You
are
an
expression
of
God
himself
Understand
that
you
are
an
ignorant
spirit
and
must
overcome
your
old
habits
and
that
you
will
then
progress
Sp
This
lady
says
if
I
behave
myself
I
can
go
to
bed
and
rest
I
m
awfully
tired
I
am
a
pretty
tired
fellow
Will
they
let
me
rest
myself
Dr
Yes
and
when
you
wake
you
will
realize
that
you
are
a
spirit
and
that
you
must
overcome
old
habits
and
progress
as
you
should
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
Sp
That
lady
is
a
nurse
Dr
We
cannot
see
her
as
you
do
We
do
not
see
you
You
are
controlling
my
wife
s
body
SP
I
do
not
understand
that
I
want
to
go
to
that
bed
Dr
You
must
learn
the
purpose
of
life
SP
They
say
if
I
lie
down
in
that
bed
I
will
not
get
any
more
whiskey
Dr
You
will
be
taught
how
to
progress
Sp
Can
I
have
any
more
whiskey
Dr
No
Sp
Well
I
don
t
care
I
m
tired
and
I
feel
happy
What
can
a
fellow
do
I
have
no
home
and
no
place
to
go
You
must
have
a
good
time
sometimes
a
jollification
time
Dr
You
did
not
understand
your
condition
Sp
This
lady
says
I
will
have
a
home
with
my
mother
I
will
go
to
my
mother
Will
she
like
me
Dr
Mother
love
never
dies
After
you
acquire
understanding
you
must
help
this
lady
whom
you
have
been
tormenting
You
have
made
that
poor
lady
a
drunkard
Sp
Have
I
I
didn
t
know
that
I
wanted
something
to
drink
but
I
did
not
know
I
was
doing
any
harm
Dr
When
she
came
here
tonight
she
was
drunk
and
I
gave
her
a
treatment
Sp
I
had
that
Dr
You
made
her
drunk
she
herself
does
not
want
to
drink
She
tries
to
resist
the
impulse
She
is
a
sensitive
and
you
hypnotized
her
and
made
her
drink
Sp
It
s
pretty
hard
for
a
fellow
to
give
it
up
Dr
You
will
have
to
do
your
duty
and
help
her
Sp
I
feel
pretty
tired
I
want
to
go
to
that
bed
Dr
Think
yourself
in
that
bed
and
you
will
be
there
Sp
I
will
By
thinking
Dr
Yes
be
perfectly
quiet
and
think
yourself
in
that
bed
Sp
Remember
me
I
am
a
good
fellow
and
I
like
you
anyhow
even
if
you
gave
me
that
fire
I
mean
well
Dr
The
lady
whom
you
see
will
be
your
nurse
and
will
look
after
you
Sp
My
mother
is
here
Oh
mother
my
dear
will
you
forgive
me
I
was
not
a
good
fellow
I
will
not
drink
any
more
whiskey
Mother
says
she
will
help
me
God
bless
you
for
the
work
you
have
done
for
me
After
the
foregoing
experience
a
friend
reported
a
marked
change
for
the
better
in
Mrs
V
saying
that
no
further
desire
for
intoxicants
was
manifested
Mrs
V
herself
acknowledged
this
change
and
expressed
her
gratitude
for
the
relief
obtained
Not
at
all
uncommon
are
the
cases
of
amnesia
when
total
lapse
of
memory
occurs
all
sense
of
identity
is
lost
and
the
victim
wanders
to
strange
places
returning
to
his
normal
self
without
any
knowledge
of
his
recent
actions
We
have
abundant
demonstration
that
this
state
is
frequently
due
to
the
influence
of
obsessing
spirits
One
case
was
that
of
a
young
man
C
B
who
shortly
after
he
had
established
himself
in
business
with
his
father
rose
early
one
morning
and
left
his
home
without
the
knowledge
of
his
parents
No
trace
of
him
could
be
found
and
after
several
weeks
of
anxiety
the
parents
asked
us
to
concentrate
for
their
missing
son
We
did
so
emphasizing
that
the
young
man
should
have
no
rest
until
he
would
write
to
his
parents
The
following
morning
he
wrote
to
them
saying
he
was
on
board
a
United
States
Man
of
War
at
San
Francisco
that
he
had
enlisted
in
the
Navy
and
would
be
gone
for
several
years
The
boy
s
parents
were
anxious
to
have
him
at
home
with
them
and
wrote
him
to
that
effect
saying
they
would
do
all
they
could
to
obtain
his
release
The
day
before
our
next
concentration
circle
C
wrote
his
parents
that
they
should
do
nothing
regarding
his
discharge
for
he
was
entirely
willing
to
serve
his
term
of
enlistment
The
following
evening
we
again
concentrated
for
C
B
and
a
spirit
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
as
related
in
the
succeeding
article
clearly
giving
indication
of
having
been
the
cause
of
the
young
man
s
recent
actions

MRS
WICKLAND
While
singing
Throw
out
the
Life
Line
an
amusing
episode
occurred
As
the
intelligence
assumed
control
of
Mrs
Wickland
he
seemed
to
be
pulling
himself
along
hand
over
hand
as
if
by
a
rope
and
then
made
the
motions
of
swimming
Doctor
Did
you
hold
on
to
the
life
line
Have
you
been
drifting
about
Where
did
you
come
from
You
do
not
need
to
swim
on
dry
land
What
is
the
matter
with
you
Spirit
I
want
to
find
out
what
s
the
matter
with
me
Dr
How
long
have
you
been
dead
Sp
To
audience
He
calls
me
dead
I
am
not
dead
but
not
so
much
alive
either
Dr
Where
did
you
come
from
Sp
Lots
of
people
brought
me
here
Dr
Who
brought
you
Sp
A
whole
lot
of
people
Dr
I
don
t
see
them
Sp
I
don
t
see
why
they
want
me
I
want
to
be
out
at
sea
Dr
Have
you
been
out
before
Sp
Yes
Dr
Why
do
you
want
to
go
out
to
sea
Have
you
been
out
many
times
Sp
Quite
a
little
Dr
Don
t
you
want
to
be
on
shore
Sp
I
don
t
want
to
be
a
dry
crab
I
was
all
ready
to
go
out
but
you
pulled
me
to
shore
I
don
t
see
why
they
should
pull
me
to
shore
Dr
Were
you
drowned
at
sea
Sp
If
I
had
been
how
could
I
be
here
Dr
Your
spirit
could
be
here
Sp
You
mean
the
soul
Dr
Yes
Sp
Then
that
should
be
with
God
Dr
Where
is
God
Sp
If
you
don
t
know
that
then
you
ought
to
go
to
Sunday
School
Dr
I
did
go
but
I
did
not
find
out
there
Sp
Then
you
did
not
go
to
the
right
one
Dr
Which
one
should
I
have
gone
to
Sp
There
are
all
kinds
of
denominations
they
are
not
all
alike
but
they
all
know
about
God
Dr
What
church
did
you
go
to
Sp
The
church
where
I
go
is
where
I
can
be
all
alone
I
do
not
go
there
very
often
I
can
belong
to
any
denomination
When
you
are
on
the
water
you
can
t
go
to
church
you
go
to
service
Dr
Which
church
did
you
like
best
Sp
They
are
all
alike
It
s
just
a
matter
of
form
They
all
belong
to
one
God
and
teach
a
hereafter
a
Heaven
and
a
hell
and
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
So
you
see
I
feel
like
this
you
can
just
as
well
belong
to
one
as
another
They
all
praise
God
so
it
makes
no
difference
Dr
You
were
a
liberal
man
Sp
I
don
t
know
that
I
was
that
either
I
don
t
know
what
kind
of
a
man
I
was
I
had
my
own
religion
in
a
way
I
had

once

What
ship

Dr
How
old
were
you
Sp
I
can

seem

remember
Dr
And
now
you
want
to
go
to
sea
again
Sp
Yes
I
don
t
want
to
be
on
land
because
I
don
t
feel
I
belong
there
There
is
something
in
life
when
you
are
on
the
ocean
something
to
it
You
have
regular
meals
and
no
worry
if
your
work
is
done
all
right
Dr
Is
there
much
work
to
do
Sp
Oh
yes
lots
of
scrubbing
there
is
always
something
to
do
The
Captain
does
not
want
his
men
to
be
idle
If
we
were
left
alone
we
would
have
a
good
time
If
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
we
have
to
polish
all
the
time
I
know
something
about
it
We
have
to
polish
the
stairways
the
machinery
and
the
fixings
around

all
have
to
be
polished
Every

Were

No

I
was
there
but
not

was
outside
cruising
around
Some
had
to
be
on
guard
and
watch
If
we
had
all
gone
in
we
would
have
been
trapped
There
were
others

so
funny
I
think
I
had
some
kind
of
a
vertigo
spell
I
felt
funny
It
seemed
like
my
head
was
swimming
Dr
Were
you
painting
the
boat
Sp
We
were
cleaning
and
fixing
it
up
Dr
Were
you
in
dry
dock
Sp
I
cannot
remember
what
it
was
Something
happened
so
I
got
in
the
water
Dr
You
probably
dropped
off
the
scaffold
Sp
I
don
t
know
but
I
got
well
right
away
Dr
It
is
very
likely
that
you
lost
your
body
at
that
time
and
became
a
spirit
Sp
A
spirit
What
do
you
mean
Dr
I
mean
you
lost
your
mortal
body
You
are
invisible
to
us
Sp
But
I
was
going
to
sea
I
felt
as
if
a
part
of
me
was
a
sailor
but
I
also
felt
that
I
was
teaching
some
sailor
Through
obsessing
C
B
I
could
smell
the
salt
air
around
him
Sailors
have
a
kind
of
atmosphere
around
them
you
can
tell
them
when
you
see
them
I
wanted
to
go
back
again
You
feel
funny
when
you
are
on
land
You
feel
you
do
not
belong
there
The
land
is
so
solid
you
do
not
feel
right
I
feel
the
ocean
is
the
bosom
of
a
mother
you
are
rocked
to
sleep
You
feel
so
fine
when
the
waves
rock
you
to
sleep
Dr
When
you
fell
from
the
boat
you
probably
lost
your
body
and
you
have
been
a
spirit
since
then
This
is
not
your
body
Look
at
these
hands
Sp
Noticing
hands
of
psychic
That
is
not
my
hand
Laughing
No
I
should
say
not
I
had
big
big
hands
That
hand
has
not
pulled
any
ropes
That
s
funny
I
have
a
hand
like
that
Laughing
with
amusement
Dr
And
you
have
a
dress
and
long
hair
Are
those
the
feet
of
a
sailor
Sp
They
are
not
mine
Oh
I
see
One
time
a
long
time
ago
you
know
we
used
to
go
to
one
town
then
another
I
was
not
on
the
battleship
all
the
time
You
know
my
father
was
a
sea
Captain
and
of
course
we
were
on
water
all
the
time
He
sailed
from
New
York
to
India
and
around
there
Dr
On
a
sailing
vessel
Sp
Yes
He
had
a
sailing
vessel
first
when
I
was
just
a
little
kid
Then
he
had
a
vessel
He
went
between
Calcutta
New
York
and
England
Dr
With
a
merchant
vessel
Sp
Yes
He
had
a
lot
of
stuff
Then
he
went
to
Australia
one
time
he
dealt
in
cotton
and
wool
When
I
grew
up
I
felt
I
wanted
to
be
in
the
employ
of
the
Government
so
I
joined
the
Navy
to
my
father
s
disgust
He
did
not
like
it
but
he
said
I
was
a
sailor
born
I
think
I
was
born
on
the
water
I
do
not
know
the
land
My
mother
taught
me
to
read
and
write
and
that
was
all
the
schooling
I
had
We
were
always
on
the
water
Mother
was
a
pretty
good
woman
Dr
Did
your
mother
die
Sp
My
mother
is
not
living
and
my
father
is
dead
too
They
both
died
some
years
ago
But
this
was
not
what
I
was
going
to
talk
about
Dr
You
were
talking
about
these
hands
and
this
dress
Sp
I
do
not
see
how
I
could
get
a
woman
s
hands
and
dress
That
was
what
I
was
going
to
talk
about
when
I
drifted
away
I
do
not
know
but
I
should
judge
I
was
about
eighteen
or
nineteen
when
we
were
in
Calcutta
I
like
to
go
around
and
see
everything
and
I
like
to
talk
I
drifted
into
a
meeting
one
time
In
India
Calcutta
is
a
pretty
good
town
and
has
a
nice
climate
I
drifted
into
this
meeting
and
I
got
a
whole
lot
of
books
They
called
this
meeting
Theosophy
They
were
nice
people
but
queer
When
they
talk
before
you
know
it
you
believe
in
reincarnation
Is
this
skirt
reincarnation
You
said
I
am
dead
so
now
how
can
you
explain
it
in
any
other
way
That
must
explain
it
because
I
am
back
as
a
woman
Dr
You
might
call
this
reincarnation
in
a
way
When
you
pass
out
you
leave
your
mortal
body
and
become
a
spirit
Sp
You
know
they
go
to
Devachan
and
that
is
a
long
way
off
Say
Madam
Blavatsky
was
a
great
speaker
I
heard
her
in
Calcutta
Then
there
was
Leadbeater
I
was
only
a
kid
but
you
know
when
you
get
something
in
your
head
when
you
are
a
kid
it
stays
there
My
father
said
John
don
t
you
believe
that
you
will
go
crazy
I
said
It
is
better
than
nothing
it
tells
good
things
That
salvation
scheme
is
not
right
My
heart
felt
so
big
when
I
said
that
It
swelled
up
when
I
got
those
books
It
may
be
that
I
am
back
again
as
a
woman
I
didn
t
think
I
would
be
a
woman
I
wanted
to
be
a
sailor
again
Dr
You
are
using
a
woman
s
body
only
temporarily
Sp
So
I
am
a
woman
temporarily
Laughing
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
and
probably
have
been
since
It
is
now
You
have
been
out
of
your
body
ten
years
Sp
How
do
you
know
I
died
then
Dr
You
say
that
is
the
last
date
you
remember
Sp
Do
you
go
by
that
Then
I
have
been
in
Devachan
Maybe
sailors
don
t
stay
in
Devachan
so
long
maybe
their
vibrations
are
better
I
know
the
vibrations
are
much
more
vibrating
on
a
steamboat
especially
when
there
are
storms
Laughing
Really
and
truly
have
I
reincarnated
Dr
It
is
likely
that
you
passed
out
of
your
body
at
the
time
you
spoke
of
and
you
have
been
a
spirit
but
were
not
aware
of
your
condition
Sp
So
I
do
not
know
anything
Dr
Whatever
your
condition
has
been
you
have
been
brought
here
tonight
to
acquire
understanding
We
are
investigators
of
psychic
phenomena
and
spirit
obsession
Sometimes
spirits
take
control
of
mortals
and
cause
them
to
do
strange
things
You
have
been
attracted
here
and
are
controlling
this
body
which
belongs
to
my
wife
You
are
using
it
temporarily
We
do
not
see
you
we
only
hear
you
talk
Sp
Then
in
reality
I
am
in
a
woman
I
am
only
fooling
you
then
Dr
My
wife
is
so
constituted
that
spirits
can
use
her
body
temporarily
Have
you
ever
heard
of
mediums
Sp
Yes
I
have
been
to
mediums
to
have
my
fortune
told
You
know
they
are
only
controlled
by
Indians
Dr
Indians
are
excellent
gate
keepers
They
are
good
protectors
for
mediums
Sp
Why
did
I
come
here
Dr
For
understanding
You
have
evidently
been
doing
mischief
unconsciously
You
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
I
know
I
was
in
San
Francisco
once
I
have
not
been
there
for
a
long
time
It
was
in
Dr
You
probably
made
a
young
man
leave
his
home
and
parents
without
any
provocation
at
all
and
made
him
enlist
as
a
sailor
in
the
Navy
Sp
He
had
no
business
to
do
that
Dr
He
is
interested
in
other
work
He
seemed
to
lose
himself
and
enlisted
in
the
Navy
He
is
San
Francisco
now
There
is
evidence
in
his
case
that
some
spirit
has
been
interfering
with
him
and
I
surmise
that
you
are
the
one
Sp
For
goodness
sake
I
wouldn
t
do
that
I
woke
up
one
morning
and
I
felt
I
was
on
land
for
some
reason
or
other
and
I
wanted
to
be
on
water
Dr
You
were
drifting
about
and
came
in
contact
with
this
young
man
who
is
sensitive
to
spirit
influence
He
had
been
studying
too
hard
and
so
made
himself
sensitive
You
got
into
his
magnetic
aura
acted
through
him
and
caused
him
to
do
things
he
did
not
want
to
do
Did
you
enlist
very
recently
to
go
out
to
sea
again
Sp
It
seems
I
woke
up
early
one
morning
and
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
water
I
felt
I
was
lost
Dr
Didn
t
you
realize
that
you
did
not
have
full
control
of
yourself
Sp
I
felt
queer
In
a
way
I
was
in
a
dreamy
state
Say
I
didn
t
mean
to
do
anything
wrong
Dr
We
understand
your
position
and
know
you
are
a
good
fellow
We
don
t
blame
you
Sp
Who
is
that
boy
Dr
His
name
is
B
he
is
a
young
boy
of
seventeen
Sp
He
claimed
he
was
twenty
one
or
he
could
not
have
joined
Dr
He
is
large
and
looks
older
than
he
is
We
concentrated
for
him
and
I
suppose
we
pulled
you
to
shore
Sp
I
felt
some
one
pull
me
and
then
I
felt
I
was
in
the
water
I
recall
we
were
in
New
York
or
somewhere
around
there
and
it
was
awfully
stormy
and
icy
I
was
doing
something
and
fell
in
the
water
There
was
ice
all
around
me
We
had
been
there
for
a
while
but
I
do
not
know
any
more
How
did
I
get
into
that
boy
Dr
You
drifted
into
his
aura
Sp
Why
here
comes
my
mother
I
haven
t
seen
her
for
a
long
time
She
died
in
New
York
She
says
Oh
John
I
have
been
hunting
for
you
for
so
long
I
didn
t
know
it
If
I
am
dead
why
didn
t
I
go
to
her
Dr
Many
fall
into
a
sleep
and
remain
in
that
condition
for
some
time
Sp
Oh
I
was
in
Devachan
That
is
where
I
was
sleeping
to
reincarnate
Dr
Now
you
must
go
with
your
mother
She
will
take
you
to
her
home
Sp
I
will
go
to
my
mother
and
father
my
old
father
Dr
Does
he
have
understanding
now
Sp
Mother
says
Yes
but
she
had
a
time
with
him
He
wanted
to
see
the
Savior
I
never
quite
believed
in
that
story
I
wanted
to
find
out
about
it
but
never
did
I
think
Theosophy
is
the
best
because
they
do
not
have
that
blood
question
to
deal
with
I
don
t
believe
in
one
person
being
killed
for
others
If
I
did
anything
wrong
why
should
I
not
suffer
myself
God
is
Love
and
He
never
wanted
any
one
killed
to
save
another
Such
damned
foolish
things
The
church
people
are
so
down
on
Jews
and
yet
Jesus
was
a
Jew
Dr
Now
you
must
go
with
your
father
and
mother
Sp
I
ve
been
in
a
nice
crowd
This
has
been
a
good
night
I
feel
pretty
good
It
has
been
a
good
night
to
speak
with
nice
people
and
spend
a
couple
of
hours
having
a
good
time
You
say
you
cannot
see
these
others
here
but
there
are
quite
a
few
Now
mother
says
my
dear
little
mother
she
says
I
must
go
She
has
not
seen
her
son
for
a
long
time
We
have
lots
to
talk
about
together
I
told
you
my
mother
was
good
I
must
say
goodbye
to
you
all
Trying
to
rise
but
unable
to
do
so
Why
what
s
the
matter
with
my
legs
I
cannot
stand
on
them
Dr
You
are
only
controlling
the
upper
part
of
the
body
Sp
Then
I
m
only
half
a
man
Laughing
heartily
Worse
and
worse
Only
half
woman
half
sailor
Now
I
must
go
with
my
dear
little
mother
Dr
You
must
learn
to
think
Sp
Think
Have
I
not
been
thinking
before
Laughing
Excuse
me
but
everything
seems
a
joke
Dr
That
s
all
right
You
will
have
to
travel
by
thinking
Sp
Not
by
my
legs
Will
I
not
need
my
legs
any
more
I
haven
t
any
you
know
I
m
only
half
a
man
Dr
Just
think
yourself
with
your
mother
and
you
will
be
there
Sp
Think
myself
with
my
mother
and
I
will
be
there
I
am
going
now
But
you
folks
are
so
jolly
that
I
think
I
ll
come
again
some
day
You
don
t
mind
if
I
come
do
you
By
the
way
will
you
please
tell
that
boy
I
feel
sorry
if
I
did
him
mischief
Dr
Will
you
try
to
help
him
You
can
Sp
I
can
How
Dr
By
impressing
him
to
return
home
Your
mother
will
explain
to
you
Sp
My
mother
says
I
should
thank
you
for
finding
me
But
she
found
her
son
in
a
woman
She
did
not
recognize
me
in
a
woman
but
we
have
to
take
things
as
they
come
Now
I
will
go
Good
Night
The
day
after
this
the
attitude
of
C
B
changed
entirely
He
then
wrote
to
his
parents
urging
them
to
do
everything
possible
to
secure
his
release
as
he
wanted
to
come
home
and
continue
his
work
He
added
that
he
could
not
understand
why
he
had
enlisted
and
that
he
seemed
to
have
been
in
a
daze
Since
the
young
man
had
enlisted
as
being
of
age
while
in
reality
only
seventeen
he
was
after
many
difficulties
and
delays
released
from
service
and
he
returned
to
his
home
once
more
his
normal
self
CHAPTER

Psychic
Invalidism
SPIRITS
who
are
ignorant
of
having
lost
their
physical
bodies
often
hold
firmly
in
mind
the
thought
of
their
former
physical
condition
and
continue
to
suffer
pain
This
error
of
the
mortal
mind
persists
until
an
understanding
of
transition
and
spiritual
laws
is
reached
when
freedom
from
ideas
of
physical
limitations
is
attained
When
spirits
who
are
under
this
delusion
of
suffering
and
disease
come
into
the
auras
of
mortals
their
condition
is
conveyed
to
the
sensitives
and
chronic
lassitude
pseudo
illness
and
psychic
invalidism
result
These
sensitives
endure
all
the
pain
of
the
spirits
former
physical
condition
and
ordinary
methods
of
treatment
fail
to
cure
for
the
only
permanent
relief
is
found
through
the
dislodgement
of
the
ignorant
entities
While
we
were
in
Chicago
a
friend
of
ours
Miss
F
W
a
companion
to
Mrs
McA
prominent
modiste
in
the
city
asked
us
to
concentrate
for
Mrs
McA
who
was
a
chronic
invalid
The
latter
had
been
ordered
by
her
physicians
to
take
a
rest
cure
and
could
not
be
induced
to
get
up
again
She
was
suffering
intense
pains
in
the
head
and
was
subject
to
many
changeable
moods
Miss
F

and
Mrs

masseuse
were
present
during
the
following
occurrence

Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
The
spirit
at
first
spoke
with
great
difficulty
complained
of
being
very
sick
and
was
unable
to
sit
up
She
insisted
that
she
was
too
sick
to
be
up
and
wished
to
go
to
bed
When
asked
whether
she
knew
any
one
in
the
room
she
at
once
recognized
Mrs
McA
s
masseuse
and
demanded
that
she
take
her
to
bed
inimediately
wait
upon
her
and
draw
down
the
shades
as
the
light
was
too
strong
for
a
sick
person

Mrs
McA
She
gave
her
name
as
Grace
Brusted
of
Boston
said
she
was
a
Universalist
and
that
the
year
was
She
had
been
sick
for
a
long
time
and
felt
as
if
she
were
two
persons
at
times
herself
and
at
other
times
another
person
She
was
often
called
Mrs
McA
but
was
tired
of
answering
to
that
name
as
she
did
not
like
Mrs
McA
Recently
she
had
had
to
do
entirely
too
much
work
having
had
to
give
orders
to
the
sewing
girls
futhermore
Miss
F
W
would
have
to
do
things
in
her
way
or
be
discharged
The
spirit
repeated
again
that
she
was
tired
of
living
a
double
life
that
she
could
not
understand
it
and
was
more
than
ready
to
die
The
way
of
progression
was
then
explained
and
the
spirit
s
grandmother
and
mother
appeared
to
her
saying
that
she
had
always
been
a
spoiled
child
but
would
now
have
to
learn
to
serve
others
Miss
F
W
and
the
masseuse
said
that
Mrs
McA
had
been
acting
in
the
same
manner
as
this
spirit
even
using
the
identical
language
and
they
later
reported
that
on
the
following
morning
Mrs
MCA
was
in
a
very
genial
mood
remarking
that
it
was
the
first
time
for
many
months
that
she
had
wakened
without
a
headache
After
this
she
improved
rapidly
left
her
bed
and
resumed
her
usual
activities
For
over
a
period
of
six
years
a
friend
of
ours
an
elderly
gentleman
eighty
four
years
old
was
afflicted
with
unaccountable
pains
in
the
back
of
the
neck
and
a
peculiar
dizziness
and
vertigo
which
came
upon
him
with
increasing
frequency
When
seized
with
these
attacks
he
felt
that
walls
and
buildings
would
fall
and
crush
him
an
extreme
nausea
accompanied
these
sensations
and
if
seated
he
would
fall
forward
with
his
head
below
his
knees
and
for
some
time
would
be
unable
to
straighten
himself
without
help
Unable
to
find
any
physical
cause
for
his
distress
the
possibility
of
spirit
interference
was
suggested
and
we
concentrated
for
him
at
our
psychic
circle
A
spirit
then
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
and
fell
forward
with
head
between
the
knees
We
labored
with
the
entity
for
some
time
until
he
was
finally
able
to
tell
us
that
his
name
was
Jack
Finch
that
he
was
about
sixty
five
years
old
and
had
been
an
inmate
of
an
institution
near
Madison
Wisconsin
He
said
that
when
he
was
quite
small
some
one
probably
his
sister
had
been
carrying
him
and
had
dropped
him
to
the
floor
and
that
this
fall
had
broken
his
back
and
left
him
helpless
As
he
grew
older
he
became
a
great
care
his
mother
neglected
him
and
he
was
finally
placed
in
an
institution
He
remembered
he
had
been
in
a
cyclone
at
one
time
and
that
something
had
struck
him
on
the
back
of
the
neck
adding
still
further
to
his
misery
He
had
always
been
in
great
pain
and
his
broken
back
and
injured
neck
produced
dizzy
spells
which
would
cause
him
to
double
over
and
remain
in
a
cramped
position
until
aid
was
given
When
this
dizziness
came
upon
him
he
would
feel
as
if
he
were
sliding
off
a
roof
or
as
if
the
walls
were
crushing
him
again
he
often
felt
as
if
the
bed
would
fall
on
him
and
as
if
everything
were
spinning
around
He
said
that
because
of
his
helpless
condition
no
one
had
ever
cared
for
him
with
the
single
exception
of
a
nurse
by
the
name
of
Anasteena
who
had
been
very
kind
to
him
at
the
institution
and
had
always
fed
him
But
everything
is
changed
now
Sometimes
I
feel
like
a
small
man
and
sometimes
like
a
woman
or
like
a
big
man
Sensations
experienced
when
influencing
different
mortals
When
the
spirit
was
brought
to
a
realization
that
he
had
lost
his
mortal
body
and
could
no
longer
have
any
physical
pain
he
asked
If
I
have
lost
my
body
and
if
I
am
dead
then
why
haven
t
I
seen
God
Where
is
He
This
led
to
an
explanation
of
the
true
nature
of
God
His
manifestation
in
all
things
and
the
existence
of
the
spirit
world
Being
told
to
look
about
to
see
whether
some
one
was
present
whom
he
had
known
on
earth
he
said
Why
there
is
my
mother
She
wants
me
to
go
with
her
to
her
home
she
says
she
will
take
care
of
me
now
She
says
I
never
knew
what
real
life
was
on
account
of
my
crippled
body
but
that
I
will
commence
to
really
live
from
now
on
While
speaking
he
saw
in
the
distance
another
spirit
coming
toward
him
and
he
exclaimed
with
great
joy
It
is
Anasteena
Can
I
go
with
her
too
Assured
that
he
could
go
with
his
mother
and
friend
that
he
would
be
well
cared
for
and
would
begin
a
life
of
happiness
he
said
fervently
God
bless
you
and
was
then
taken
away
The
next
day
the
friend
who
had
suffered
from
the
vertigo
attacks
found
himself
free
from
the
ailment
and
said
he
had
so
much
surplus
energy
that
he
felt
he
must
be
forty
eight
instead
of
eighty
four
Nor
was
he
ever
subject
to
any
recurrence
of
his
former
trouble
Mr
Z
from
the
neighboring
town
of
Burbank
who
had
suffered
for
twenty
five
years
from
sleeplessness
and
an
intense
nausea
without
having
been
able
to
obtain
relief
was
brought
to
us
by
a
physician
who
suspected
obsession
in
the
case
During
the
consultation
Mrs
Wickland
saw
the
spirit
of
a
man
standing
behind
the
patient
and
when
she
described
this
spirit
the
patient
recognized
an
old
friend
who
had
passed
out
a
number
of
years
before
After
an
electrical
treatment
had
been
given
to
the
patient
this
spirit
left
him
and
taking
control
of
Mrs
Wickland
spoke
to
his
friend
recalling
incidents
of
their
former
acquaintanceship
Mr
Z
had
at
one
time
been
engaged
to
the
daughter
of
this
spirit
but
for
religious
reasons
the
engagement
had
been
broken
The
two
men
had
however
continued
friendly
relations
and
when
the
father
found
himself
in
financial
straits
Mr
Z
had
aided
him
in
a
business
way
When
the
father
later
died
of
cancer
of
the
stomach
he
was
attracted
to
Mr
Z
because
of
his
regard
for
him
becoming
enclosed
in
his
aura
he
was
unable
to
free
himself
and
had
remained
with
him
for
twenty
five
years
conveying
to
his
mortal
friend
the
symptoms
of
the
disease
from
which
he
had
suffered
while
in
earth
life
After
receiving
an
explanation
of
the
laws
of
the
higher
life
he
left
repentantly
and
Mr
Z
was
no
longer
troubled
with
the
nausa
condition
An
unusual
type
of
psychic
invalidism
due
to
spirit
influence
was
the
case
of
Mrs
G
who
had
for
many
years
suffered
in
tensely
from
a
peculiar
spinal
affliction
which
baffled
all
skill
of
physicians
After
Mrs
G
had
been
under
our
care
for
some
time
a
spirit
who
had
died
of
a
broken
back
and
neck
was
removed
and
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
The
guiding
intelligences
explained
that
he
had
drifted
into
the
aura
of
the
patient
when
she
was
a
child
and
had
become
enmeshed
in
her
nervous
system
thus
transferring
to
his
victim
the
physical
condition
under
which
he
had
died
and
which
he
still
believed
himself
to
be
suffering
from
With
the
removal
of
the
spirit
the
patient
was
promptly
relieved
and
suffered
no
more
pain
in
the
back

The

seemed
to
be

toward
the
shoulder
At
first
unable
to
speak
he
pointed
to

and
moaned
continually

in
great
pain
At
these
indications
both
Mr

What
does
your
mother
say
Sp
She
says
Oh
Jimmie
where
have
you
been
She
has
been
looking
for
me
but
could
not
find
me
Dr
That
is
because
you
have
been
with
that
lady
making
a
great
deal
of
trouble
Now
you
can
go
with
your
mother
Sp
It
s
a
long
time
since
I
saw
my
mother
Dr
It
is
now
Sp
No
Dr
It
is
the
fourth
of
July
and
you
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
No
it
must
be
Dr
That
was
thirty
years
ago
Sp
But
I
was
living
in
after
the
accident
I
was
crippled
for
years
The
last
I
remember
it
was
Dr
That
was
twenty
seven
year
ago
Sp
How
can
all
those
years
be
gone
Have
I
been
sleeping
Dr
Only
partially
You
have
been
bothering
people
Sp
I
have
been
kept
shut
up
for
years
and
years
In
aura
of
patient
I
thought
I
was
going
to
die
once
but
after
I
had
been
shut
up
for
a
while
I
felt
different
I
had
lady
s
clothes
on
and
I
felt
like
a
woman
but
my
neck
bothered
me
so
and
my
head
was
like
it
came
off
my
spine
Dr
You
got
into
that
lady
s
magnetic
aura
and
bothered
her
When
you
lost
your
body
you
still
had
the
idea
that
your
neck
was
broken
but
your
body
went
to
the
grave
Sp
But
I
had
a
neck
that
always
hurt
Dr
You
held
the
idea
in
your
mind
that
you
still
had
a
broken
neck
As
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
Your
mind
was
on
your
broken
neck
and
you
did
not
realize
that
a
change
had
occurred
This
body
which
belongs
to
my
wife
has
no
broken
neck
Sp
Your
wife
Where
is
she
Dr
Sleeping
Look
at
your
feet
they
are
not
really
yours
Sp
Am
I
a
woman
Dr
Only
temporarily
Now
you
must
go
with
your
mother
Sp
Mother
will
you
take
me
with
you
Dr
What
does
she
say
Sp
She
says
yes
but
I
must
ask
that
lady
to
forgive
me
But
I
could
not
help
it
I
could
not
get
out
I
was
shut
up
such
a
long
time
and
I
m
tired
Now
I
will
go
with
my
mother
Oh
Mother
come
and
take
me
I
will
be
a
good
boy
Dr
Now
you
will
find
understanding
Sp
I
feel
I
am
dying
My
head
is
off
again
Dr
That
is
only
a
temporary
sensation
When
you
leave
you
may
feel
as
if
you
were
dying
but
that
is
only
because
you
are
losing
control
You
could
not
die
if
you
tried
Nobody
ever
really
dies
Spirit
never
dies
Sp
Will
I
have
a
better
body
Dr
Yes
Now
forget
your
broken
neck
and
your
pain
Sp
I
am
going
with
my
mother
Please
forgive
me
lady
Mrs

That
s
all
right

Goodbye
Sp
Goodbye
In
the
summer
of
a
gentleman
Mr
I
consulted
us
about
his
wife
who
for
nine
months
had
been
confined
to
her
bed
suffering
from
intense
pain
in
the
head
diagnosed
by
others
as
due
to
brain
tumor
and
from
a
seemingly
paralyzed
condition
of
one
arm
which
was
helpless
We
made
several
calls
at
the
home
of
the
invalid
giving
electrical
treatments
which
strengthened
the
patient
but
Mrs
Wickland
clairvoyantly
saw
the
spirit
of
a
man
with
a
ghastly
head
wound
and
a
woman
with
a
crippled
arm
hovering
about
At
our
next
concentration
circle
the
spirit
of
this
man
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
and
we
learned
that
in
life
he
had
been
a
house
painter
who
had
fallen
from
a
scaffold
and
as
he
said
split
open
his
head
He
did
not
know
that
he
had
died
and
declared
that
he
was
suffering
from
agonizing
pains
in
the
head
but
that
lately
he
had
a
very
comfortable
bed
to
rest
in
Convinced
of
his
true
condition
he
was
taken
away
and
from
that
time
Mrs
I
had
no
further
pain
in
the
head
She
still
remained
in
bed
however
feeling
weak
and
suffer
ing
with
the
paralyzed
arm
After
another
treatment
we
re
turned
to
our
home
inviting
Mr
I
to
attend
our
concentration
circle
that
evening
When
he
came
he
said
that
after
our
departure
his
wife
felt
so
much
better
that
she
had
risen
and
for
the
first
time
in
nine
months
spent
the
day
out
of
bed
The
events
of
the
evening
therefore
were
of
great
interest
to
the
gentleman
as
the
controlling
spirit
complained
of
pains
corresponding
exactly
with
those
endured
by
his
wife

To

some

I
go
sometimes

I
get

up

ask

It

strange

This
is
the
first
time
somebody
talked
to

I
came
here
when
you
were
singing
about
that
beautiful
shore
I
thought
I
wanted
to
go
on
that
other
shore
and
I
was
just
looking
to
see
where
it
was
Dr
We
will
help
you
reach
that
shore
Sp
Before
I
knew
it
I
could
talk
when
you
talked
to
me
Controlled
psychic
This
is
what
I
have
to
say
nobody
talked
directly
to
me
for
a
long
long
time
If
I
talked
to
any
one
someone
else
always
answered
I
never
seemed
to
have
anything
to
say
No
one
paid
any
attention
to
what
I
said
That
is
the
funniest
thing
of
all
That
is
funny
I
got
out
of
the
home
that
I
was
working
in
because
they
were
awfully
mean
to
me
Dr
What
did
they
do
Whip
you
Sp
Not
exactly
I
was
working
in
a
family
somewhere
I
was
so
hungry
and
of
course
I
did
not
do
things
as
well
as
they
wanted
me
to
There
came
a
lady
and
she
said
she
would
take
me
away
from
the
Home
I
wished
she
had
not
In
the
Home
it
was
pretty
fair
Of
course
we
had
hard
times
but
it
is
better
than
to
be
scolded
all
the
time
In
the
Home
we
had
lots
of
things
we
did
not
like
but
we
had
a
good
time
too
This
woman
took
me
and
the
first
thing
she
said
was
that
I
should
have
to
read
the
Bible
from
morning
to
night
I
got
sick
and
tired
of
the
Bible
Then
I
had
to
pray
My
knees
were
so
sore
I
could
hardly
walk
on
them
I
had
to
be
on
my
knees
all
the
time
reading
and
praying
She
said
I
should
walk
with
my
knees
not
my
feet
She
tried
to
save
me
She
said
I
had
never
been
a
real
good
girl
and
if
I
did
not
do
as
she
said
I
should
go
to
some
very
hot
place
In
the
Home
we
prayed
and
the
Mother
was
awful
nice
We
prayed
and
believed
in
God
When
that
woman
took
me
I
was
fourteen
That
was
my
sorry
day
I
had
to
work
and
work
and
earn
something
and
she
scolded
me
as
she
said
I
did
not
do
as
she
wanted
me
to
It
was
praying
and
reading
all
the
time
There
was
nothing
to
it
I
didn
t
pray
I
had
to
get
down
on
my
knees
but
I
did
not
get
in
my
mind
what
she
was
saying
because
my
knees
hurt
me
She
got
awful
mad
when
I
slipped
down
and
she
pulled
my
hair
She
had
a
cushion
under
her
knees
She
could
stay
there
for
hours
She
said
I
was
a
sinner
because
I
got
tired
Are
you
a
sinner
when
you
can
t
stay
on
your
knees
a
long
time
I
did
not
know
very
much
but
I
thought
many
times
really
and
truly
don
t
tell
anyone
whispering
confidentially
but
I
thought
God
would
be
awfully
tired
to
hear
that
all
the
time
I
was
so
tired
that
I
went
to
sleep
Then
she
pulled
my
hair
and
slapped
me
She
prayed
to
God
but
she
acted
so
bad
She
said
if
I
was
not
good
the
devil
would
get
hold
of
me
I
thought
sometimes
really
and
truly
that
she
was
one
If
I
got
on
my
knees
and
went
to
sleep
she
came
to
me
and
she
prayed
God
help
me
out
of
this
misery
You
know
oh
God
how
I
love
you
She
prayed
for
herself
first
and
then
for
her
sister
her
mother
and
her
brother
and
father
and
her
friends
and
at
last
she
prayed
for
Minnie
They
did
not
know
my
other
name
I
do
not
know
who
my
really
and
truly
father
and
mother
were
I
never
knew
I
never
got
my
history
but
they
said
they
found
me
on
the
step
They
often
called
me
Minnie
On
The
Step
I
got
so
mad
at
them
They
found
me
on
the
step
they
said
They
gave
me
the
name
of
Minnie

one

a
long
time
either
I
ran
away

the
lady
was
so
mean
I
was
running
away
from
her
Then
I
had
so
little
to
eat
I
ran
away

I
got
so
hungry
I
had
no
money
Dr
What
happened
after
that
Sp
I
got
far
far
off

I
lost
my
way
I
was
so
hungry
that
I
went
to
sleep
It
came
so
dark
and
I
was
in
the
woods
I
had
to
run
in
the
woods
so
that
she
would
not
find
me
I
walked
and
walked
and
I
thought
I
would
find
some
one
to
give
me
something
to
eat
To
the
first
house
I
did
not
go
I
went
away
hungry
and
I
walked
a
whole
day
and
night
and
it
seems
there
was
nothing
but
big
trees
and
forest
Then
I
went
to
sleep
and
I
don
t
know
any
more
that
day
Passed
out
Next
day
I
felt
better

I
walked
again

I
got
to
the
city

walked
ever
and
ever
so
far
and
saw
lots
of
people
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
me
I
got
hungry
so
I
saw
a
woman
go
into
a
restaurant

we
had
some
dinner
She
was
eating
it
all
I
got
a
little
She
did
not
talk
to
me
Then
I
went
out
again

I
kept
on
walking

after
a
while

saw
some
one
else
go
into
a
restaurant
some
other
people
We
ate
but
they
paid
for
it

No

mortal

were
trying

hunger

person
You
probably
lost
your
body

the
woods

I
was
so
thirsty
The
food

did
not
miss
so
much

I
thought

was
drying
up

throat

thought

could
drink
a
barrel

I

this
little

Goodbye
A
week
after
the
interview
with
Lily
another
homeless
spirit
wanderer
came
to
the
circle
a
quaint
investigative
philosopher
who
had
been
drawn
into
the
aura
of
Mrs
G
the
mother
of
R
G
This
spirit
was
an
orphan
who
had
known
Mrs
G
in
childhood
she
had
at
that
time
developed
a
strong
affection
for
her
and
this
love
had
attracted
the
spirit
to
Mrs
G
although
she
had
not
recognized
in
the
grown
woman
the
friend
of
her
childhood

Doctor
Why
don
t
you
join
in
the
singing
Spirit
I
never
saw
these
people
before
so
why
should
I
join
in
the
singing
Dr
Where
did
you
come
from
Sp
I
don
t
know
Dr
We
should
like
to
know
more
about
you
Isn
t
it
strange
that
you
should
be
here
Sp
I
don
t
know
anything
about
it
I
shall
have
to
find
out
Dr
Tell
us
who
you
are
and
what
your
name
is
Sp
Somebody
said
if
I
came
here
I
would
find
a
home
Dr
You
certainly
will
Sp
I
have
not
had
a
home
for
a
long
time
Dr
What
have
you
been
doing
Sp
Walking
around
everywhere
and
sleeping
where
I
could
put
my
head
Dr
Are
you
a
girl
a
man
a
woman
or
a
boy
Sp
Don
t
you
know
I
am
a

Dr
How
old
are
you
Sp
Probably
but
I
m
not
sure
but
I
think
I
am
sixteen
or
seventeen
Dr
Where
were
you
staying
Sp
I
don
t
know
Dr
Try
to
think
perhaps
you
can
remember
Sp
I
have
been
to
so
many
places
I
should
like
to
have
a
home
Dr
Have
you
no
father
and
mother
Sp
No
Dr
Where
did
you
stay
when
you
were
little
Sp
I
always
stayed
in
a
big
place
where
there
were
many
children
We
were
all
together
We
used
to
fight
and
carry
on
all
the
time
I
don
t
think
I
ever
had
a
mother
I
think
I
was
born
in
that
big
place
I
was
there
as
long
as
I
can
remember
anything
It
was
a
big
place
with
lots
of
boys
and
girls
Some
were
good
and
some
bad
all
kinds
I
did
everything
I
could
do
I
did
what
they
told
me
to
do
and
they
kept
me
doing
things
all
the
time
I
kept
on
working
like
machinery
They
said
Now
Ella
you
go
there
and
Ella
you
go
there
and
after
a
little
while
it
was
Ella
everywhere
I
had
to
fix
so
many
little
boys
and
girls
that
I
think
I
was
a
mother
to
them
all
Dr
Were
they
fond
of
you
Sp
They
all
came
around
me
and
I
had
to
do
things
for
them
That
was
my
work
and
I
helped
them
all
I
could
And
it
wasn
t
always
easy
to
bathe
and
dress
a
dozen
little
children
They
were
very
noisy
so
I
said
for
them
to
keep
quiet
I
got
mad
sometimes
You
know
I
tried
to
do
my
very
best
but
when
they
stepped
on
my
toes
I
got
mad
Dr
How
long
ago
was
that
Sp
I
don
t
think
it
s
so
long
ago
You
know
I
lost
my
way
I
went
out
walking
one
time
and
I
couldn
t
find
my
way
back
Dr
What
happened
after
that
Sp
Nothing
has
happened
I
have
been
walking
to
find
that
Home
again
Dr
Did
you
have
an
accident
Sp
No
but
I
shall
have
to
keep
on
walking
until
I
find
that
Home
Dr
Do
you
want
to
understand
why
you
have
been
walking
and
have
no
home
Sp
Somebody
said
if
I
came
here
I
would
have
a
home
and
they
pushed
me
in
and
before
I
knew
anything
I
was
sitting
here
and
you
were
singing
I
was
crying
and
a
girl
said
you
had
helped
her
and
if
I
came
here
I
would
get
happy
When
I
walked
it
was
half
dark
and
half
light
I
have
been
trying
to
find
a
home
When
I
was
with
those
children
I
had
to
work
hard
but
it
s
better
to
have
them
than
to
have
nothing
to
do
I
would
rather
have
my
children
Dr
Were
they
orphans
like
yourself
Sp
They
thought
I
was
not
right
in
my
mind
but
I
was
as
good
as
any
of
them
Dr
You
are
talking
to
us
but
we
cannot
see
you
I
can
see
my
wife
but
not
you
Sp
Your
wife
For
land
s
sake
alive
Laughing
heartily
You
know
I
always
like
to
laugh
and
when
all
the
children
began
to
cry
I
started
to
laugh
and
I
laughed
and
laughed
until
I
got
them
still
That
was
the
only
way
I
knew
to
get
them
all
still
when
they
were
crying
Then
they
got
good
natured
again
If
you
laugh
hard
when
somebody
cries
they
will
stop
crying
and
begin
to
laugh
Sometimes
they
called
me
Laughing
Ella
Dr
Where
did
you
get
this
ring
Sp
I
never
had
a
ring
before
Greatly
pleased
and
laughing
again
Dr
This
is
not
your
hand
and
this
is
not
your
body
Sp
What
are
you
talking
about
Laughing
Dr
It
may
seem
foolish
to
you
but
it
is
the
truth
Have
you
ever
heard
that
He
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
Ask
these
people
whose
body
this
is
Sp
To
audience
Is
this
my
body
Ans
No
it
is
not
Sp
Yes
it
is
Dr
This
body
belongs
to
Mrs
Wickland
Sp
Mrs
Wickland
Laughing
Dr
You
are
laughing
at
your
own
ignorance
You
are
temporarily
controlling
Mrs
Wickland
s
body
Sp
I
never
heard
such
funny
talk
Dr
What
I
am
telling
you
is
not
so
foolish
as
it
sounds
You
lost
your
physical
body
Probably
you
were
sick
You
have
awakened
to
a
new
condition
of
life
Sp
How
could
I
waken
if
I
had
no
body
Dr
You
have
a
spirit
body
Sp
When
you
say
I
have
lost
my
body
do
you
mean
I
am
dead
Dr
To
the
world
yes
The
world
is
ignorant
of
the
facts
When
a
person
loses
his
physical
body
people
say
he
is
dead
That
is
wrong
The
spirit
has
only
left
the
body
The
spirit
is
the
real
person
the
body
is
merely
the
house
Nobody
dies
it
only
seems
so
Sp
Yes
they
do
I
have
seen
dead
people
I
knew
a
little
girl
that
died
and
she
went
to
Heaven
Dr
You
have
only
seen
dead
bodies
You
can
only
stay
here
a
short
time
then
you
will
have
to
leave
Sp
Where
will
I
go
Dr
To
the
spirit
world
Sp
Say
I
am
a
real
lady
I
have
a
necklace
round
my
neck
Dr
That
belongs
to
my
wife
You
are
an
invisible
spirit
and
have
been
wandering
in
outer
darkness
If
you
want
a
home
you
can
have
one
Sp
Do
you
mean
Heaven
Dr
Jesus
said
The
Kingdom
of
God
is
within
you
Sp
Jesus
died
for
our
sins
and
if
we
are
good
when
we
die
we
will
go
to
Heaven
and
be
with
the
angels
We
prayed
all
the
time
in
the
Home
Seeing
little
R
G
sitting
beside
her
mother
I
like
that
little
girl
over
there
I
have
seen
her
before
Mrs
G
Do
you
know
Lily
She
is
a
spirit
who
was
here
last
week
Sp
To
R
G
You
were
very
naughty
the
other
day
when
we
had
company
What
made
you
so
naughty
Mrs
G
That
other
girl
Lily
made
her
behave
badly
Sp
That
other
girl
was
awfully
mean
I
felt
like
spanking
her
When
she
came
near
that
little
girl
R
G
changed
faces
Dr
She
was
a
spirit
and
was
influencing
this
little
girl
You
are
also
a
spirit
and
are
talking
through
my
wife
s
body
In
just
that
way
the
spirit
of
that
girl
acted
through
this
child
Sp
Somebody
told
me
to
come
in
here
and
I
would
find
a
home
and
that
I
had
a
mission
to
do
What
does
that
mean
Dr
Probably
you
can
protect
this
litle
girl
Sp
They
say
I
am
going
to
be
a
watcher
that
I
must
see
that
nobody
gets
hold
of
her
I
don
t
know
what
they
mean
Dr
That
will
all
be
explained
to
you
Listen
to
a
little
Indian
girl
whom
you
will
find
here
She
will
take
you
to
a
home
Sp
Will
they
like
me
In
that
big
Home
all
the
children
liked
me
because
I
made
them
laugh
They
say
I
must
stay
around
this
little
girl
and
protect
her
from
influences
Dr
That
means
spirit
influences
Sp
I
am
going
to
look
into
that
business
Dr
You
will
need
to
have
understanding
first
Do
you
see
others
here
Sp
I
see
many
girls
jumping
around
and
feeling
happy
There
is
a
nice
lady
here
and
she
says
her
name
is
Pretty
Girl
She
s
awfully
pretty
There
s
a
young
girl
and
she
says
I
can
come
with
her
She
says
she
brought
me
here
They
say
I
always
tried
to
do
everything
I
could
to
help
now
they
are
going
to
take
care
of
me
Sometimes
when
I
got
a
whipping
I
thought
Well
maybe
I
needed
it
I
cried
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
I
went
into
my
little
corner
and
said
Now
Ella
you
were
naughty
and
you
needed
that
spanking
I
thought
about
it
for
a
while
then
I
began
to
laugh
and
I
never
felt
the
spanking
at
all
When
you
feel
good
inside
from
laughing
you
can
t
feel
things
on
the
outside
You
just
try
it
Dr
Now
you
must
go
with
these
friends
Sp
They
say
when
I
get
understanding
I
am
going
to
be
a
little
helper
To
R
G
Don
t
forget
when
you
feel
naughty
just
laugh
and
then
you
won
t
be
naughty
When
I
get
to
be
nurse
girl
for
that
little
girl
I
won
t
let
anyone
in
I
will
see
that
they
stay
out
I
will
show
you
Dr
Where
did
you
live
Sp
In
Kansas
Mrs
G
had
formerly
lived
in
Kansas
I
had
to
dress
ten
or
twelve
of
the
children
and
wash
them
and
put
them
to
bed
Some
went
to
school
and
some
went
to
play

Assistant
Matron
in
charge
of
girls
Sp
She
was
in
another
room
There
were
some
naughty
girls
in
M
s
room
Sometimes
even
the
Matron
could
not
control
some
of
the
girls
even
when
she
spanked
them
so
I
had
to
go
to
them
You
know
spanking
isn
t
good
all
the
time
When
the
Matron
spanked
the
little
ones
and
they
cried
I
would
go
to
them
after
she
had
gone
and
make
them
laugh
A
good
laugh
always
made
them
forget
the
spanking
Mrs
G
Do
you
remember
seeing
me
when
I
was
a
little
girl

Staring
then
excited
Yes
Why
yes
I
remember

But
you
were
not

all
the
time
Mrs

came
to
the
orphanage
occasionally
as
a
visitor
You
used
to
come
and
then
go
away
You
always
had
such
pretty
hair
and
you
used
to
have
such
pretty
dresses
Do
you
remember
you
had
a
parasol
and
walked
around
like
a
big
lady
Mrs

Do
you
remember
the
time
I
fell
into
the
water
Sp
Oh
my
yes
and
everybody
was
so
excited
and
you
got
wringing
wet
and
your
Grandmother
scolded
you
I
took
a
liking
to
you
The
time
you
went
into
the
water
I
felt
so
sorry
for
you
You
spoiled
your
nice
dress
That
was
a
long
long
time
ago
Now
I
remember
lots
of
things
My
eyes
seem
to
open
I
took
an
awful
cold
and
I
got
sore
throat

then
I
remember
I
went
to

I
always
liked

CHAPTER
XI
Materialism
and
Indifference
THE
binding
influence
of
skepticism
of
mental
apathy
and
unconcern
regarding
the
higher
life
is
so
powerful
after
transition
that
many
are
held
in
a
condition
of
helpless
despair
darkness
bewilderment
and
rebellion
often
clinging
to
mortals
as
their
only
means
of
expression
Some
years
ago
a
friend
of
ours
Mrs
F
W
was
living
in
New
York
very
happily
married
and
leading
an
active
normal
life
She
had
an
understanding
of
the
higher
laws
of
life
but
her
husband
although
devoted
to
her
maintained
the
viewpoint
of
a
materialist
and
fatalist
Believing
in
no
form
of
religion
Mr
F
W
was
convinced
that
death
ended
all
and
had
often
declared
that
if
his
wife
should
pass
away
he
would
commit
suicide
and
frequently
urged
her
to
promise
that
if
he
passed
away
first
she
would
take
her
life
but
to
this
she
would
not
consent
After
a
brief
illness
this
gentleman
suddenly
passed
away
but
his
wife
could
still
see
him
very
distinctly
especially
at
night
when
he
repeatedly
awakened
her
frightening
her
so
that
she
could
not
sleep
Unconscious
of
his
true
condition
he
still
sensed
that
some
thing
strange
had
occurred
and
wishing
to
remove
the
barrier
which
separated
him
from
his
wife
he
constantly
urged
her
to
come
to
him
calling
insistently
Kill
yourself
you
must
come
to
me
I
want
you
and
I
will
finally
get
you
so
kill
yourself
now
The
continual
cry
of
Kill
yourself
was
with
Mrs
F
W
day
and
night
until
she
feared
for
her
own
safety
Anxious
to
prevent
any
rash
act
on
her
part
she
left
New
York
and
came
to
us
in
Chicago
for
assistance
During
an
interview
the
spirit
of
F
W
was
allowed
to
control
Mrs
Wickland
and
when
he
found
himself
sitting
beside
his
wife
he
grasped
her
hand
kissed
her
wedding
ring
and
asked
if
she
were
angry
with
him
since
she
would
not
answer
him
when
he
spoke
to
her
Then
seizing
her
in
his
arms
he
kissed
her
frantically
and
crushed
her
in
so
powerful
an
embrace
that
she
could
not
free
herself
and
called
for
aid
I
explained
to
the
spirit
that
he
was
controlling
a
body
not
his
own
and
that
he
had
passed
out
of
the
physical
life
When
he
at
last
realized
the
situation
his
regret
for
having
unintentionally
annoyed
his
wife
was
profound
and
he
was
eager
to
learn
the
higher
laws
in
order
to
understand
how
he
might
help
her
Mrs
F
W
then
returned
to
New
York
and
experienced
no

F
W
became
a
loyal
member
of
the
Mercy
Band
and
in
several
of
many
communications
since
received
from

he
related
the
bewilderment
of
one
suddenly
finding
himself
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
without
understanding

WICKLAND
Well
here
I
am
again
I
want
to
come
in
to
tell
you
that
I
have
not
gone
I
have
to
speak
through
this
instrument
but
otherwise
I
am
here
to
help
you
all
do
the
good
work
you
are
doing
and
you
know
I
am
always
here
ready
to
do
what
I
can
to
help
you
and
also
to
help
all
who
are
in
trouble
I
want
to
thank
you
for
having
helped
me
otherwise
my
wife
and
I
would
be
in
trouble
and
through
my
own
fault
I
would
not
listen
to
the
great
wonders
of
the
life
beyond
When
I
was
in
my
parents
home
my
parents
were
so
orthodox
so
strong
in
their
belief
that
they
condemned
every
one
who
did
not
believe
as
they
did
and
they
hypnotized
themselves
with
the
idea
that
nothing
was
right
except
what
they
thought
I
could
not
live
in
that
atmosphere
and
I
left
home
I
was
only
a
boy
when
I
left
home
and
why
did
I
go
Because
the
atmosphere
was
so
strongly
orthodox
that
it
drove
me
away
I
could
not
believe
as
my
parents
did
and
they
said
if
I
did
not
I
was
a
sinner
I
was
not
a
sinner
and
I
could
not
believe
as
they
did
so
I
ran
away
from
home
I
am
not
sorry
that
I
left
for
I
learned
to
know
something
of
the
outside
world
I
had
my
troubles
but
I
learned
from
them
I
learned
the
condition
outside
of
the
church
and
I
learned
how
to
battle
for
myself
but
I
was
bitter
and
so
hard
toward
churches
that
I
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
any
religion
I
had
heard
so
much
of
it
through
childhood
and
had
seen
too
much
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
churches
I
do
not
mean
that
all
churches
are
alike
but
you
will
find
that
when
there
is
too
much
orthodoxy
the
people
are
hypnotized
and
feel
they
are
so
good
that
no
matter
what
they
do
whether
they
are
right
or
wrong
they
are
right
because
they
cannot
do
wrong
They
are
so
holy
that
even
the
wrong
they
do
is
considered
right
I
traveled
and
saw
the
world
but
I
had
a
great
longing
for
home
I
came
home
again
after
I
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
and
I
thought
I
would
remain
with
my
parents
But
the
same
conditions
were
still
there
I
wanted
to
stay
at
home
to
do
my
duty
and
work
but
I
could
not
I
felt
as
if
I
were
being
crushed
by
orthodoxy
so
I
went
away
again
I
traveled
still
further
and
I
had
new
experiences
I
opened
my
heart
and
tried
to
look
for
the
brighter
and
happier
side
of
life
Later
on
I
met
one
who
loved
me
one
who
made
a
home
for
me
That
was
the
first
time
I
felt
I
really
had
a
home
and
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
was
happy
We
had
only
a
few
short
years
of
happiness
together
on
earth
but
those
few
years
will
always
be
with
me
I
did
not
think
there
was
a
life
after
this
I
did
not
believe
in
anything
I
was
tired
of
orthodoxy
and
everything
else
I
thought
when
I
died
that
would
be
the
end
and
there
would
be
no
more
That
was
also
wrong
Do
not
let
us
go
to
one
side
of
the
road
or
the
other
but
let
us
stay
in
the
middle
and
investigate
everything
Find
the
truth
and
stay
in
that
narrow
path
the
path
of
reason
and
understanding
of
God
s
wonderful
manifestations
I
passed
to
the
other
side
of
life
with
the
thought
that
there
was
nothing
after
death
I
passed
on
very
suddenly
When
death
came
it
was
like
a
sleep
I
woke
up
and
saw
my
dear
little
wife
crying
she
was
very
sad
but
I
did
not
realize
that
the
change
had
taken
place
She
did
not
listen
to
what
I
said
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
I
called
to
her
and
asked
what
was
the
trouble
but
she
did
not
speak
to
me
I
wondered
what
was
the
matter
for
we
loved
each
other
dearly
I
began
to
grow
stronger
and
I
did
not
want
to
leave
her
I
came
in
direct
contact
with
her
and
felt
that
she
must
come
to
me
and
be
with
me
for
we
had
never
been
parted
I
was
attracted
to
her
through
her
sadness
and
I
felt
she
must
come
to
me
I
did
not
realize
the
change
and
I
knew
she
wanted
to
be
where
I
was
so
I
made
up
my
mind
that
she
was
coming
to
me
Before
I
knew
it
I
was
in
her
magnetic
aura
I
stayed
there
because
I
could
not
get
away
I
was
unhappy
she
was
unhappy
But
I
thank
God
she
had
an
understanding
of
the
life
hereafter
She
knew
the
condition
I
was
in
and
she
wanted
to
free
herself
from
the
influence
I
was
throwing
on
her
so
she
came
to
these
dear
people
Dr
W
s
I
was
helped
and
so
was
she
We
would
both
have
been
miserable
if
she
had
not
understood
for
I
did
not
know
about
the
life
after
this
and
I
did
not
care
I
want
to
give
a
warning
to
all
of
you
here
do
not
doubt
the
next
life
Some
day
you
will
all
have
to
go
the
same
way
Let
us
investigate
let
us
know
the
truth
before
we
pass
on
to
the
Great
Beyond
so
we
may
go
with
open
eyes
and
know
where
we
are
going
with
a
definite
knowledge
If
my
wife
had
not
had
understanding
I
would
have
made
her
take
her
own
life
then
where
would
we
have
been
There
are
many
passing
from
earth
life
who
are
in
a
similar
state
They
find
themselves
in
somebody
s
magnetic
aura
and
cannot
get
out
and
then
they
obsess
that
person
I
wanted
to
get
out
of
my
misery
but
I
did
not
know
how
and
the
only
way
I
could
think
of
was
that
my
wife
should
come
to
me
When
there
is
an
understanding
of
life
then
one
cannot
be
in
such
a
situation
as
I
was
when
I
passed
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
want
to
thank
you
all
for
helping
me
Since
I
have
been
helping
other
unfortunate
spirits
that
cannot
see
and
do
not
know
of
the
higher
life
I
am
happy
So
I
am
working
and
now
I
can
be
with
my
dear
wife
to
help
and
guide
her
Learn
all
you
can
of
the
wonderful
life
beyond
I
wish
every
one
of
you
here
would
do
your
part
to
spread
the
truth
that
there
is
a
life
after
this
and
that
we
must
find
it
If
we
do
not
learn
this
while
in
the
body
we
must
do
so
when
we
reach
the
other
side
Many
many
times
we
are
sorry
that
we
did
not
look
into
the
truth
before
we
passed
out
of
earth
life
I
want
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
two
young
girls
who
are
about
to
leave
here
One
had
been
a
patient
the
other
her
companion
When
you
leave
keep
in
your
hearts
what
you
have
learned
Remember
it
and
learn
more
because
you
will
have
to
protect
yourselves
Learn
all
you
can
Help
others
in
similar
trouble
and
you
will
help
yourself
and
gain
strength
Now
that
you
have
found
the
truth
do
not
put
your
light
under
a
bushel
Helping
others
will
strengthen
you
You
will
receive
strength
and
power
to
keep
well
and
you
will
not
then
be
obsessed
any
more
Each
and
every
one
should
be
proud
to
help
spread
the
truth
because
there
is
a
wave
of
obsession
going
on
everywhere
Let
us
all
do
our
part
and
do
our
work
while
we
are
here
gaining
all
the
knowledge
of
the
life
beyond
that
we
can

How
do
you
do
Don
t
you
know
me
I
think
you
should
This
is
F
W
The
time
must
come
when
there
will
be
circles
of
this
kind
in
every
little
society
every
church
Then
people
will
not
be
taken
to
the
insane
asylum
they
will
be
helped
Many
of
the
poor
afflicted
ones
who
are
in
the
asylums
are
controlled
by
spirits
and
should
be
helped
but
most
persons
think
they
are
not
worth
bothering
about
They
prefer
to
send
people
to
the
insane
asylum
and
let
them
stay
there
We
must
not
condemn
the
spirits
who
are
controlling
sensitives
because
they
were
not
taught
regarding
the
higher
life
while
in
the
physical
and
have
no
knowledge
of
it
Many
believe
that
after
death
they
will
go
straight
to
Heaven
and
will
see
God
on
a
throne
and
there
they
will
sit
and
sing
and
eat
figs
and
all
that
When
I
was
a
boy
my
father
and
mother
were
very
religious
My
father
professed
holiness
and
the
environment
was
such
that
I
felt
as
if
I
were
being
pulled
to
pieces
I
could
not
stand
the
atmosphere
at
home
My
father
and
mother
were
good
people
but
had
such
a
narrow
way
of
thinking
that
I
felt
I
was
in
a
cage
so
I
ran
away
when
I
was
only
a
child
I
had
many
struggles
and
many
hardships
but
I
thank
God
today
that
I
ran
away
I
learned
many
bitter
lessons
during
my
life
but
I
also
learned
not
to
be
a
mere
believer
and
when
I
reached
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
received
an
explanation
of
my
changed
condition
I
was
not
held
back
by
any
orthodox
religious
doctrine
When
I
was
on
earth
I
made
the
best
I
could
of
circumstances
but
when
it
came
to
religion
I
did
not
believe
in
anything
I
felt
that
death
was
all
and
there
was
nothing
more
I
would
not
and
could
not
believe
as
my
parents
did
I
felt
God
was
the
Life
of
all
things
not
an
angry
God
who
threatened
hell
and
damnation
as
the
churches
taught
I
felt
there
was
nothing
after
this
and
that
after
death
all
would
be
ended
I
made
up
my
mind
to
do
my
best
while
on
earth
I
went
to
church
sometimes
I
traveled
around
saw
the
world
and
gained
experience
which
is
worth
a
great
deal
to
me
now
After
I
was
married
my
wife
taught
me
a
little
about
the
other
side
of
life
a
more
cheerful
view
than
the
orthodox
one
still
I
did
not
believe
However
there
was
a
little
light
of
understanding
I
wanted
my
wife
to
promise
that
if
I
should
die
first
she
would
go
too
and
if
she
went
first
I
would
follow
but
she
would
not
make
that
promise
because
she
understood
more
of
the
next
life
than
I
did
The
time
came
when
I
had
to
leave
and
very
suddenly
I
seemed
to
go
into
a
pleasant
sleep
of
rest
and
I
woke
up
where
It
says
in
the
Bible
Where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
My
treasure
was
my
dear
little
wife
and
when
I
woke
up
I
found
myself
in
her
magnetic
aura
She
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
me
and
I
wondered
what
could
be
the
trouble
and
why
she
would
not
talk
to
me
when
I
spoke
to
her
I
felt
queer
and
I
did
not
know
where
I
was
Death
is
only
a
sleep
a
sleep
as
natural
as
that
which
you
have
every
night
on
earth
When
one
awakes
from
the
sleep
of
death
everything
is
so
natural
that
you
feel
you
are
still
with
your
relatives
Then
if
you
get
into
a
person
s
magnetic
aura
you
live
right
with
him
and
you
are
there
I
was
in
my
wife
s
aura
and
could
not
realize
why
I
should
have
to
go
wherever
she
went
and
not
be
an
independent
individual
as
I
used
to
be
and
it
annoyed
me
I
felt
desperate
I
felt
that
my
wife
must
come
with
me
I
did
not
know
where
but
I
wanted
her
My
love
for
her
was
so
strong
that
I
tormented
her
against
my
will
because
I
had
no
understanding
of
the
real
life
on
the
other
side
I
loved
my
wife
dearly
yet
I
disturbed
her
for
I
did
not
know
any
better
and
she
was
tormented
tormented
by
the
one
who
loved
and
idolized
her
But
she
came
to
these
kind
people
Dr
W
s
and
was
freed
and
I
thank
you
as
I
have
many
times
before
for
having
helped
us
both
I
had
to
learn
by
experience
When
we
know
about
the
other
side
we
are
happy
to
go
and
meet
friends
who
have
already
gone
over
It
is
very
necessary
for
every
one
to
know
the
truth
because
we
all
have
to
take
that
journey
I
know
now
that
God
is
Love
God
is
everywhere
Since
He
is
Love
and
Wisdom
He
knows
the
past
present
and
future
How
could
He
then
have
created
a
world
only
to
lose
control
of
it
For
if
He
later
found
the
people
full
of
sin
He
certainly
must
have
lost
control
of
His
creation
Yet
the
churches
teach
that
having
lost
control
of
the
world
God
created
a
person
for
the
particular
purpose
of
being
sacrificed
and
that
those
who
believe
this
will
win
a
golden
crown
Let
us
not
misconstrue
God
God
knows
everything
and
He
reveals
Himself
to
Himself
Everything
has
life
in
Nature
Where
can
you
go
without
Life
without
God
He
is
in
everything
Humanity
should
know
that
each
is
a
part
of
this
wonderful
life
Nothing
should
be
condemned
because
everything
in
Nature
is
perfect
Any
disturbances
in
Nature
are
only
for
development
As
soon
as
you
have
trouble
and
something
disturbs
you
you
begin
to
long
for
a
higher
life
you
want
to
attain
it
and
you
work
for
that
end
Life
goes
on
on
the
other
side
and
it
is
always
progressive
Teach
children
the
truth
Teach
the
higher
things
of
life
All
is
God
Now
I
must
go

Night

out
I
have
asked
many

they

they
do
not
know
They
cannot
inform
me

They

What

Doing
nothing

It

what

do
Dr
Acquire
understanding
Sp
How
can
you
find
it
Dr
You
cannot
find
understanding
you
have
to
develop
your
mind
You
are
controlling
a
woman

body

possibly
you
claim
to
be
a
man
Are
you
a
man

No

Isn

an
unfortunate

It

You
must

What
was
the
use
Dr
Did
you
try

understand
the
wonderful
facts

life
Sp
Life
No
Dr
I
suppose
you
only
believed
that
Christ
died

your
sins

that

a
lazy

job
That
is
not
enough

It

good

Why

Well

Dr
You

occupying
a
lady

now

I
ve
had
enough
of
ladies
I
have
been
walking

walking
between
ladies
until
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
them
Dr
I
think
you
were
born
with
that
tired
feeling
Sp
I
think
so
myself
because
I
am
always
tired
I
do
not
care
very
much
for
work
anyhow
It
was
just
as
well
not
to
work
I
was
born
to
be
traveling
around
because
I
was
never
satisfied
to
be
in
one
place
I
liked
to
see
the
world
I
did
not
want
to
do
very
much
except
what
came
along
just
enough
so
I
could
get
along
Dr
Were
you
a
sort
of
tramp
Sp
I
was
a
little
better
than
a
tramp

it
Mrs

Do
you
remember
that
you
had
a
twin
brother

Something

that

what
is
the
matter

me
anyhow
I
cannot
recall
anything
everything
is
gone
I
do
not
know
for
sure
what
is
my

Dr
Sit
quietly
and
think
Sp
After
a
moment
It
is
Bergquist
I
think
it
is
Frank
yes
it
is
Frank
I
heard
that
some
years
ago
It
s
an
awful
long
time
since
I
heard
it
It
seems
so
far
away
that
it
is
miles
and
miles
away
that
name
is
It
seems
like
I
was
walking
away
from
it
The
more
I
walked
the
more
I
forgot
After
a
while
I
walked
so
long
that
I
forgot
who
I
was
I
walked
with
women
women
women
until
I
thought
I
was
a
woman
myself

really
sometimes
I
thought
I
was
And
probably
I
am
a
woman
for
all
I
know

all
I
care
What
is
the
use

Mrs

Yes

In

You

California
Well

didn
t
walk

that
was
a
long
walk
I
know
I
haven

been
riding
I
have
walked
for
miles
and
miles
and
miles
At
last
I
got
to
California
That
was
some
walk
I
am
pretty
tired
Why
did
you
tell
me
I
walked
that
far
Because
that
makes
me
very
tired
and
now
I
feel
I
have
to
rest
Mrs
H
W
That
is
natural
for
you
Do
you
know

I
thought

looked

seen

face
before
Didn

Methodist
Church

didn

liked

you
could
only
look
at
those
girls
with
one
eye
Mrs
H

Somebody
looked
at
them
with
two
eyes
They
are
both
married
Sp
I
looked
at
them
with
a
quarter
of
an
eye
They
wouldn

look
at
a
fellow
like
me
Dr
Has
anybody
else
looked
at
you

I
don

Women
women

Dr
What
did
they
call
you
when
you
felt
that
you
were
a
woman
Sp
I
don
t
hear
anything
Of
course
I
have
had
a
long
walk
if
I
have
walked
to
California
Sometimes
I
got
chased
out
when
I
was
behind

I
ran
fast
as
I
could

sometimes
I
got
in
front
Dr
In
front
of
what
SP
The
people
Do
you
suppose
I
walked
that
long
distance
alone
I
was
walking
with
a
big
crowd
Spirits
obsessing
patient
At
times
I
was
before
and
then
I
was
behind
What
s
the
use
We
all
talked
the
same
thing
Dr
Where
did
you
get
food
when
you
were
out
walking
Sp
I
didn
t
seem
to
need
much
I
have
learned
to
fast
Dr
Didn
t
you
go
to
different
houses
and
ask
for
food
Sp
At
times
but
that
was
long
ago
Somebody
said
if
you
fast
three
or
four
days
you
would
not
feel
your
stomach
It
was
a
bother
to
feel
hungry
if
you
didn

have
anything
to
eat
I
fasted
pretty
good
and
it
was
a
good
thing

I
went

tell
them
that
Mrs

Why
don

you
want

Because
they
wouldn

Mother

like
me
to
go
there
Mrs
H

You
had
a
good
father

I
wanted

made
you

You
know
she
said
If

want

you
will
have
to
work
Say
that
isn

right
I
always
liked
to
slip
out
if
I
could
That

natural

No
it
is
not
It
may
be
to
some
but
not

Everybody
likes

idling
around
You
want

little
freedom
Mrs

You
wanted
all
freedom
you
wanted
to
just
loaf
around

I
worked
sometimes

gave
my
mother
money
at
times

it
was
not

had

You
liked
best
to
walk
from
door
to
door

beg
your
food
and
get
five
dollars

could

What
was
the
use

Dr
We
want
you
to
understand

have
passed
out

long
time

seems
to
know

made
good
biscuits

wished
sometimes
I
had
one
Mrs

Did
you
ever
have
any

my
doughnuts

Yes
sometimes
you
gave
me
some

was
supposed
to
look
for
work
but
some
way
or
other
I
did
not
work
and
I
didn
t
care
very
much
either
Dr
Now
then
understand
friend
that
you
are
so
called
dead
You
have
been
an
ignorant
spirit
for
a
long
time
in
the
outer
darkness
which
the
Bible
speaks
of
This
is
not
your
body
Sp
Yes
it
is
Dr
It
is
my
wife

Sp
How
could
I
be
your
wife
when
I
am
a
man
Dr
You
are
an
invisible
spirit
We
do
not
see
you
We
only
hear
you
talk
Do
you
recognize
these
hands
Indicating
hands
of
psychic
Sp
I
have
been
so
strange
for
a
long
time
What
in
the
world
is
it
It
has
been
so
strange
at
times
There
was
lightning
and
thunder
electricity
given
patient
and
it
bothered
me
terribly
I
have
not
been
left
alone
for
one
minute
It
was
fierce
that
thunder
and
lightning
The
lightning
is
the
worst
the
thunder
is
not
so
bad
The
lightning
is
so
bad
that
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
I
should
really
see
afterwards
I
should
say
it
was
coming
down
in
torrents
It
seemed
as
if
you
got
knocked
in
the
head
and
then
got
it
again
and
again
It
was
wonderful
how
you
got
it
It
was
a
wonder
for
it
woke
me
up
It
woke
me
up
good
and
plenty
at
times
so
that
I
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
Mrs
H
W
I
am
glad
of
it
Sp
I
don
t
see
why
you
should
be
glad
Mrs
H
W
I
will
tell
you
why
I
am
glad
You
have
been
bothering
my
daughter
for
a
long
time
Sp
How
do
you
know
I
have
Mrs
H
W
That
is
the
reason
you
were
with
women
all
the
time
You
are
ignorant
and
have
been
troubling
my
daughter
You
got
thunder
and
lightning
for
it
when
my
daughter
had
electric
treatments
and
you
got
out
I
am
glad
of
it
Dr
I
am
the
one
who
gave
the
electricity
to
you
We
chase
ignorant
spirits
away
with
it
Sp
I
think
you
had
better
be
a
little
milder
with
it
then
Dr
I
do
not
like
to
give
it
but
it
is
sometimes
necessary
Sp
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
need
to
have
so
much
of
it
coming
down
like
thunder
and
lightning
You
get
it
in
the
head
like
a
sledge
hammer
Dr
But
we
succeeded
in
driving
you
from
the
lady
Sp
I
didn
t
bother
any
lady
I
didn
t
have
a
chance
I
was
walking
behind
them
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
I
had
any
way
of
bothering
them
Mrs
H
W
You
surely
bothered
my
daughter
Dr
That
was
why
we
had
to
give
you
electricity
Were
there
any
others
with
you
Sp
There
are
many
with
us
Dr
Are
there
any
more
left
Sp
I
don
t
know
There
are
some

Have

No
I
never

Did

No

Mrs

Yes

Sp
I
told

I
never
bothered
your

I
walked
behind

women
Dr
You
walked
a
little
too
close
Were
you
the
only
man
among
so
many
women

There
is
something
like
what
you
would
call
a
line

you
have
to
walk
in
that
line

you
cannot
go
out

did

The

heavy
listlessness
Mrs

W
You
were
too
lazy
Sp
What
was
the
use
when
you
could
get
your
food
without
It
is
just
as
well
to
take
things
instead
of
working
yourself
to
death
Dr
That
is
a
poor
argument
People
who
accomplish
something
are
happy

I

fancy
it
If

want

they
are

You

very
long

I

You

yours
Wake

sleepy

How
did
I
get
it
I
have
been
with
women
so
much
that
I
have
a
woman

hands
Dr
You
must
wake
up
and
listen
The
fact
is
you
are
an
ignorant
spirit
You
have
been
taken
away
from
that
lady
you
have
been
bothering
her
for
a
long

You
lost
your

years

That

You
died

freed

you

I
have
had
to
give

electricity
to
get
rid
of
you
You
have
been
driven
away
from
her
and
allowed
to
control
my
wife

body
The
point
is
you
will
have
to
leave
this
body
and
become
sensible
Sp
I
want
to
ask
you
this
if
I
haven

you
do
Mother
used
to
say
I

no
sense
Dr
You

been
lazy

now
you
will
have
to
use
the
sense

God
gave
you

Ignorant

What

a
poor

Use

You

does
not
belong

Dr
Yes
and
you
must
leave
this

My

control
her
body
in

to
free
the
other

What
kind
of

Many
earthbound
spirits
are
conscious
of
influencing
mortals
but
enjoy
their
power
seeming
to
be
without
scruples
Often
these
have
during
earth
life
turned
away
from
orthodoxy
and
become
hardened
to
higher
ethics
and
ideals
A
spirit
of
this
type
was
dislodged
from
Mr
G
who
had
since
childhood
been
subject
to
violent
attacks
of
temper
During
the
weeks
when
this
spirit
was
being
brought
to
the
front
preparatory
to
removal
Mr
G
was
very
irritable
especially
when
driving
his
automobile
and
developed
moods
during
which
he
wished
to
be
away
from
every
one
After
the
spirit
was
dislodged
the
gentleman
s
characteristics
changed
completeIy
and
he
became
natural
again
Both
Mr
and
Mrs
G
were
present
at
the
time
this
spirit
controlled

The
best
thing
to
work
up
an
appetite
is
to
get
hungry
Then
you
eat
everything

it
tastes
good
If

Come

Life

You

Well

It

No

Sp
Johnnie

will
not
tell
you
what
it
is
Dr
Did
you
kill
any
one

is
that
why
you
are
so
full
of
hatred
Sp
No

an
honest

my

Closing

Dr
Why
are
you
sitting
so
quietly
Sp
Be
still
I
am
thinking
I
want
to
be
by
myself
Dr
What
evil
thoughts
have
you
in
your
mind
now
Sp
You
look
out
asking
me
such
questions
When
I
get
mad
I
could
knock
this
house
down

I
could
knock

Dr
Talk

You

Tell

Just

Dr
That

bombastic

You

I

will
suit
me
just
right
Dr

part
friends
Sp
You
say
friends
You
can
never
find
a
friend
in
me
when
you
give
me
electricity
like
you
did
Dr
Those
were
just
friendly
taps
That
was
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
you

Sarcastically
You

never
knew

Dr
You
are
talking
through
my

You
cannot

You

Be
free

A

You

If

Refusing

was
converted
once
by
a
rascal

a

He
took
all
of
my
money
and
then
kicked
me
out
Dr
Probably
that
was
a
good
thing
for
you
Sp
What
To
kick
me
out
I
just
asked
him
a
few
questions
about
life
and
he
said
You
big
sinner
get
out
of
here
All
he
wanted
was
money
Dr
But
that
didn

settle
the
question
of
life

The
question

Life

told

many
times

lost
your

a

and
yet
you
do
not
understand
it
Sp
I
have
not
lost
my

Mr

Mrs

When

Yes
I
have

I
don

No

whole
control

I
am
only
half

then
I
get
mad
Dr
You
are
hovering
around
people

using
their
bodies
You
are
not
really
dead
The

one
thing

the
body
another
You
have
lost
your
mortal
body

your
spiritual
body
looks
like
your
mortal
body
You
are
ignorant

your
condition

come
in
touch
with
mortals

control
them

wills
of
their
own

I

Mr

I

liked

have
a
good
time
The
other

studied

wanted
to
go
off
by
himself
I
think
he
was
going
to
study
for
a
minister

a
lawyer

always
had

book
with

What

the
matter

Mr

You

have
been
so
badly
hurt

you
passed

Possibly
you
thought

You
lost

Most
people
would
call

dead

not

Another

get
rid

look
out

mortal
body

You

That

Cleveland
was
President
the
second

You

called
dead

There

or

You
are
not
talking
through
your
own
body
now
Sp
I
m
not
Dr
No
you
are
speaking
through
my
wife
She
is
so
constituted
that
spirits
can
control
her
and
speak
through
her
and
we
are
having
these
investigating
circles
to
come
in
contact
with
spirits
like
yourself
Ignorant
spirits
often
influence
mortals
and
disturb
their
balance
You
conveyed
your
temper
to
this
gentleman
Mr
G
and
made
him
act
as
if
he
had
a
bad
temper
Sp
I
did
Mr
G
Did
you
ride
in
that
machine
Sp
Yes
but
I
hate
it
Dr
I
ll
tell
you
about
those
machines
About
they
began
to
invent
what
they
call
automobiles
these
machines
go
without
horses
for
they
run
by
their
own
power
We
have
millions
of
them
now
Sp
What
have
they
done
with
their
fine
horses
Dr
They
do
not
use
them
now
Automobiles
are
very
convenient
you
can
travel
one
hundred
miles
an
hour
but
the
average
is
twenty
or
twenty
five
miles
an
hour
Sp
I
wouldn
t
ride
in
one
that
goes
that
fast
Dr
You
can
travel
two
or
three
hundred
miles
a
day
These
machines
have
been
invented
since
you
lost
your
body
We
have
aeroplanes
now
that
fly
in
the
air
and
we
can
telegraph
without
any
wires
We
can
even
talk
across
the
ocean
without
any
wires
You
cannot
realize
what
wonderful
things
have
happened
since
you
passed
out
Do
you
know
that
you
are
in
California
now
Sp
I
feel
so
weak
Dr
Don
t
lose
control
friend
until
you
give
us
your
name
Sp
I
don
t
know
it
my
head
is
in
such
a
mess
Don
t
bother
me
and
I
will
tell
it
to
you
in
a
little
while
For
a
long
time
I
have
had
so
many
different
names
that
I
don
t
remember
my
name
at
all
Dr
Look
around
your
mother
may
be
here
Sp
I
heard
my
mother
call
me
one
time
Sometimes
I
am
Charlie
sometimes
Henry
sometimes
a
man
and
sometimes
a
woman
so
I
don
t
know
what

It
s
so
long
since
I
heard
my

Fred

Ask
Tom

How
can
a

his

something
the

Dr
What
did
they
call
your
father
What
did
your
father
do
Mr
G
Was
he
a
farmer
Sp
No
he
was
not
a
farmer
but
he
had
some
land
We
were
further
down
from
that
college
where
that
church
was
My
father
was
a
German
Mr
G
Was
he
a
Mennonite
Sp
No
my
father
came
where
they
were

went
further
back
What
is
the
matter
with
me
Why
can

I
think
what
my
name

Mr

Tom
will
tell
you
if
you
ask
him
SP
I
can
get
certain
places
and
things
then
I
can
t
go
any
further
I
remember
Fred
because
everybody
called
me
that
Dr
Well
I
wouldn
t
worry
about
it
any
more
Your
memory
will
come
back
to
you
You
are
a
spirit
and
when
you
leave
here
intelligent
spirits
will
take
care
of
you
SP
Tom
says
he
is
going
to
take
me
to
a
home
or
rest
I
have
been
so
worried
and
I
get
so
tired
out
that
I
get
mad
at
everything
I
will
not
be
angry
any
more
Whenever
I
got
mad
I
suffered
terribly
after
it
I
always
felt
so
bad
because
I
could
not
control
myself
I
always
felt
so
sorry
I
said
such
mean
things
and
I
was
too
proud
to
acknowledge
it
but
I
knew
it
just
the
same
Tom
says
Come
on
we
must
go
I
want
to
go
now
To
Mr

Tom
says
I
must
ask
you
if
you
will
forgive
me

making
so
much
mischief

We

you

You
are
not

you
Mr

Not
at
all
Sp
I
feel
so
weak
what
will
I
do
I
am
too
weak
to
go
with
Tom
Dr
That
weakness
is
a
common
experience
with
spirits
when
they
begin
to
understand
It
is
only
a
temporary
sensation
you
are
merely
losing
control
Think
yourself
with
Tom
and
the
Mercy
Band
of
spirits
Sp
My
head
feels
so
funny
Am
I
going
crazy
You
had
better
get
a
doctor
because
I
think
I
am
going
to
die
Dr
You
will
be
all
right
as
soon
as
you
leave
this

I
need
a
doctor

the
blood
is
all
coming
up
in
my
throat
and
I
can
t
breathe
I
feel
so
choked
Maybe
I
can
get
to
sleep
Doctors
always
say
if
you
can
sleep
it
is
better
when
you
feel
weak
I
am
not

the

Mrs
Wickland
then
came
in
and
said
to
Mr
G
We
got
the
man
Now
we
are
going
to
take
him
to
a
hospital
We
worked
hard
to
get
him
he
was
so
in
your
magnetic
aura
that
it
seemed
like
taking
a
piece
out
of
your
body
to
detach
him
from
you
He
had
been
with
you
for
a
long
time
he
was
with
you
when
you
were
a
child
When
things
did
not
go
right
for
him
he
flew
into
a
temper
It
will
be
a
great
relief
to
have
him
away
and
you
will
feel
like
a
new
person
You
will
not
feel
so
irritable
He
has
been
working
on
you
nearly
all
your
life
but
lately
he
has
become
stronger
and
stronger
until
he
almost
had
control
of
you
Now
we
have
him
and
he
won
t
bother
you
any
more
He
is
very
weak
and
needs
hospital
care
he
can
hardly
walk
He
will
have
to
be
nursed
He
has
been
living
on
you
and
with
that
strength
taken
away
from
him
he
is
very
weak
but
he
will
he
taken
care

XII
Selfishness
THOSE
whose
earthly
interests
have
been
superficial
who
have
been
dominated
by
pride
vanity
greed
ambition
and
selfishness
are
held
in
the
earth
sphere
after
transition
until
these
tendencies
have
been
conquered
and
love
and
sympathy
have
been
developed
through
service
for
others
Frequently
spirits
whose
earth
lives
were
spent
in
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
the
pastimes
of
wealthy
society
have
attained
realization
of
a
higher
life
through
our
psychic
circle
Among
these
was
one
who

JOHN

A
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
After
the
spirit
of
W
T
Stead
had
visited
with
us
a
few
moments
another
spirit
came
in
struggling
desperately
as
if
swimming
and
called
loudly
for
aid
Spirit
Help
Help
Doctor
Where
did
you
come
from
Sp
That
man
who
just
left
told
me
to
come
in
here
Dr
Have
you
been
in
the
water
Sp
I
drowned
but
I
have
come
to
life
again
I
cannot
see
that
man
now
but
I
heard
him
talking
and
he
told
me
to
step
in
He
said
that
you
know
the
way
and
would
teach
me
and
that
I
could
go
with
him
afterwards
But
now
I
cannot
see
him
I
m
blind
I
m
blind
I
don
t
know
whether
the
water
blinded
me
or
not
but
I
am
blind
Dr
That
is
only
spiritual
blindness
When
a
person
passes
out
of
his
physical
body
without
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
the
higher
life
he
finds
himself
in
a
condition
of
darkness
It
is
the
darkness
of
ignorance
Sp
Then
I
will
not
always
be
blind
Dr
You
must
realize
that
you
are
in
the
spirit
world
and
that
spirit
friends
are
here
who
will
teach
you
how
to
progress
out
of
your
condition
of
darkness
SP
I
can
see
a
little
now
For
a
while
I
could
see
but
the
door
was
shut
again
and
I
could
not
see
through
I
was
with
my
wife
and
child
for
a
time
but
no
one
noticed
me
But
now
the
door
is
closed
and
I
am
out
in
the
cold
I
am
all
alone
when
I
go
to
my
home
Changes
seem
to
have
taken
place
I
do
not
know
what
I
shall
do
Dr
You
have
not
realized
your
own
situation
Sp
What
is
the
matter
anyway
What
is
causing
this
darkness
What
can
I
do
to
get
out
of
it
I
never
was
so
handicapped
as
I
am
now
I
was
all
right
for
just
a
minute
I
hear
somebody
talking
There
now
I
see
him
again
Was
it
Mr
Stead
Dr
Mr
Stead
was
speaking
through
this
instrument
just
before
you
came
Mr
Stead
probably
brought
you
here
for
help
It
is
our
work
to
awaken
earthbound
spirits
who
are
in
darkness
Sp
This
darkness
is
terrible
I
have
been
in
this
darkness
for
a
long
time
Dr
Understand
that
there
is
no
death
Life
continues
in
the
spirit
world
where
each
one
must
serve
others
in
order
to
progress
Sp
I
really
was
not
what
I
should
have
been
I
just
lived
for
self
I
wanted
amusement
and
to
spend
money
But
now
all
I
have
seen
is
my
past
and
I
have
been
in
the
darkness
and
it
is
terrible
Every
act
of
my
past
stands
before
me
and
I
want
to
run
away
from
it
but
I
cannot
It
is
there
all
the
time
and
accuses
me
because
I
could
have
done
differently
I
have
seen
so
many
places
where
I
could
have
done
good
but
now
it
seems
too
late
Dr
When
a
person
lives
for
self
alone
he
usually
finds
himself
in
darkness
when
he
passes
over
to
the
other
side
of
life
You
must
obtain
understanding
of
the
glories
of
the
spirit
world
and
realize
that
life
there
is
service
to
others
That
is
the
true
Heaven
it
is
a
condition
of
mind
Sp
Why
are
not
these
things
taught
in
the
world
Dr
Would
the
world
listen
Humanity
as
a
whole
does
not
look
for
the
spiritual
side
of
life
but
looks
for
other
things
The
world
is
seeking
for
amusement
and
for
selfish
gain
not
for
truth
Sp
There
is
such
a
queer
feeling
coming
over
me
Mother
Mother
my
loving
mother
Spirit
I
am
a
man
but
I
feel
like
a
child
in
your
arms
again
I
have
been
longing
for
you
but
I
have
been
living
all
by
myself
in
the
terrible
darkness
Why
is
it
that
I
should
be
in
the
dark
Cannot
my
eyes
be
cured
Will
I
be
blind
all
the
time
Isn
t
it
strange
that
I
can
see
you
yet
I
seem
to
be
blind
Dr
You
have
a
spiritual
body
now
and
when
your
spiritual
eyes
are
opened
you
will
see
the
beautiful
things
of
the
spirit
world
Sp
I
see
Mr
Stead
there
We
were
both
on
the
same
boat
but
he
does
not
seem
to
be
in
the
dark
Dr
He
understood
the
truth
of
spirit
return
and
life
on
the
other
side
while
he
was
on
earth
Life
is
a
school
and
we
must
learn
all
we
can
about
the
spirit
side
of
life
while
we
are
on
earth
for
the
only
light
we
have
when
we
pass
to
the
other
side
is
the
knowledge
pertaining
to
life
s
problems
which
we
have
gathered
here
Sp
Why
did
no
one
ever
tell
me
these
things
Dr
Would
you
have
listened
to
any
one
who
would
have
tried
to
talk
to
you
on
these
subjects
Sp
No
one
ever
approached
me
with
such
ideas
Dr
What
year
do
you
think
this
is
Sp
Dr
It
is
Sp
Where
have
I
been
I
have
been
very
hungry
and
cold
I
had
a
very
great
deal
of
money
but
lately
when
I
have
wanted
some
to
spend
I
could
not
get
hold
of
it
Sometimes
I
seemed
to
be
shut
up
in
a
room
very
dark
and
I
could
see
nothing
but
a
procession
of
my
past
life
I
was
not
a
bad
man
but
you
probably
know
what
society
people
are
I
did
not
know
until
now
what
it
was
to
be
poor
It
is
a
new
experience
to
me
Why
should
humanity
not
be
taught
differently
before
death
Then
there
would
not
be
such
suffering
as
I
am
in
now
Dr
If
you
will
go
with
your
mother
and
other
spirit
friends
and
try
to
understand
what
they
tell
you
you
will
feel
much
happier
Sp
I
can
see
Mr
Stead
I
met
him
on
the
boat
but
I
had
no
use
for
his
teachings
I
thought
he
was
old
and
that
he
had
a
hobby
You
know
when
people
get
old
they
have
hobbies
of
one
kind
or
another
I
never
had
time
for
such
things
because
all
I
thought
of
was
my
money
and
society
We
do
not
see
the
poor
people
and
we
do
not
care
to
see
them
I
could
do
so
differently
now
but
money
is
of
no
use
to
me
any
longer
My
mother
is
waiting
for
me
and
I
should
like
to
go
with
her
for
I
have
not
seen
her
for
years
and
it
is
so
good
to
see
her
She
says
she
could
not
reach
me
for
I
was
like
a
crazy
man
and
would
not
listen
to
her
Bless
you
all
for
the
help
you
have
been
to
me
and
for
having
opened
my
eyes
It
is
misery
to
be
blind
yet
able
to
see
the
procession
of
your
past
life
and
not
be
able
to
see
or
hear
anything
else
Dr
We
should
like
to
know
your
name
Sp
I
am
John
J
A
and
I
am
glad
I
met
you
all
I
am
so
grateful
for
what
you
have
told
me
Now
I
can
see
and
hear
and
understand
something
that
I
did
not
know
existed
My
mother
and
friends
are
coming
for
me
and
now
I
am
going
through
that
beautiful
gate
into
what
will
be
to
me
Heaven
I
again
thank
you
all
and
hope
some
day
to
come
and
see
you
again

is
your

Alfred

I
was
on
a
boat
John
J
A
came
and
told
me
he
would
try
to
help
me
get

He
said
if
I
would

in

I
would
get
help
Say
I
have
never
been
hungry
in
my
life
before
but
I
am
both
hungry
and
cold
and
my
clothes
are
all
wet
Dr
That
is
only
a
condition
of
your
mind
You
have
lost
your
physical
body

should
not
feel
the
need
of
food

I
know
I
drowned

I
have
been
in
misery
ever
since
Dr
If
you
had
an
understanding
of
the
life
hereafter
and
of
progression
in
the
spirit
world
you
would
soon
find
happiness
through
serving

I
never
was
happy
I
suppose
I
had
my
own
way
too
much
yet
sometimes
I
felt
what
was
the
use
But
I
thought
Just
forget
yourself
and
have
a
good
time
You
may
not
care
for
society
life
but
in
society
you
can
drown
yourself
in
gaiety
I
really
did
not
care
for
society
life
I
used
to
forget
myself
with
my
horses
If
you
have

he
is
faithful

when

just
show

side
smiles
and
sometimes
they
hate
you
The
love
I
know
most
is
the
love
of
a
beautiful
faithful
horse
Horses
were
my
pleasure
and
I
felt
they
loved
me
Women
liked
me
only
for
what
I
could
do
for
them
they
wanted
money
and
pleasure
Women
wanted
all
the
money
they
could
get
from
me
I
let
go
of
things
and
tried
to
lose
myself
in
pleasure
but
I
was
not
happy
Society
does
not
know
anything
about
honor
and
respectability
If
I
could
find
people
as
faithful
and
true
as
my
horse
was
to
me
I
tell
you
I
would
thank
you
for
that
society
But
go
into
the
kind
of
society
I
have
known
and
men
and
women
are
nothing
I
was
a
sport
myself
but
there
were
things
that
drove
me
to
forget
that
little
thing
within
me
conscience
I
longed
for
something
that
was
good
but
where
can
you
find
it
Not
amongst
society
but
amongst
horses
Society
is
all
right
if
you
want
that
kind
of
a
life
You
will
probably
realize
that
I
developed
a
great
deal
of
selfishness
Dr
You
must
try
now
to
forget
your
past
life
with
all
its
sorrow
and
bitterness
Look
for
higher
things
then
your
spiritual
eyes
will
be
opened
Sp
Friends
that
took
an
interest
in
me
brought
me
here
and
my
eyes
have
been
opened
since
I
came
I
feel
that
probably
but
I
am
not
sure
a
time
may
come
when
I
can
be
happy
I
have
never
been
really
happy
for
when
a
child
I
had
my
own
way
too
much
I
thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
come
here
If
I
ever
am
truly
happy
I
will
come
back
and
tell
you
so
A
sequel
to
the
above
occurred
several
years
later
when

How

I

Dr
Who
brought
you
here
Sp
I
thought
I
had
a
dream
and
that
Alfred
V
came
and
spoke
to
me
He
always
liked
me
but
he
is
dead
Now
he
says
that
I
must
wake
up
I
am
so
sick
My
bones
my
bones
I
don
t
want
to
lose
my
beautiful

I
feel
that
I
am
commencing
to
get
better
and
stronger
Will
I
live
now
and
can
I
perform
again
and
do
my

I
do
not
want
to

my
beautiful
form
Dr
You
will
never
perform
on
the
physical
plane
again
Sp
I
hope
to
Alfred
V
bothered
me
so
much
but
he
is
dead
Dr
Does
he
look
as
though
he
were
dead
Sp
He
seems
to
be
very
well
but
I
thought
I
was
dreaming
Why
here
is
John

They
are
both
dead
Dr
So
are
you
Sp
When
did
I
die
Dr
A
short
time
ago
Sp
Alfred
says
that
they
do
missionary
work
to
wake
up
spirits
But
they
do
not
believe
in
such
things
as
spirits
I
don
t
want
to
die
Dr
Nobody
actually
dies
Sp
Of
course
they
do
The
doctors
said
I
could
never
get
well
I
fought
and
fought
to
live
I
want
to
live
I
want
to
overcome
my
sickness
and
get
well
again
and
I
want
to
retain
my
beautiful
form
Dr
From
now
on
you
must
try
to
develop
a
beautiful
spirit
Sp
The
two
men
want
me
to
go
with
them
to
find
understanding
Dr
They
have
found
the
truth
through
this
little
circle
They
were
very
poor
spiritually
before
they
came
here
but
became
rich
through
an
understanding
of
a
more
beautiful
life
than
they
had
here
on
earth
Sp
What
is
this
place
They
say
it
is
the
Gate
to
the
Understanding
of
Real
Life

Gateway
Noticing

This
dress
does
not
fit
well
Touching

This
is
not

They
say
I
am
weak
yet
but
I
am
to
go
with
them
and
they
will
show
me
the
way
but
that
I
have
much
to
learn
Dr
Did
you
ever
ask
yourself
What
is
Mind
Sp
No
I
just
wanted
my
beautiful

If
it
were
not
for
my
beautiful
form

I
could
not
have
attracted
people
to
me
and
earned
my
living
There
are
quite
a
few
people
here

Alfred
said
if
I
came
here
he
would
bring
me
to
my
relations
and
to
a
beautiful
home
beyond
the
grave
Dr
What
do
they
call
that
place
Sp
I
do
not
like
the
name
but
they
say
The
Spirit
World
They
say
that
is
the
home
beyond
the
grave
They
say
I
shall
have
to
overcome
my
earthly
condition
before
I
can
open
my
psychic
eyes
I
do
not
know
what
they
mean
They
say
if
I
go
with
them
I
will
find
beautiful
conditions
after
I
have
understanding
but
that
I
shall
have
to
overcome
a
great
deal
of
self
and
live
for
others
Alfred
says
that
we
lived
for
society
and
ourselves
and
we
have
to
suffer
for
it
He
says
I
must
go
but
I
cannot
for
I
am
very
sick
Dr
Your
body
was
sick
but
you
have
lost
that
body
It
is

I
feel
better
now

I
did

Alfred

John

at
one
time
controlled

you
are
now
doing

My
bones
are
so
sore

That
is

in
your

do
not
see
you

you
are
invisible

Touching

This
is
not
my
face

I
don

I
want
my
beautiful

It
will
be
your
duty
to
serve
others
in
the
spirit
world
Sp
These
people
want
me
to
go
with
them
They
took
quite
an
interest
in
me
and
my
work
My
pains
seem
to
be
leaving
me
Will
you
please
tell
me
how
I
could
come
here
when
you
are
all
strangers
to
me
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
be
here
tonight
I
feel
so
well
now
Dr
We
are
carrying
on
experimental
work
to
learn
what
becomes
of
the
dead
My
wife
is
a
psychic
and
you
are
controlling
her
body
Sp
Alfred
says
I
must
go
I
thought
I
had
a
dream
and
that
I
was
going
to
die
but
I
fought
and
fought
for
a
long
time
I
did
not
want
to
die
so
I
used
all
my
will
power
to
live
as
long
as
I
could
One
day
I
felt
very
weak
and
I
went
to
sleep
for
quite
a
while
but
I
woke
up
again
as
I
wanted
to
live
They
thought
I
was
dead
but
I
was
not
I
had
only
gone
to
sleep
I
wanted
to
live
because
life
is
dear
to
me
but
I
was
sick
so
long
and
suffered
so
severely
I
went
to
sleep
again
and
I
slept
a
long
time
and
when
I
woke
up
it
was
all
dark
and
I
could
not
see
anything
at
all
Everything
was
dark
dark
dark
I
could
not
find
any
light
and
it
was
so
dark
I
felt
so
distressed
all
dark
I
thought
then
I
went
to
sleep
again
and
as
I
slept
I
dreamed
Alfred
V
and
John
J
A
came
to
me
and
said
Anna
wake
up
We
are
here
to
help
you
Come
with
us
Come
I
thought
I
was
waking
up
but
I
was
so
sick
so
sick
that
I
could
not
go
with
them
My
crippled
body
was
so
sick
They
said
We
will
take
you
to
a
place
where
you
will
have
a
new
body
and
you
will
be
well
and
strong
Come
with
us
to
a
more
beautiful
world
than
this
Here
I
am
all
well
and
strong
Will
I
not
have
those
terrible
pains
again
They
are
so
hard
on
me
I
felt
I
must
not
eat
too
much
or
drink
too
much
or
I
would
not
be
able
to
retain
my
beautiful
form
I
would
not
eat
meat
because
I
would
get
too
fat
and
I
must
eat
just
enough
to
retain
the
roundness
of
my
form
What
have
I
now
Why
did
I
not
do
more
helpful
things
Life
was
so
sweet
I
liked
to
be
flattered
and
I
liked
to
have
admirers
It
is
so
hard
to
lose
your
admirers
Dr
Do
Alfred
V
and
J
A
flatter
you
now
Sp
No
They
do
not
look
as
they
used
to
There
is
a
seriousness
about
them
They
look
so
sincere
that
I
feel
different
with
them
While
to
me
they
look
much
younger
I
know
they
are
older
They
do
not
say
to
me
as
they
did
once
Come
along
and
have
a
good
time
Life
was
very
sweet
while
I
had
admirers
But
I
suffered
for
my
vanity
The
doctors
said
if
I
had
not
laced
so
much
I
would
not
have
been
so
sick
I
would
not
mind
the
doctors
either
They
wanted
me
to
eat
to
get
strength
but
I
was
afraid
if
I
lay
there
and
ate
and
did
not
get
my
regular
massage
and
baths
I
could
not
keep
my
form
so
I
starved
myself
When
I
was
in
the
dark
Alfred
came
to
me
and
said
Come
I
will
show
you
something
far
more
beautiful
than
a
beautiful
form
and
selfishness
and
vanity
They
are
only
shadows
Now
come
and
we
will
show
you
why
we
should
live
for
others
You
will
be
beautiful
again
when
you
have
served
others
but
you
must
forget
self
and
overcome
all
selfishness
Now
I
must
serve
and
I
must
help
Suddenly
the
spirit
lost
control
and
was
gone
Two
years
later
after
Anna
H
had
brought
the
spirits
of
Olive
T
and
Anna
D
to
our
circle
she
spoke
to
us
again
EXPERIENCE

MRS
WICKLAND
Good
Evening
I
came
here
tonight
to
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
I
am
now
very
happy
I
only
lived
for
myself
and
for
my
body
and
beauty
I
lived
only
for
a
good
time
When
you
live
for
a
good
time
you
are
not
really
happy
You
are
always
afraid
that
some
one
will
shine
brighter
than
yourself
or
that
some
one
will
take
your
place
and
charm
away
your
admirers
Here
in
this
room
I
found
harmony
when
I
was
in
such
darkness
I
could
not
see
anything
except
all
the
promises
I
had
made
and
broken
and
I
felt
sad
Now
I
have
understanding
of
the
real
life
The
real
life
is
to
serve
others
to
do
good
for
others
to
help
others
then
you
yourself
will
have
help
This
brings
happiness
which
is
Heaven
it
is
the
Heaven
of
Contentment
When
I
first
came
here
I
was
very
sad
and
gloomy
I
had
only
thought
of
self
with
never
a
thought
of
God
our
Maker
We
should
all
think
of
Him
and
learn
to
know
Him
He
is
the
one
we
should
pray
to
and
we
should
try
to
realize
what
life
is
We
should
learn
to
know
not
be
satisfied
with
blind
belief
Learn
to
understand
God
in
His
truest
sense
I
was
once
quite
a
church
going
girl
I
believed
and
believed
and
condemned
others
and
thought
if
you
did
not
do
so
and
so
you
would
be
lost
That
is
the
reason
many
fall
by
the
wayside
People
only
have
time
for
amusement
They
do
not
go
to
church
Why
are
they
not
taught
to
understand
the
real
Christ
spirit
Give
them
innocent
amusement
of
one
kind
or
another
and
do
not
keep
them
wrapped
in
gloom
praying
and
praying
all
the
time
They
fall
They
want
to
go
to
church
and
they
want
See
Chap
Pages
Spirit
Olive
T
to
have
a
good
time
but
they
are
taught
that
if
they
do
not
go
to
church
and
pray
they
will
fall
lower
and
lower
and
they
will
be
condemned
not
by
God
but
condemned
by
the
people
If
a
girl
falls
who
will
raise
her
up
Does
the
church
do
this
work
No
churches
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
her
because
they
say
she
is
bad
They
say
We
do
not
want
our
daughters
to
go
about
with
her
or
be
seen
in
her
company
because
she
will
make
them
bad
Since
churches
teach
the
Gospel
of
Christ
why
should
they
not
help
such
a
soul
to
rise
Christ
did
not
accuse
the
fallen
woman
He
said
that
he
who
was
without
sin
should
cast
the
first
stone
Because
a
woman
had
fallen
accusers
stood
ready
to
throw
stones
at
her
When
Christ
spoke
the
accusers
went
away
Then
what
did
Christ
do
He
took
her
hand
lifted
her
up
and
said
Where
are
your
accusers
Go
and
sin
no
more
He
meant
she
should
try
to
enter
a
new
life
and
do
better
But
society
will
not
have
her
The
churches
will
not
have
her
She
is
down
Where
will
she
go
Where
can
she
go
She
has
not
sinned
against
any
one
but
herself
Her
own
self
accuses
her
for
what
she
has
done
How
can
she
rise
If
she
goes
to
church
she
will
not
be
helped
there
She
can
only
go
to
the
lowest
condition
where
there
is
a
good
time
and
champagne
and
try
to
drown
her
conscience
Suppose
we
tell
the
people
that
this
unfortunate
girl
has
fallen
has
had
to
go
into
a
wild
underworld
has
been
bad
has
had
no
chance
to
rise
and
that
her
character
has
gone
will
they
help
her
No
they
will
not
We
should
always
try
to
help
others
especially
the
weak
and
fallen
ones
and
try
to
raise
them
as
Christ
taught
us
Do
not
condemn
but
raise
them
to
society
again
and
help
them
to
be
honest
and
sincere
Then
we
shall
convert
the
world
of
men
as
well
as
women
Men
are
also
greatly
to
blame
for
trying
to
ruin
poor
innocent
little
girls
Just
because
a
girl
has
a
beautiful
face
and
has
charms
men
should
not
praise
and
flatter
They
ruin
the
girl
The
man
goes
back
to
society
but
the
girl
goes
lower
and
lower
She
cannot
go
back
to
her
former
life
but
has
to
remain
where
she
is
If
you
could
see
the
lower
life
of
Paris
you
would
shudder
and
realize
that
that
is
hell
People
who
go
there
have
lost
their
pride
their
senses
The
women
there
have
lost
all
modesty
They
do
not
believe
in
God
they
do
not
believe
in
the
Christian
religion
any
more
because
the
Christian
religion
and
its
people
have
driven
them
to
what
they
are
They
think
there
is
no
God
and
so
they
can
do
whatever
they
wish
Let
us
try
to
help
these
unfortunates
I
am
now
working
in
the
slums
of
earthbound
spirits
I
am
serving
There
was
a
time
when
I
would
not
soil
my
hands
to
help
anybody
because
I
had
to
be
waited
on
I
had
my
maid
and
if
I
were
not
waited
on
at
once
just
when
I
wanted
things
I
scolded
and
was
very
irritable
Now
I
wait
on
the
lowest
with
the
true
spirit
of
Christ
who
taught
us
to
serve
others
and
love
others
as
ourselves
and
God
above
all
things
When
the
one
who
has
fallen
by
the
wayside
is
given
true
understanding
then
that
soul
will
serve
and
his
love
for
his
fellow
man
will
be
much
stronger
than
that
of
the
one
who
does
not
have
that
understanding
One
who
has
always
had
a
good
home
gone
to
church
and
is
pure
and
good
knows
nothing
of
evil
Let
us
all
understand
our
Maker
the
God
of
us
all
Our
Maker
is
God
for
the
one
who
has
fallen
just
as
much
as
for
the
pure
God
is
Love
When
you
have
shining
in
your
heart
that
light
of
love
which
is
the
love
of
God
not
love
as
people
understand
it
lukewarm
sentimental
love
but
love
which
has
suffered
and
which
understands
which
does
not
ask
anything
which
sacrifices
and
will
serve
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
that
is
real
true
love
When
people
are
crushed
we
should
raise
them
again
with
love
and
sympathy
then
we
could
not
condemn
any
one
God
does
not
condemn
Why
should
we
God
loves
all
his
children
He
has
given
them
all
free
will
to
go
their
own
way
for
a
while
until
they
are
ready
to
say
Not
my
will
any
longer
but
Thine
Each
one
of
us
has
had
experience
in
one
way
or
another
but
let
us
all
look
to
God
and
let
the
love
of
God
and
understanding
so
shine
in
our
souls
that
each
will
he
a
part
of
that
divine
spirit
of
love
No
minister
no
one
can
reach
you
but
you
yourself
will
have
to
see
and
feel
what
God
really
is
Then
you
will
sin
no
more
That
is
Heaven
that
is
Bliss
It
is
beautiful
it
is
harmonious
When
each
understands
the
other
in
God
s
love
then
there
is
peace
and
harmony
but
you
will
have
to
feel
this
beautiful
condition
which
we
call
Heaven
within
you
You
cannot
be
contented
in
this
beautiful
condition
unless
you
help
others
We
stand
by
our
brothers
and
sisters
We
call
them
so
through
love
of
God
Say
to
those
in
misery
Let
me
reach
my
hand
down
to
you
and
I
will
help
you
to
an
understanding
of
the
true
love
of
God
and
you
too
will
shine
in
this
Heaven
of
Love
From
your
own
home
in
the
spirit
world
you
reach
down
to
the
lower
plane
and
you
see
some
here
some
there
in
all
kinds
of
agony
Some
have
taken
their
own
lives
because
of
disappointment
in
love
Others
are
overcome
by
sickness
Others
are
all
crippled
Others
are
being
punished
by
conscience
Through
lack
of
understanding
they
pray
and
pray
and
sing
They
are
only
ignorant
They
pray
to
the
personal
God
they
believe
in
but
the
poor
things
do
not
understand
the
truth
Others
are
earthbound
because
of
their
belief
They
do
not
want
to
talk
to
you
because
you
do
not
belong
to
their
church
They
say
I
do
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
You
stay
there
and
I
will
stay
here
and
the
praying
and
singing
goes
on
They
do
not
know
that
they
have
passed
out
neither
do
they
know
of
the
wonderful
God
of
Understanding
When
you
have
understanding
the
knowledge
of
God
will
shine
in
your
heart
I
am
in
the
spirit
world
now
and
it
is
all
so
beautiful
but
I
would
not
have
had
all
this
happiness
so
soon
had
I
not
come
here
and
been
given
understanding
I
would
not
have
had
it
if
I
had
not
served
I
have
brought
many
here
who
were
crippled
through
lack
of
understanding
and
they
received
light
These
two
young
girls
Olive
T
and
her
little
friend
Anna
D
who
both
took
their
own
lives
are
ones
whom
I
will
look
after
I
could
do
nothing
with
them
because
they
knew
I
was
dead
Their
fear
of
me
kept
me
from
them
They
shunned
me
I
could
not
reach
them
I
did
not
want
them
to
go
to
any
other
place
I
did
not
want
them
to
go
to
earth
life
and
obsess
some
one
I
brought
both
of
them
here
tonight
and
I
shall
take
them
to
my
home
in
the
spirit
world
I
will
take
care
of
them
and
help
them
to
an
understanding
and
some
day
they
may
come
and
thank
you
as
I
have
come
to
thank
you
tonight
Let
us
all
have
an
understanding
of
truth
Do
not
only
believe
Belief
is
all
right
but
to
your
belief
add
knowledge
and
understanding
of
God
s
wonderful
love
Do
not
let
others
tell
you
they
will
save
you
because
they
cannot
do
it
You
will
have
to
find
the
saving
spirit
within
yourself
When
the
love
of
understanding
shines
in
your
heart
you
will
realize
the
wisdom
of
God
Then
you
will
not
need
to
think
that
God
is
in
His
Heaven
He
is
here
there
and
everywhere
He
is
in
the
drop
of
water
He
is
in
the
flowers
all
are
a
part
of
His
wonderful
work
Let
us
worship
Him
and
let
us
see
Him
with
open
eyes
and
we
will
be
happy
Thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
come
Goodbye
In
Chicago
we
had
known
two
Jewish
ladies
Mrs
Sr
and
Mrs
Simons
who
were
excellent
friends
although
the
latter
was
somewhat
tyrannical
in
her
exactions
She
particularly
disapproved
of
the
automatic
writing
which
her
friend
was
experimenting
with
declaring
that
Spiritualism
was
a
fraud
since
after
death
everyone
became
a
flower
a
bird
or
a
tree
Mrs
Simons
passed
away
in
the
presence
of
her
friend
suffering
from
dropsy
and
intense
lumbago
pains
A
number
of
years
later
when
Mrs
Sr
was
in
California
she
developed
melancholia
and
was
afflicted
so
severely
with
pains
in
her
back
that
she
could
not
walk
erectly
After
spending
three
weeks
in
the
hospital
without
any
improvement
she
came
to
us
and
after
the
following
experience
during
a
circle
at
which
Mrs
Sr
was
present
she
was
entirely
relieved
EXPERIENCE
OCTOBER
Spirit
MRS
SIMONS
Patient
MRS
SR
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
The
controlling
entity
groaned
and
immediately
placed
hands
on
back
apparently
in
great
pain
Doctor
Are
you
in
trouble
Have
you
lost
your
body
without
understanding
it
Spirit
I
don
t
know
Dr
We
can
relieve
your
pain
Tell
us
who
you
are
Sp
I
don
t
know
Dr
Surely
you
know
your
own
name
Sp
I
cannot
think
Dr
How
long
have
you
been
dead
Sp
I
don
t
know
if
I
am
dead
Dr
What
did
your
friends
call
you
Sp
Mrs
Simons
Dr
Where
did
you
live
Sp
Chicago
Dr
Where
did
you
live
in
Chicago
Sp
It
s
a
long
time
ago
and
I
don
t
know
I
have
not
felt
just
right
Dr
In
what
way
Sp
I
felt
so
small
and
was
so
uncomfortable
Dr
Do
you
realize
that
you
were
interfering
with
some
one
Sp
I
know
that
I
am
in
such
a
stupor
I
don
t
feel
natural
Dr
Do
you
know
the
reason
for
that
Sp
No
Dr
You
did
not
believe
in
spirits
did
you
Sp
No
and
I
don
t
believe
it
yet
Dr
Then
you
do
not
believe
in
your
own
self
do
you
You
thought
any
one
who
believed
in
spirits
was
foolish
Is
it
not
foolish
to
be
an
earthbound
spirit
Do
you
realize
that
you
have
been
one
Mrs
Sr
Do
you
know
me
Sp
I
know
that
voice
it
belongs
to
a
friend
of
mine
Dr
Where
is
she
Sp
In
Chicago
Dr
What
was
her
business
Sp
I
don
t
know
Everything
is
so
dark
and
I
cannot
remember
anything
I
know
that
voice
but
I
cannot
tell
you
who
it
belongs
to
I
cannot
remember
her
name
at
all
but
I
knew
her
in
Chicago
She
used
to
call
and
see
me
My
friend
was
always
like
sunshine
to
me
She
helped
me
Dr
What
did
she
do
Sp
She
always
came
with
such
a
nice
cheerful
disposition
but
she
got
interested
in
Spiritualism
once
I
told
her
not
to
bother
with
it
because
there
was
nothing
in
it
I
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
that
I
miss
her
so
I
only
see
her
once
in
a
while
I
feel
so
little
and
uncomfortable
To
save
my
life
I
cannot
think
of
her
name
Dr
What
was
her
first
name
Sp
It
comes
to
me
now
It
was
R
Something
ails
my
memory
and
things
are
so
queer
to
me
Once
in
a
while
I
get
a
glimpse
of
light
then
I
feel
I
am
locked
up
in
a
small
place
You
know
I
am
a
big
woman
and
in
that
little
place
aura
of
patient
I
was
so
crowded
that
I
had
no
feeling
Dr
Did
you
get
warmed
up
occasionally
Sp
Yes
once
in
a
while
I
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
but
something
burns
me
sometimes
Static
treatment
given
patient
Now
it
is
all
dark
dark
I
do
not
see
a
thing
I
do
not
know
which
is
the
best
the
fire
or
being
crowded
so
that
I
got
no
breath
I
could
not
breathe
I
do
not
know
why
it
is
But
I
seemed
to
have
gotten
a
shock
Dr
Did
you
die
from
a
shock
Sp
I
cannot
tell
that
I
am
dead
because
I
do
not
feel
dead
I
have
had
fire
and
sometimes
it
was
like
thunder
shooting
pain
Mrs
Sr
Do
you
remember
Dr
Wickland
Sp
Yes
Mrs
Sr
Do
you
remember
that
machine
he
had
Sp
The
one
that
shot
fire
Mrs
Sr
Yes
and
that
is
the
fire
you
feel
Sp
Why
I
didn
t
take
treatments
from
him
Mrs
Sr
You
have
been
bothering
me
all
these
years
Sp
Why
did
I
bother
you
Mrs
Sr
Have
Doctor
explain
it
to
you
Dr
It
is
not
hard
to
explain
You
are
now
a
spirit
and
have
been
hovering
around
your
friend
That
is
why
you
feel
uncomfortable
You
are
not
in
Chicago
now
you
are
in
California
You
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Don
t
you
remember
Mrs
Sr
Sp
Yes
she
was
in
Chicago
Dr
You
are
both
in
Los
Angeles
now
Sp
I
was
in
Chicago
I
always
had
pains
in
my
legs
and
very
often
in
my
head
Mrs
S
You
gave
me
those
pains
lately
Dr
You
loaned
Mrs
Sr
your
pains
Sp
No
you
are
mistaken
in
that
Mrs
Sr
Do
you
remember
Mrs
Wickland
of
Chicago
Dr
Wickland
s
wife
Do
you
remember
she
was
a
psychic
Sp
I
don
t
seem
to
remember
It
is
strange
I
don
t
know
anything
Mrs
Sr
You
thought
you
knew
so
much
Sp
I
supposed
I
knew
You
meddled
with
that
foolish
thing
Spiritualism
and
I
did
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
Have
you
been
fooling
with
it
again
Mrs
Sr
No
you
have
been
fooling
with
me
Sp
No
I
did
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
I
didn
t
like
that
fire
I
could
not
stand
it
It
chased
me
away
I
suffered
terribly
When
I
was
chased
out
I
was
locked
up
in
a
new
room
Dr
You
were
locked
up
in
a
room
of
ignorance
Mrs
Sr
It
is
a
long
time
since
you
died
Sp
I
am
not
dead
Dr
Look
at
this
hand
Is
that
yours
You
are
using
another
body
now
You
are
proving
that
what
you
thought
was
humbug
is
true
Mrs
Sr
Do
you
know
what
year
it
is
Mrs
Simons
Sp
I
don
t
know
anything
Where
is
my
home
Where
is
my
girl
Mrs
Sr
Your
girl
is
not
here
You
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
No
now
you
are
a
little
off
Mrs
Sr
don
t
you
know
you
are
in
Chicago
Mrs
Sr
I
have
been
here
in
California
for
six
and
one
half
years
Sp
We
are
in
Chicago
Such
a
foolish
woman
She
is
hypnotized
and
wants
to
have
me
believe
such
a
story
Dr
Wouldn
t
you
like
to
understand
matters
You
have
been
dead
a
good
many
years
and
were
hovering
around
your
friend
Mrs
Sr
You
were
driven
away
from
her
by
electricity
Now
you
are
allowed
to
control
my
wife
s
body
temporarily
so
you
may
acquire
understanding
Do
you
know
anything
about
the
purpose
of
life
Did
that
ever
interest
you
No
therefore
you
think
there
could
not
be
anything
in
a
higher
life
You
call
yourself
Mrs
Simons
This
body
belongs
to
Mrs
Wickland
and
she
is
in
Los
Angeles
California
You
claim
you
are
in
Chicago
and
we
cannot
convince
you
of
the
facts
You
have
been
obsessing
Mrs
Sr
Sp
I
came
to
her
because
it
was
so
dark
It
seems
I
had
been
sleeping
for
a
while
then
I
woke
up
I
saw
a
light
then
I
was
here
I
could
see
just
a
little
light
if
I
could
be
with
her
Dr
You
got
into
her
magnetic
aura
and
made
her
suffer
In
order
to
get
you
out
I
applied
electricity
to
her
Mrs
Sr
Do
you
know
what
I
told
Doctor
I
told
him
to
give
you
that
electricity
Sp
You
have
no
sympathy
for
a
poor
old
lady
like
me
Dr
Would
you
have
liked
to
have
an
earthbound
spirit
control
your
body
SP
I
will
not
listen
to
you
Dr
You
are
willing
to
bother
your
friend
Sp
I
do
not
know
whether
I
have
been
bothering
her
I
have
only
been
around
her
to
see
light
Dr
Then
how
did
you
happen
to
get
the
electricity
when
I
gave
it
to
her
I
have
never
treated
you
Mrs
Sr
By
right
you
ought
to
pay
Dr
Wickland
for
that
treatment
Mrs
Simons
Sp
Tell
me
one
thing
how
did
I
come
here
I
do
not
think
you
are
right
Mrs
Sr
but
if
you
should
be
how
did
you
come
to
California
Mrs
Sr
By
paying
my
railroad
fare
I
came
here
Did
you
pay
anything
Sp
I
never
paid
anything
so
how
did
I
get
here
I
don
t
believe
it
anyhow
you
cannot
say
that
to
me
I
am
in
Chicago
and
Mrs
Sr
was
never
in
California
Dr
Do
you
hear
that
rumble
That
is
a
train
leaving
Los
Angeles
for
Chicago
Sp
That
is
the
Northwestern
train
Dr
There
is
no
Northwestern
out
here
What
do
you
gain
by
arguing
When
you
understand
the
situation
you
will
appreciate
what
I
am
trying
to
tell
you
What
would
you
think
of
a
person
who
refused
to
understand
life
who
has
been
dead
seven
or
eight
years
whose
body
is
lost
and
in
the
grave
and
who
is
an
ignorant
spirit
bothering
one
who
was
formerly
a
friend
Sp
I
cannot
see
how
that
is
Dr
We
are
telling
you
facts
Mrs
Sr
Your
body
was
buried
in
Waltheim
Cemetery
six
or
eight
years
ago
Sp
I
have
been
sleeping
I
woke
up
with
very
severe
pains
and
I
could
not
move
very
well
and
I
felt
so
crowded
Dr
That
was
because
Mrs
Sr
s
body
is
smaller
than
yours
and
you
have
been
obsessing
her
Sp
How
could
I
get
in
that
body
I
felt
I
could
hardly
move
I
have
to
find
out
what
you
are
talking
about
I
don
t
believe
it
I
want
to
know
what
object
you
have
to
say
such
things
Dr
Did
you
ever
study
Life
at
all
Sp
I
studied
trees
and
Nature
Dr
Did
you
ever
observe
how
the
tree
grows
It
is
wonderful
God
puts
life
into
it
and
it
grows
What
is
life
Sp
God
I
suppose
Dr
Have
you
ever
seen
mind
Sp
Mind
is
mind
Dr
Have
you
ever
seen
mind
Sp
No
you
could
not
talk
if
you
had
no
mind
Dr
Mind
is
invisible
isn
t
it
Sp
I
haven
t
seen
it
Dr
Suppose
we
tell
you
that
you
are
invisible
to
us
When
I
speak
to
you
I
can
see
only
my
wife
s
body
Sp
Your
wife
s
body
Mrs
Sr
what
is
the
matter
Have
I
lost
my
body
Mrs
Sr
Yes
you
have
Dr
Only
your
stubbornness
keeps
you
in
the
dark
Sp
I
haven
t
seen
or
heard
anything
There
was
a
time
I
tell
you
when
I
walked
on
and
on
but
always
in
the
dark
and
it
seemed
like
I
never
could
get
there
I
rested
then
I
kept
on
walking
At
first
I
could
see
just
a
little
light
and
it
seems
like
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
Mrs
Sr
I
thought
Yes
she
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
then
I
could
see
her
Dr
You
transferred
yourself
by
thought
Sp
Then
I
had
a
terrible
pain
I
thought
I
had
lost
all
my
pain
for
a
little
while
I
woke
up
and
felt
no
pain
at
first
but
when
I
got
to
that
light
all
the
pain
came
back
Dr
You
had
pain
when
you
had
your
body
You
must
understand
you
are
a
spirit
invisible
to
us
When
an
earthbound
spirit
comes
in
touch
with
a
mortal
body
he
again
has
the
pains
he
passed
out
with
You
got
in
touch
with
Mrs
Sr
and
had
your
mortal
pains
again
You
have
caused
trouble
You
were
selfish
and
you
have
not
gained
anything
by
it
In
the
spirit
world
you
will
have
to
serve
others
Realize
that
you
are
now
a
spirit
you
no
longer
have
a
physical
body
Why
did
you
not
become
a
tree
as
you
expected
to
Mrs
Sr
Your
body
is
buried
in
Waltheim
Cemetery
Chicago
Go
to
the
cemetery
and
see
if
you
have
a
tombstone
there
Sp
I
don
t
want
to
go
and
examine
my
tombstone
in
the
cemetery
Dr
Did
you
go
to
church
Sp
I
believed
that
when
I
died
there
was
nothing
more
I
didn
t
want
to
have
such
foolish
thoughts
as
you
had
Mrs
Sr
I
had
my
own
ideas
and
did
not
need
yours
Dr
God
created
the
world
but
you
did
not
investigate
anything
Sp
In
great
excitement
My
God
My
God
I
see
my
mother
Spirit
Why
she
is
in
her
grave
yes
many
years
ago
It
must
be
a
ghost
She
looks
so
beautiful
Dr
She
did
not
limit
her
mind
as
you
did
She
did
not
want
to
be
a
tree
You
must
be
willing
to
learn
Jesus
said
Except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
Sp
Of
Jewish
faith
I
do
not
believe
in
Jesus
Dr
What
you
believe
or
what
you
do
not
believe
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
of
life
Sp
Mother
is
that
really
you
Why
look
at
that
beautiful
road
with
beautiful
trees
and
flowers
See
that
beautiful
garden
and
those
beautiful
houses
and
my
mother
walking
around
Dr
Your
mother
is
not
a
tree
is
she
Sp
Now
she
is
walking
on
that
beautiful
road
She
says
Come
this
is
my
home
Her
home
but
not
mine
Can
t
I
go
with
my
mother
Dr
Ignorance
cannot
enter
the
Kingdom
of
Heaven
Sp
Look
at
that
steep
hill
which
I
have
to
climb
I
cannot
climb
that
hill
with
the
big
body
I
have
Mother
says
No
you
cannot
climb
it
with
your
body
but
you
have
to
climb
the
hill
of
understanding
and
you
must
forget
yourself
Forget
that
you
have
existed
in
your
selfishness
You
must
serve
I
know
I
know
Yes
I
was
selfish
Mother
I
will
try
but
help
me
Help
me
up
there
I
cannot
do
it
alone
Crying
I
cannot
stay
in
this
misery
any
longer
Take
me
take
me
Mother
with
you
Take
me
with
you
and
show
me
She
says
I
must
work
and
not
be
lazy
as
I
was
in
life
and
expect
everybody
to
do
something
for
me
If
they
did
not
do
what
I
wanted
then
I
got
angry
My
mother
says
Now
you
have
to
serve
You
have
to
work
to
climb
this
hill
of
understanding
to
a
higher
life
You
have
now
to
learn
the
first
lesson
of
life
the
lesson
of
understanding
and
you
will
have
to
go
up
that
hill
until
you
have
gotten
away
from
all
selfishness
jealousy
and
envy
You
must
do
that
You
must
also
ask
forgiveness
for
what
you
have
done
to
Your
old
friend
You
will
have
to
do
it
my
mother
says
You
will
have
to
be
forgiven
Crying
No
you
must
ask
for
forgiveness
because
you
have
been
selfish
very
selfish
All
thoughts
of
self
must
be
thrown
away
and
you
must
live
for
others
I
am
your
mother
but
I
cannot
take
you
to
my
home
yet
because
you
must
learn
Doubtfully
She
says
she
is
my
mother
but
I
do
not
know
Yes
I
believe
it
must
be
but
she
looks
so
beautiful
Dr
That
is
because
she
is
filled
with
the
spirit
of
truth
Sp
Mrs
Sr
if
I
ask
you
to
forgive
me
will
you
forgive
me
Mrs
Sr
I
surely
will
You
didn
t
know
any
better
Sp
You
have
helped
me
to
light
and
it
was
because
of
you
that
I
reached
this
understanding
Mrs
S
You
must
thank
the
Wicklands
for
it
Sp
I
don
t
feel
like
thanking
them
for
it
Mother
says
I
must
because
I
would
still
be
in
that
terrible
pain
and
agony
but
for
them
She
says
I
got
into
your
magnetic
aura
with
a
mind
full
of
pain
and
selfishness
and
envy
Love
was
not
in
me
except
selfish
love
and
she
says
now
I
must
have
love
for
others
and
not
self
Forget
self
and
work
for
others
then
she
says
I
will
be
happy
Dr
Love
is
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
Sp
I
don
t
know
I
didn
t
have
much
interest
in
those
things
I
now
see
myself
as
I
was
I
was
a
bundle
of
selfishness
Mrs
Sr
I
must
also
ask
you
to
forgive
me
because
many
times
I
spoke
to
you
in
a
very
rude
way
and
I
was
selfish
I
felt
people
should
always
come
to
see
me
and
they
had
to
do
it
I
see
now
my
selfishness
Mrs
Sr
please
forgive
me
I
ask
it
now
from
my
heart
I
see
now
but
before
I
did
not
want
to
see
it
because
that
was
putting
my
past
life
before
me
and
how
I
had
lived
for
self
I
do
not
want
that
evil
ugly
homely
body
of
mine
which
they
guiding
intelligences
show
me
That
is
not
my
body
Dr
That
is
your
spiritual
body
for
you
have
made
no
other
You
have
made
a
spiritual
body
of
only
selfishness
and
jealousy
Sp
It
is
all
crippled
and
wrinkled
Dr
You
will
have
to
alter
it
by
your
good
acts
for
others
You
will
have
to
wear
the
garment
you
made
until
you
have
earned
another
Sp
To
think
I
should
have
to
wear
such
an
ugly
homely
old
fool
thing
That
that
spiritual
body
of
mine
just
because
I
did
not
do
anybody
any
good
Dr
You
will
have
to
wear
that
and
be
happy
until
you
have
learned
how
to
earn
another
and
to
climb
the
hill
of
understanding
and
wisdom
Sp
So
I
have
to
live
now
in
that
awful
body
of
mine
I
have
to
get
in
Dr
Serve
serve
your
fellow
man
Sp
I
will
be
brave
and
I
will
try
because
now
I
see
what
I
should
have
done
but
I
did
not
do
it
They
say
it
is
not
too
late
and
I
will
try
to
wear
that
body
all
wrinkled
and
so
homely
They
tell
me
I
can
soon
wear
it
out
by
good
acts
and
each
time
I
do
some
good
act
some
wrinkles
will
be
taken
away
and
there
will
be
a
change
for
the
better
I
will
try
to
be
happy
It
is
hard
Mrs
Sr
help
me
Dr
We
will
all
help
you
Sp
Give
me
some
little
sympathy
because
I
have
to
be
in
that
terrible
homely
body
of
mine
that
I
have
made
only
by
selfishness
and
hate
I
will
wear
it
until
I
can
do
better
I
need
help
and
strength
so
that
I
can
stand
it
Mrs
Sr
forgive
me
They
say
I
have
done
harm
to
you
and
that
now
I
have
to
wear
that
homely
body
and
have
to
serve
you
I
will
serve
you
and
help
you
My
first
lesson
will
be
how
to
be
kind
I
will
I
will
Dr
You
will
find
many
good
friends
who
will
help
you
Ask
the
intelligent
spirits
to
help
you
Will
you
ask
them
Sp
Yes
I
will
They
say
I
must
thank
you
for
those
thundershots
Dr
Do
you
believe
in
spirits
now
Sp
I
must
I
suppose
Don
t
be
like
I
was
selfish
but
do
what
you
can
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
get
into
a
crippled
up
body
like
mine
They
say
no
one
can
help
us
to
work
out
our
own
salvation
Make
your
spirit
body
more
beautiful
than
mine

I
will
go
and

my
work
Goodby
Miss
F
H
a
talented
young
musician
of
gentle
disposition
was
a
student
in
college
when
she
suddenly
became
violent
and
destructive
tore
her
clothes
into
shreds
and
struck
every
one
who
came
near
her
She
was
finally
placed
in
a
sanitarium
kept
in
a
locked
room
for
some
time
and
her
case
diagnosed
as
dementia
praecox
When
brought
to
our
Institute
she
had
become
almost
a
skeleton
At
this
time
she
declared
constantly
her
name
was
not
Miss
H
but
that
she
was
Margaret
Young
of
England
and
had
two
children
One
noon
as
Miss
H
was
seated
at
the
table
Mrs
Wickland
clairvoyantly
saw
the
spirit
of
a
newsboy
take
possession
of
the
patient
and
reach
eagerly
for
food
exclaiming
Gee
whiz
I
m
hungry
I
haven
t
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
long
time
His
hunger
satisfied
the
newsboy
left
and
after
this
occurrence
the
spirit
of
Margaret
Young
ceased
tormenting
the
patient
Miss
F
H
had
with
her
as
companion
a
younger
sister
Miss
C
H
who
understood
obsession
and
was
of
great
help
to
her
One
afternoon
while
Miss
F
H
was
seated
at
the
piano
she
suddenly
became
controlled
by
a
strange
entity
but
the
sister
sharply
ordered
the
intruder
to
leave
and
the
patient
again
became
herself
This
spirit
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
during
a
physic
circle
held
that
evening
and
after
this
the
patient
improved
rapidly
Within
four
months
she
returned
to
her
home
entirely
well
graduated
from
college
and
later
took
up
music
professionally

Doctor
Where
did
you
come
from
Spirit
I
came
here
as
a
visitor
Dr
Would
you
please
introduce
yourself
Sp
I
must
find
out
where
I
am
I
do
not
know
any
of
you
people
Dr
Will
you
please
tell
us
who
you
are
Sp
I
do
not
know
whether
I
want
to
tell
you
who
I
am
Dr
Then
tell
us
how
long
you
have
been
dead
Sp
Dead
Dr
Do
you
understand
your
situation
Why
are
you
here
Sp
I
do
not
know
what
I
came
here
for
Somebody
told
me
to
come
in
here
but
I
do
not
see
any
object
in
coming
Dr
Perhaps
we
may
learn
something
from
you
You
could
tell
us
about
your
life
and
present
condition
Tell
us
who
you
are
introduce
yourself
Sp
Oh
I
do
not
know
Dr
Who
told
you
to
come
in
here
Do
you
know
the
party
Sp
No
I
was
walking
around
trying
to
find
some
place
Everything
had
been
so
dark
and
I
have
been
walking
such
a
long
time
and
I
am
very
tired
I
do
not
want
to
be
talked
to
I
want
to
rest
Dr
You
cannot
do
that
because
you
are
a
stranger
here
Are
you
a
man
or
a
woman
Sp
That
s
a
very
strange
question
to
ask
Dr
It
may
seem
so
to
you
Sp
Can
t
you
see
whether
I
am
a
man
or

dress
differently

This

you

I
most
certainly
am
not

Were
you
a
woman
or
a
girl
Sp
I
have
not
changed
to
a
man
I
tell
you
Dr
You
evidently
changed
your
bodily
form
If
I
tell
you
that
this
is
the
body
of
my
wife
you
would
be
surprised
Evidently
you
are
still
asleep
Sp
Asleep
this
time
of
day
Dr
Why
not
try
to
understand
matters
You
know
you
are
in
a
strange
situation
Try
to
understand
it
try
to
learn
the
reason
This
body
is
not
your
own
Sp
How
you
talk
I
came
into
this
room
and
I
certainly
could
not
come
in
without
a
body
I
did
not
come
in
like
a
feather
floating
around
Dr
Do
you
recognize
these
hands
Sp
Those
hands
belong
to
me
Dr
I
want
you
to
understand
that
you
are
using
some
one
s
body
temporarily
You
do
not
recognize
these
hands
Sp
I
am
not
used
to
such
treatment
Haughtily
I
used
to
be
in
society
General
laughter
Oh
dear
Everyone
is
laughing
at
me
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
it
is
so
provoking
Dr
Did
you
have
a
great
deal
of
wealth
when
you
had
your
own
body
Sp
Why
should
I
tell
you
of
my
affairs
Dr
Were
you
only
pretending
to
be
aristocratic
Sp
I
never
heard
such
talk
before
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
but
do
not
understand
your
condition
Sp
I
can
t
see
how
I
happened
to
come
here
Struggling
to
leave
Dr
You
must
be
sensible
and
listen
to
reason
Sp
Oh
dear
What
shall
I
do
Why
should
you
hold
my
hands
Dr
I
am
not
holding
your
hands
I
am
holding
my
wife
s
hands
Sp
I
am
not
your
wife
Dr
Ask
these
persons
if
this
is
not
my
wife
Sp
I
do
not
know
these
people
and
I
do
not
care
to
Dr
When
you
are
ready
to
talk
we
will
talk
sensibly
Sp
You
need
not
dictate
to
me
Dr
How
long
have
you
been
dead
Sp
Dead
What
are
you
talking
about
I
have
never
died
Dr
You
have
lost
your
physical
body
and
have
evidently
been
wandering
around
for
a
long
time
You
are
allowed
to
control
my
wife
s
body
and
you
must
behave
sensibly
Sp
I
do
not
like
that
girl
with
the
yellow
waist
Miss
C
R
the
patient
s
sister
She
bothers
me
so
very
much
She
drove
me
away
when
I
was
getting
along
so
nicely
To
Miss
C
H
What
right
have
you
to
do
that
to
me
I
do
not
like
you
one
bit
Dr
She
probably
drove
out
an
earthbound
spirit
You
do
not
realize
your
own
condition
Sp
She
chased
me
away
and
I
don
t
like
her
Dr
You
were
controlling
her
sister
and
she
did
not
like
it
You
are
an
earthbound
spirit
Sp
I
am
no
such
thing
Stamping
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
ignorant
of
your
actual
condition
Sp
You
need
not
talk
to
me
I
will
not
listen
to
you
Dr
Do
you
realize
that
you
are
using
another
person
s
body
Sp
You
certainly
are
crazy
Dr
Do
you
not
wish
to
be
helped
Sp
Do
you
think
I
need
your
help
Why
I
came
in
here
just
to
see
what
things
were
I
have
been
walking
so
long
and
then
there
was
a
litle
light
aura
of
sensitive
and
that
girl
in
the
yellow
waist
talked
to
me
as
if
she
owned
the
whole
earth
Talking
to
me
like
that
Dr
Does
it
not
seem
strange
to
you
that
you
are
in
the
dark
Sp
I
was
lost
and
have
been
walking
around
for
a
long
time
It
has
been
very
dark
and
I
have
felt
so
badly
I
have
not
seen
anything
Dr
Strive
to
understand
why
you
are
in
the
dark
Sp
I
heard
music
patient
at
piano
so
I
thought
I
would
listen
to
it
and
then
before
I
knew
it
I
saw
a
light
and
then
came
this
thing
to
me
Miss
C
H
and
talked
as
if
she
owned
the
earth
Dr
Let
me
tell
you
something
This
girl
s
sister
is
a
psychic
sensitive
and
has
been
controlled
by
different
spirits
who
have
disturbed
her
life
Today
she
was
playing
the
piano
you
listened
and
got
in
touch
with
her
magnetic
aura
Through
that
you
saw
a
little
light
and
then
you
controlled
the
girl
Sp
I
have
never
seen
you
before
today
young
lady
To
Miss
F
H
Dr
At
the
present
time
you
are
controlling
my
wife
s
body
Sp
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
that
Dr
Can
t
you
understand
what
I
am
telling
you
Sp
I
do
not
understand
it
one
bit
about
controlling
How
can
I
control
another
body
That
is
such
nonsense
Dr
My
wife
is
a
psychic
sensitive
and
allows
spirits
to
control
her
body
Sp
Spiritualists
then
I
suppose
you
are
all
Spiritualists
I
see
I
see
They
are
all
crazy
all
crazy
Dr
You
are
proving
the
fallacy
of
your
thinking
at
the
present
moment
You
are
a
spirit
and
are
using
my
wife
s
body
Sp
Keep
still
with
that
wife
business
I
was
never
married
and
I
certainly
will
not
marry
you
Dr
I
said
this
is
my
wife
s
body
Sp
There
you
are
again
insinuating
about
the
wife
business
This
body
belongs
to
me
Dr
For
a
little
while
only
Sp
Have
you
ever
seen
a
person
change
bodies
What
are
you
talking
about
Dr
Did
you
ever
stop
to
consider
what
mind
is
Sp
That
belongs
to
the
soul
and
the
soul
is
part
of
the
Divine
God
Dr
That
sounds
very
well
Do
you
understand
what
God
is
I
am
trying
to
reach
your
understanding
You
have
lost
your
body
and
are
now
a
spirit
absolutely
invisible
to
us
Sp
Crazy
crazy
crazy
You
are
the
craziest
person
I
ever
saw
Dr
How
would
you
explain
the
situation
Sp
That
girl
came
to
me
with
such
force
and
told
me
to
get
out
and
before
I
knew
it
I
was
gone
I
stayed
around
and
tried
and
tried
to
get
back
because
I
was
not
going
to
be
driven
out
as
she
thought
I
have
been
watching
for
another
chance
to
get
in
again
and
here
I
am
and
now
you
can
t
drive
me
out
Dr
Should
not
such
an
experience
cause
you
to
think
Sp
Why
should
I
Dr
You
realize
that
you
are
in
a
strange
condition
You
are
very
selfish
you
know
that
I
am
telling
the
truth
Sp
You
have
not
told
me
any
truth
yet
Dr
Ask
one
of
these
gentlemen
whose
hands
I
am
holding
Ans
The
doctor
is
holding
his
wife
s
hands
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
and
are
invisible
to
us
I
am
holding
the
hands
of
Mrs
Wickland
Sp
How
in
the
world
am
I
Mrs
Wickland
Dr
You
are
not
Mrs
Wickland
You
are
only
using
her
body
Sp
Now
you
know
we
cannot
change
bodies
I
know
this
Dr
You
have
lost
your
own
body
and
are
a
spirit
Sp
Then
why
did
I
lose
it
If
I
were
dead
and
had
lost
my
body
how
in
the
world
could
I
have
been
walking
around
as
I
have
been
I
was
so
hungry
for
a
while
and
I
wanted
to
get
something
to
eat
but
that
thing
pointing
to
Miss
C
H
chased
me
out
I
put
up
some
fight
because
I
was
so
hungry
Dr
It
is
your
body
that
is
dead
you
have
lost
that
but
you
yourself
are
not
dead
Paul
said
There
is
a
natural
body
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body
You
have
lost
your
natural
body
Sp
When
did
I
do
that
Dr
I
do
not
know
After
you
stepped
out
of
your
physical
body
you
continued
to
live
in
your
spiritual
body
You
were
brought
here
to
obtain
an
understanding
of
your
condition
When
you
have
that
you
will
not
need
to
walk
in
the
darkness
any
longer
You
will
then
have
an
understanding
of
the
spirit
life
Sp
I
have
been
walking
but
I
am
on
earth
not
in
Heaven
Dr
What
do
you
understand
Heaven
to
be
Sp
That
is
where
God
is
Dr
The
Bible
says
God
is
Love
and
Ye
are
the
temple
of
God
and
the
Spirit
of
God
dweIleth
in
you
If
you
have
love
in
your
heart
then
you
are
a
part
of
God
Sp
I
have
always
done
the
very
best
I
could
Dr
Do
you
know
what
year
it
is
It
is
Can
you
realize
that
you
have
been
in
the
dark
for
some
time
Sp
I
have
been
in
the
dark
and
cannot
remember
things
very
well
Dr
That
is
because
you
have
lost
all
physical
contact
and
have
no
understanding
of
the
higher
life
You
have
been
brought
here
for
the
purpose
of
being
helped
You
can
only
stay
for
a
short
time
Sp
But
where
will
I
go
Dr
To
the
spirit
world
What
is
your
name
Sp
I
do
not
know
Miss
C
H
You
told
it
to
me
this
afternoon
You
said
your
name
was
Mary
Bulwer
and
that
you
were
from
Germany
Sp
I
did
not
say
that
You
were
speaking
to
my
friend
at
that
time
Another
spirit
controlling
patient
Dr
Do
you
realize
where
you
are
now
Do
you
know
that
you
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
No
Dr
Where
do
you
think
you
are
Sp
My
friend
and
I
were
traveling
on
the
railroad
Dr
Did
something
happen
Sp
We
were
going
to
now
I
can
t
remember
where
Oh
Mary
To
a
spirit
Don
t
go
You
know
you
were
my
companion
my
traveling
companion
I
always
paid
your
way
and
you
must
not
leave
me
now
Dr
What
does
she
say
she
is
going
to
do
Sp
Mary
won
t
you
please
tell
me
my
name
Look
Look
at
that
fire
The
whole
thing
is
on
fire
Dr
You
are
again
going
through
the
condition
under
which
you
passed
out
Sp
Mary
Mary
look
at
that
fire
Dr
Were
you
in
a
railroad
accident
Sp
Yes
yes
Dr
That
has
all
passed
Sp
Look
at
Mary
She
s
dead
She
was
crushed
Dr
They
are
revealing
to
you
the
conditions
under
which
you
passed
out
That
is
all
in
the
past
You
must
quiet
yourself
Sp
I
only
got
a
glimpse
of
it
for
just
a
minute
Dr
What
does
Mary
say
Does
she
understand
that
she
has
passed
out
Sp
She
is
lost
and
so
am
I
We
are
both
lost
We
lost
our
way
Dr
That
is
because
you
are
ignorant
of
the
real
life
If
you
had
had
understanding
when
you
had
your
physical
body
you
would
not
have
been
lost
Sp
I
have
been
walking
and
Mary
is
dead
Dr
She
is
not
really
dead
she
only
lost
her
physical
body
Mary
is
no
more
dead
than
you
are
You
are
both
spirits
Sp
I
died
in
that
terrible
fire
Look
at
them
all
All
those
people
are
burning
up
Greatly
excited
Dr
Forget
the
accident
and
collect
yourself
Try
to
calm
yourself
and
forget
the
past
Sp
Agitated
at
sight
of
several
spirits
I
don
t
want
to
see
them
any
of
them
Look
at
that
one
He
is
coming
he
s
coming
I
don
t
want
to
see
you
I
don
t
want
you
and
I
told
you
I
did
not
want
you
Dr
You
probably
wronged
these
persons
in
life
and
are
now
having
to
meet
the
consequences
Sp
I
just
had
a
good
time
with
you
but
I
don
t
care
for
you
I
only
wanted
to
see
how
much
you
loved
me
but
I
don
t
love
you
Now
they
say
they
come
to
accuse
me
I
do
not
want
any
of
them
There
are
three
Dr
Men
or
women
Sp
I
do
not
love
a
woman
Why
do
they
come
here
Dr
What
does
your
conscience
tell
you
Sp
Sneeringly
He
killed
himself
because
I
would
not
marry
him
the
fool
Dr
Didn
t
you
play
vampire
in
the
first
place
Sp
That
s
my
affair
Dr
You
will
now
have
to
strive
to
do
better
Sp
Let
me
remain
in
darkness
it
is
far
better
than
this
There
I
just
walked
I
did
not
see
anything
but
I
am
tired
of
walking
Dr
What
does
your
conscience
tell
you
Sp
Do
not
talk
to
me
about
conscience
Dr
Jesus
said
Except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
You
will
have
to
start
a
new
life
you
will
have
to
develop
a
newness
of
spirit
Sacrifice
self
You
will
have
to
sacrifice
self
and
become
as
a
little
child
you
will
have
to
correct
your
mistakes
Sp
To
another
spirit
What
have
you
to
do
with
me
now
Dr
You
have
wronged
these
men
you
speak
of
Sp
There
is
a
woman
here
too
What
have
you
to
do
with
me
I
said
No
I
never
paid
her
for
my
dresses
Accusing
me
just
because
I
did
not
pay
Dr
Was
that
the
right
thing
to
do
Your
conscience
told
you
what
you
should
have
done
Now
you
will
have
to
serve
others
Selfishness
is
the
root
of
all
evil
Sp
I
was
taught
nothing
except
to
have
a
good
time
and
spend
money
Money
was
just
what
I
was
taught
in
my
childhood
to
be
proud
of
Not
a
serious
thought
for
any
one
that
was
beneath
me
Why
should
I
have
been
taught
that
and
now
have
to
suffer
for
it
Dr
Was
truth
in
your
heart
Sp
I
was
taught
always
to
have
the
respect
of
others
and
to
remember
that
I
was
rich
and
that
I
should
have
all
the
world
could
give
me
I
wanted
money
and
when
I
broke
a
heart
it
was
good
cheer
to
me
To
spirits
I
said
Don
t
come
don
t
come
Dr
You
have
been
brought
here
for
help
lie
quiet
and
listen
to
me
You
will
now
have
to
try
to
undo
your
mistakes
Sp
I
could
never
do
that
Dr
You
can
and
you
will
Others
are
here
to
help
you
and
they
will
show
you
a
better
way
Don
t
be
selfish
Sp
I
am
very
selfish
and
I
have
always
been
very
selfish
was
never
taught
anything
else
My
mother
was
a
proud
woman
and
she
was
very
pretty
Dr
Unfortunately
for
you
You
must
quiet
yourself
you
have
been
allowed
to
come
here
for
help
Do
you
see
any
one
else
you
know
Sp
I
do
not
care
to
look
around
any
more
I
see
only
those
whom
I
have
wronged
They
are
all
standing
here
Oh
Shrinking
back
Why
should
I
suffer
so
Dr
You
created
that
suffering
yourself
There
is
help
for
you
if
you
will
be
sincere
Intelligent
spirits
will
help
you
Sp
I
thought
that
I
could
live
and
have
a
good
time
I
traveled
everywhere
I
wanted
to
go
I
saw
everything
and
had
everything
I
wanted
that
money
could
buy
Every
wish
I
had
was
gratified
Dr
You
stupified
your
soul
You
will
now
have
to
undo
your
own
follies
by
kindness
You
will
have
to
serve
others
Sp
I
cannot
serve
anybody
They
will
have
to
serve
me
I
have
never
done
anything
in
my
life
I
have
always
been
waited
on
Dr
Understand
that
unless
you
help
these
spirits
you
will
continue
to
suffer
You
will
have
nothing
but
the
torment
of
your
own
conscience
until
you
ask
for
mercy
and
say
I
will
serve
Sp
I
never
can
wait
on
any
one
that
would
be
a
step
beneath
me
What
would
my
mother
say
if
I
should
wait
on
any
one
beneath
me
Dr
There
is
nobody
beneath
you
Money
does
not
make
intelligence
nor
merit
Sp
Nobody
beneath
me
Would
I
associate
with
my
dressmaker
Dr
When
you
go
to
the
spirit
world
you
will
probably
find
that
your
humblest
servant
has
a
higher
position
than
you
have
You
will
often
find
that
the
people
you
think
beneath
you
have
the
most
beautiful
homes
in
the
spirit
world
You
have
much
to
do
to
overcome
your
own
disposition
There
are
many
advanced
spirits
here
who
will
help
you
Jesus
taught
us
that
we
must
humble
ourselves
Sp
You
do
not
know
what
that
would
mean
to
me
Dr
My
wife
allows
spirits
of
all
kinds
to
control
her
brain
and
body
Would
you
be
willing
to
sacrifice
yourself
as
she
does
She
allows
you
to
control
her
body
so
we
can
help
you
to
a
better
understanding
Look
around
and
you
will
find
spirits
here
who
will
help
you
Sp
Oh
Rudolph
Spirit
I
loved
you
but
you
know
that
my
pride
and
my
mother
would
not
consent
to
our
marriage
I
know
you
suffered
but
you
did
not
know
that
I
suffered
also
You
know
you
could
not
give
me
the
social
standing
I
was
used
to
I
loved
you
and
I
love
you
yet
Rudolph
will
you
forgive
me
I
would
have
liked
to
have
married
you
Rudolph
but
I
could
not
Dr
Why
should
pride
and
money
be
obstacles
to
love
Sp
I
was
not
happy
but
I
had
to
crush
that
I
did
not
dare
go
contrary
to
my
mother
I
had
to
shine
in
society
with
a
broken
heart
I
had
to
smile
at
all
those
fools
I
had
to
be
another
person
when
my
heart
and
love
were
with
you
Rudolph
but
forgive
me
I
know
you
suffered
I
went
to
your
funeral
but
mother
did
not
know
it
I
wished
I
were
dead
and
could
go
with
you
but
I
had
to
close
the
door
to
love
From
the
moment
you
had
gone
I
said
I
would
conquer
and
shut
out
love
and
sympathy
and
I
would
now
live
for
selfishness
and
let
others
suffer
as
I
had
suffered
for
the
love
I
had
to
shut
out
of
my
heart
Rudolph
forgive
and
help
me
You
were
such
a
good
man
but
religion
and
money
and
mother
stood
between
us
and
love
You
were
poor
but
you
were
good
He
says
if
he
could
have
been
with
me
he
could
have
taught
me
to
be
a
good
woman
Yes
Rudolph
but
the
good
influence
you
brought
with
you
was
shut
out
for
me
then
I
did
not
care
what
became
of
me
I
went
into
society
and
had
a
good
time
trying
to
drown
my
sorrow
I
tried
to
lead
every
man
on
so
that
I
could
get
him
down
at
my
feet
I
did
not
care
if
I
crushed
men
I
wanted
others
to
suffer
as
I
had
suffered
Dr
That
was
selfish
Sp
I
was
taught
nothing
but
selfishness
Dr
What
does
Rudolph
say
Sp
He
says
Alice
come
with
me
to
the
spirit
world
Crying
He
says
in
Heaven
there
is
no
pride
to
interfere
all
is
love
and
harmony
Dr
We
can
help
you
Strive
to
understand
When
you
realize
the
better
life
you
will
have
much
to
do
to
correct
your
mistakes
You
can
undo
your
mistakes
by
kindness

others
You
will
have
to
work
out
your
own
salvation

Stooping
forward
Carl
don
t
go
I
know
you
meant
well

I
could

another

knew

was
at
fault

you
killed
yourself

That

form

what
is
the
matter
with
you

says
Alice
I
am
at
fault
in
the
way
I
brought
you
up
I
am
at
fault
for
not
bringing
you
up

be
a
better

were
I
am
at
fault
for
breaking
up
that
true
love
with
Rudolph
which
probably
would
have
brought
out
your
better
nature
She
says
that
she
closed
the
door
that
she
did
not
do
any
kind
acts
in
life
so
her
spirit
body
was
all
crippled
because
of
her
bad
deeds
She
says
she
is
now
serving
and
when
she
does
a
good
act
some
of
her
crippled
condition
disappears

is
so
crippled

has
ragged
clothes
on

now
serving

body

earned
when

was
in

is
now
showing
me
the
body
she
has
earned
in

It
is
better
than
the
other
but
her
face
is
all
wrinkled
Dr
Her
face
was
her
pride

She
says
she
has
to
serve
and
help
every
one
she
wronged

she
must
do
good
acts
many
of

arrogant

disdainfully
about

Is
your

strange
to
you
What
has
happened
to
you
Spirit
Many
things
have
happened

not

Condescendingly

standing
It

be

Just
ask
those

told

say
they

Are
you

do
they
say

Some
nod
their
heads
Yes
some
do
not
answer

I
cannot
see
why
they
should
do

Most
of

answer
in

affirmative

see

Dr
King
Edward

Sp
They
used
to
say
he
was

wonderful

Everybody
respected

loved
him
He
was
very
much
for
everybody
He
mingled
with
the
common
herd
as
well
as
with
fine
society
Dr
That
is
a
good
suggestion
for
you
You
should
feel
more
at
home

the
common
herd
Do
you
remember

What
Great
War
Dr
Do

Coming

There

no

We
have
noble
blood

Dr
Suppose
a
commoner
were
made

King
would
that
change
his
blood
Do
you
remember
that
the
King
honored
Napoleon

gave
him
a
title
That
did
not

I
was

Were

My

seems
to

my
name
was
Esther

Were
you
the
Duchess

Sutherland
Sp
Indignantly
No
I
was
not
the
Duchess
but
one
of
the
distant
relatives
They
all
had
more
money
while
I
only
had
the
title
That
is
worth
a
great
deal

Do
you
see

Look
in

crowd
you
spoke

can
you
find
some
one

know

I
never
knew

Kitchener
had
passed
away

you
state
Dr
He
was
drowned
when
a
war
vessel
was
torpedoed
on
the
Scottish
Coast
Do
you
know
him
Sp
Yes
He
is
here
and
he
says
that
I
must
try
to
understand
my
situation
Dr
That
is
why
you
were
brought
here
Sp
Pointing
to
further
end
of
hall
Why
there
s
an
old
gentleman
spirit
lecturing
that
I
heard
many
years
ago
Just
fancy
I
never
thought
I
would
hear
him
again
He
is
talking
to
a
great
many
people
Spirits
It
seems
we
have
many
here
who
just
came
to
investigate
what
kind
of
a
meeting
this
is
and
what
is
going
on
They
all
seem
to
be
trying
very
hard
to
find
out
what
they
really
are
He
is
now
standing
on
that
platform
He
is
lecturing
just
as
he
used
to
in
England
some
years
ago
I
went
to
hear
him
but
he
talked
Spiritualism
I
did
not
really
know
what
he
meant
He
spoke
well
He
said
his
name
is
Dr
Peebles
Famous
lecturer
on
Spiritualism
He
said
to
me
You
go
in
there
so
I
came
He
says
I
want
you
to
get
understanding
and
I
do
not
no
no
what
does
he
mean
He
says
he
does
not
want
me
to
stay
in
the
earth
sphere
but
to
lift
my
soul
up
to
God
and
understand
the
real
spiritual
meaning
of
Him
He
has
a
big
crowd
around
him
some
he
is
trying
to
lift
up
to
higher
things
others
he
is
trying
to
wake
up
so
he
tells
me
They
are
not
sleeping
are
they
Dr
Yes
mentally
The
Bible
says
Blessed
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection
on
such
the
second
death
has
no
power
Sp
What
does
that
mean
Dr
It
means
that
for
those
who
have
a
spiritual
understanding
while
in
the
body
there
is
no
death
Sp
Of
course
there
is
Dr
No
one
ever
dies
The
spirit
or
mind
is
not
the
body
Sp
It
is
not
Dr
You
are
dead
to
the
world
and
your
own
relatives
and
evidently
have
been
so
for
many
years
but
we
know
that
you
yourself
are
not
really
dead
Sp
I
have
been
walking
about
a
great
deal
and
I
have
traveled
extensively
but
I
have
felt
very
strange
Whenever
I
wanted
to
go
anywhere
all
I
had
to
do
was
to
think
and
it
seemed
that
I
did
not
need
a
train
or
anything
but
I
was
there
At
times
I
felt
I
must
be
in
America
because
I
always
heard
they
run
their
trains
much
faster
than
in
England
Dr
You
are
in
Los
Angeles
California
Sp
California
How
did
I
get
here
The
old
gentleman
is
talking
to
a
big
crowd
He
says
he
has
to
bring
them
here
to
get
them
to
understand
and
to
have
them
open
their
spiritual
eyes
to
see
Dr
You
are
having
yours
opened
now
Sp
Why
should
I
come
here
and
speak
Why
do
the
rest
not
speak
The
lecturer
says
he
could
take
me
quicker
than
any
of
the
others
Still
I
do
not
look
different
than
they
He
says
he
could
take
me
more
quickly
to
control
a
psychic
Dr
He
is
right
Sp
What
does
he
mean
by
that
He
said
it
was
necessary
to
bring
this
crowd
here
He
met
most
of
them
in
England
when
he
was
lecturing
there
many
years
ago
He
says
some
will
listen
to
his
lecture
but
many
he
cannot
reach
nor
even
waken
so
he
brought
them
here
He
says
he
did
not
bring
me
here
to
waken
me
but
I
had
come
with
others
in
that
room
over
there
There
are
so
many
there
Some
are
crippled
and
some
cannot
speak
at
all
It
seems
as
if
he
speaks
and
lifts
them
up
and
then
they
waken
He
has
a
wonderful
power
for
healing
Dr
They
are
lifted
up
by
his
thought
He
makes
them
understand
that
their
crippled
bodies
are
in
the
grave
Sp
Now
he
says
that
I
must
thank
you
for
the
privilege
of
meeting
you
and
of
talking
with
you
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
do
that
He
says
also
that
I
shall
have
to
put
all
my
pride
aside
Yes
but
the
rest
are
the
same
as
I
Dr
You
might
see
Queen
Victoria
or
King
Edward
in
the
crowd
and
I
am
told
that
you
will
find
them
very
common
now
Sp
Of
Queen
Victoria
they
always
said
she
talked
to
spirits
and
everybody
thought
she
was
a
little
crazy
on
the
subject
Dr
She
was
open
minded
Sp
She
had
spirit
communications
very
often
Dr
She
is
not
a
Queen
any
longer
Sp
Some
said
she
had
a
medium
with
her
a
great
deal
to
ask
what
things
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
His
name
was
Brown
I
believe
Dr
Yes
John
Brown
Sp
She
said
she
always
had
to
ask
her
husband
about
things
Dr
What
more
does
Dr
Peebles
say
Sp
He
says
I
had
better
say
Good
Night
to
you
all
and
he
also
says
that
he
will
take
all
the
crowd
away
with
him
and
that
he
will
show
them
the
spirit
world
and
try
to
help
them
That
is
his
work
Dr
He
passed
out
about
Six
months
ago
Now
he
is
active
on
the
other
side
Sp
I
think
I
am
growing
weak
I
feel
strange
Dr
You
are
losing
control
This
body
is
not
yours
it
is
my
wife
s
Sp
What
do
you
mean
Dr
She
is
a
psychic
through
whom
you
are
talking
You
are
experiencing
only
a
temporary
sensation
Sp
There
is
my
mother

I
have
not
seen
her
for
many
years
Dr
How
does
she
look

Chap
Page

Lillian

Sp
She
looks
very
young
Dr
Ask
her
if
she
has
understanding
Sp
She
says
Yes
she
was
very
much
interested
in
Dr
Peebles
lectures
and
also
she
used
to
go
and
listen
to
Mrs
Britten
Dr
She
was
a
wonderful
woman
She
is
now
showing
object
lessons
in
spirit
life

Mother
says
she
used
to
go
and
hear
her
quite
often
and
also
some
man
who
lectured
Dr
Was
his
name
Mr
Wallis
Sp
Yes
He
was
quite
a
young
man
at
that
time

He
has
also
passed
on

all
pass
along

better
land

With
transfigured

beautiful
so
beautiful
On
the
altar
in
the
center
is
a
beautiful
statue
which
represents
Wisdom
There
is
a
statue
of
Truth
one
of
Love
one
of
Understanding
one
of
Honesty
one
of
Life
and
one
of
Modesty
Wisdom
is
the
center
statue
There
are
seven
statues
in
all
each
holding
a
light
each
one
of
the
seven
colors
Three
on
each
side
of
Wisdom
each
with
a
light
all
blending
into
Wisdom
the
beautiful
White
Light
Wisdom
Truth
Honesty
Love
Life
Understanding
Modesty
From
these
colors
come
the
seven
musical
notes
Each
note
corresponds
to
a
color
and
then
goes
toward
the
center
and
lends
into
Wisdom
There
the
real
truth
of
life
and
an
understanding
of
God
is
learned
Dr
The
Bible
says
God
is
Love
and
God
is
Spirit
and
they
that
worship
Him
must
worship
Him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
Sp
That
is
beautiful
See
those
colors
blend
They
go
on
and
on
blending
in
all
ways
into
all
forms
into
all
kinds
of
shapes
into
stars
and
flowers
and
then
they
become
music
Now
they
form
into
leaves
buds
and
flowers
music
taking
form
and
color
The
music
itself
I
never
heard
such
beautiful
music
Is
that
Heaven
Dr
You
may
call
it
Heaven
or
the
spirit
world
Heaven
is
a
condition
of
mind
The
Bible
says
Ye
are
the
temple
of
God
and
the
Spirit
of
God
dwelleth
in
you
God
is
Love
and
Wisdom
Sp
They
say
to
me
This
is
the
Gateway
to
the
Higher
Life
You
have
had
a
glimpse
of
it
but
you
cannot
be
there
Why
cannot
I
go
there
Dr
You
are
carrying
a
load
of
which
you
must
rid
yourself
your
pride
and
your
ignorance
of
spiritual
laws
Sp
There
is
one
who
says
We
have
to
learn
our
lessons
to
be
humble
to
be
charitable
to
serve
Learn
to
be
honest
and
sincere
then
you
can
enter
that
beautiful
hall
Take
up
the
cross
and
follow
me
That
cross
represents
the
crucifying
of
self
selfishness
jealousy
envy
bigotry
dogma
creeds
false
belief
and
pride
Take
up
your
cross
and
follow
me
That
means
that
I
must
crucify
self
learn
to
serve
learn
the
lesson
of
life
learn
to
love
others
better
than
myself
Selfishness
is
the
cause
of
all
trouble
Crucify
self
conceit
Oh
I
have
much
of
it
I
have
much
to
crucify
I
must
take
up
my
cross
and
learn
my
lesson
down
there
Pointing
downward
Dr
Jesus
said
Except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
Sp
With
meek
humility
and
a
beautiful
expression
of
resignation
hands
uplifted
Take
me
I
am
ready
to
serve
and
also
to
seek
for
truth
I
will
begin
here
and
now
to
do
the
will
of
Heaven
Whatever
is
the
will
of
God
find
me
there
doing
it
I
must
not
go
to
church
to
find
God
I
must
find
Him
within
if
I
wish
the
opening
of
the
door
to
that
beautiful
Hall
of
Understanding
Wisdom
and
Glory
Now
I
have
to
start
at
the
bottom
at
the
very
bottom
to
serve
Is
that
to
be
my
mission
Is
it
Dr
Yes
every
one
must
serve
Sp
Amongst
all
those
crippled
and
blind
people
I
am
to
show
them
the
way
The
door
was
opened
for
me
to
have
a
glimpse
of
what
I
am
to
work
for
but
it
was
closed
again
and
I
I
have
to
serve
I
have
never
served
It
will
be
very
hard
for
I
have
always
been
waited
on
I
have
never
had
to
dress
myself
or
comb
my
hair
I
never
have
done
it
in
all
my
life
never
Now
I
have
to
serve
and
comb
the
matted
hair
of
those
cripples
down
there
I
but
I
have
to
do
it
Dr
Jesus
said
My
yoke
is
easy
and
my
burden
is
light
Sp
Earnestly
It
is
worth
it
to
gain
that
crown
of
wisdom
It
is
worth
all
I
must
go
through
with
to
enter
that
beautiful
hall
and
listen
to
the
wonders
there
I
will
serve
yes
I
honestly
will
I
will
do
that
and
more
for
all
God
help
me
in
my
great
struggle
Yes
I
promise
I
will
serve
and
do
all
within
my
power
I
must
go
Good
Night
CHAPTER
XIII
Orthodoxy
THE
science
of
religion
should
teach
an
intelligent
realization
of
the
nature
of
God
and
the
life
hereafter
but
humanity
is
still
kept
in
subjection
by
fear
superstition
dogmas
and
creeds
and
has
not
yet
attained
liberation
through
a
full
understanding
of
what
becomes
of
the
dead
Passing
through
the
change
called
death
a
great
majority
remain
in
entire
ignorance
of
their
condition
and
are
bound
for
a
time
to
the
earth
plane
by
their
false
doctrines
These
cling
to
their
orthodox
ideas
often
influencing
those
still
in
the
body
and
the
mental
derangements
which
frequently
follow
in
the
train
of
revivals
are
examples
of
these
obsessions
as
are
the
phenomena
known
as
The
Gift
of
Tongues
and
Seizure
by
The
Power
which
accompany
many
revivals
Religious
exhortations
readily
lead
to
mental
aberrations
since
invisible
religious
fanatics
are
always
present
who
are
unconscious
of
their
transition
and
having
found
no
higher
life
retain
their
mortal
bigotry
and
by
their
presence
add
to
the
insane
fervor
These
spirits
often
make
themselves
audible
to
excited
sensitives
for
at
such
gatherings
many
are
encouraged
to
listen
to
the
still
small
voice
supposedly
of
God
During
religious
excitement
the
psychic
faculty
is
highly
sensitized
giving
mischievous
spirits
as
well
as
fanatical
spirits
the
proper
opportunity
to
impress
credulous
persons
with
their
whisperings
Such
entities
for
their
own
deceptive
purposes
may
pretend
to
be
angels
the
Holy
Ghost
or
The
Spirit
of
God
and
the
thoughtless
victims
elated
and
unwilling
to
listen
to
reason
heed
these
whisperings
which
so
frequently
lead
to
obsession
and
possession
resulting
in
madness
insanity
and
other
psychoses
The
most
difficult
to
enlighten
of
the
earthbound
spirits
are
the
religious
fanatics
Dominated
in
earth
life
by
one
narrow
fixed
idea
opposed
to
logical
analysis
and
independent
thinking
they
are
found
after
passing
out
of
the
physical
in
a
state
of
self
hypnosis
ceaselessly
repeating
their
empty
religious
jargon
Nothing
exists
for
them
but
their
dogmatic
creed
they
are
adamantly
set
in
their
self
assurance
and
it
is
often
many
years
before
they
can
be
brought
to
a
semblance
of
sanity

The

who
assumed
control
of

tonight
was
vigorously
singing
a
religious
hymn
Doctor
Have
you
been
here
before
Spirit
Let

sing
some
more
Dr
We
are
going

Sp
I

better

another
song
Dr
If
we
did
you
might
become
too
enthusiastic
Sp
We
are

church

you
know
you

sing
Sing
Hallelujah
Tell

story
Dr
We

You

You

Let

in
Jesus

That

Let

pray
to
the
Lord
Hallelujah
Jesus
Christ
Dr
Now

that
is

What

Let

Dr
You

Tell

Sp
What
church

Dr
Be

go
How
long
have
you
been
dead
You
know
something
happened
to
you
You
have
been
hovering
around
the
earth
probably
for
years
and

never
gotten
anywhere
Be
sensible
Sp
I

You

religiously
insane

We
all
pray
to
God
and
the
Holy
Ghost
Loudly
Hallelujah

We
do
not

that
shouting
Sp
I
am
doing
work

We

such

before

Not

t
I
am
working

Lord

Dr
This

Are

Listen

Whoever

Sp
What
church

this
Dr
It

no

Sp
I
am
glad
of
that

I
thought
the
church
must
surely
have
changed
Let
me
talk
in
Jesus
name
Dr
You
have
been
brought
here
by
kind
spirits
so
that
you
can
understand
your
condition
You
are
a

and
probably
have
been
for
a
long
time
You
will
not
listen
to
any
one
who
tries
to
enlighten
you
Sp
Go
ahead
then
and
say
what
you
have
to
say
Then
I
can
talk
too
Dr
Understand
your

You

temporarily

Some
friend
brought
you
here
for
help
Do
you

something
happened
to
you
Sp
No
Dr
You
would
if
you
were
honest
You
know
that
you
are
in
a
strange
condition
You
are
not
honest
enough
to

any
attention
to
it
Do
you
know
that
you
are

Los
Angeles
California
Sp
How
did
I
get
there
I
suppose
I
sang
and
prayed
as
a
missionary
A
missionary
must
have
taken
me
away
Dr
You
were
brought
here

you
are
an
ignorant
spirit
What
did
your
mother
call
you
Sp
I
don
t
know
just
now
I
can
t
think
Dr
You

Ignorant

church
I
went
out
sewing
in
a
shop
but
my
Mamma
took
me
to
church
every
night
All
I
got
was
a
hard
crust
of
bread
and
some
water
in
Jesus
name
Dr
How
old
are
you
Sp
About
sixteen
or
seventeen
Dr
What
kind
of
a
shop
did
you
work
in
Sp
I
sewed
overalls
Dr
In
Chicago
Sp
No
but
we
were
in
a
big
town
I
can
t
remember
That
minister
preached
and
preached
Dr
That
is
all
over
now
Sp
Sometimes
I
asked
Mamma
why
we
had
to
sing
and
pray
all
the
time
It
came
to
my
heart
that
God
is
Love
and
we
are
His
children
so
why
does
He
let
us
work
so
hard
and
sacrifice
our
bodies
so
that
we
hardly
have
any
strength
then
give
all
our
money
to
Him
Is
He
so
poor
Dr
The
Lord
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
that
Only
ignorant
insane
persons
say
such
things
Sp
He
is
a
minister
Dr
What
church
did
you
belong
to
Sp
The
minister
said
if
we
did
not
do
as
he
told
us
to
we
would
go
to
hell
He
talks
and
talks
and
we
have
to
listen
to
him
I
don
t
know
why
but
I
haven
t
sewed
since
I
was
in
that
fire
It
seems
like
a
fire
and
an
earthquake
I
felt
so
bad
because
I
choked
and
coughed
My
Mamma
and
I
have
not
had
any
house
to
sleep
in
The
minister
told
us
we
could
sleep
most
anywhere
but
if
we
worked
and
gave
all
our
money
to
the
Lord
we
would
be
all
right
Sometimes
I
wanted
a
new
dress
awful
bad
I
didn
t
earn
so
very
much
money
but
if
I
could
have
kept
it
I
could
have
got
a
new
dress
sometime
Mamma
took
it
all
She
said
Mary
Ann
you
must
sacrifice
for
the
Lord
Sometimes
I
said
I
may
go
to
hell
for
it
but
I
think
it
would
be
better
to
go
to
hell
than
to
hear
about
the
Lord
all
the
time
I
don
t
know
if
it
would
be
better
but
I
thought
it
would
be
Dr
All
that
fanaticism
is
wrong
every
bit
of
it
God
is
Spirit
and
God
is
Love
God
has
nothing
to
do
with
such
fanatical
talk
He
does
not
need
any
one
s
money
Sp
Then
why
do
they
give
it
to
Him
Dr
God
doesn
t
get
it
the
ministers
do
God
doesn
t
need
it
Sp
Doesn
t
God
need
our
money
Dr
No
God
is
Spirit
Spirit
is
invisible
I
am
talking
to
you
and
you
are
talking
to
me
but
you
are
invisible
to
us
We
cannot
see
you
Mind
is
invisible
You
see
my
body
but
not
my
mind
God
is
invisible
and
He
is
not
in
a
certain
place
as
we
are
He
is
the
Soul
of
all
things
Sp
But
the
minister
says
He
sits
on
a
throne
with
Jesus
on
His
right
hand
Why
did
he
tell
us
that
if
it
is
not
true
Dr
Because
the
truth
is
not
in
him
He
is
not
honest
Sp
But
Jesus
died
for
our
sins
Dr
No
he
did
not
Sp
He
said
Take
up
my
cross
and
follow
me
and
go
to
church
every
day
Dr
Jesus
never
mentioned
going
to
church
His
teachings
were
about
the
higher
life
Sp
Heaven
Dr
Not
as
you
understand
it
Heaven
is
a
happy
mental
condition
If
you
could
have
had
a
new
dress
as
you
wished
you
would
have
been
happy
wouldn
t
you
Sp
Yes
I
should
like
to
have
a
new
dress
I
don
t
care
so
very
much
for
fancy
things
Once
in
a
while
I
wanted
a
nice
new
dress
and
not
what
the
minister
told
us
we
should
have
But
we
had
to
give
our
money
to
the
Lord
Dr
No
you
didn
t
You
gave
it
to
the
minister
Sp
He
gave
us
some
old
dresses
that
had
been
given
to
the
church
and
my
Mamma
said
we
must
sacrifice
When
I
kicked
Mamma
said
You
will
go
to
hell
if
you
don
t
do
what
the
Lord
says
you
should
do
Dr
There
is
no
such
place
as
hell
Sp
No
hell
Dr
Of
course
not
Sp
Isn
t
hell
a
burning
fire
I
have
seen
it
burning
and
I
see
it
yet
Dr
Possibly
your
mother
in
her
religious
insanity
set
fire
to
the
house
Sp
No
I
don
t
think
so
It
seems
like
there
was
an
earthquake
and
then
after
that
there
was
the
fire
Dr
Who
is
President
Sp
I
don
t
know
I
ll
tell
you
I
didn
t
have
so
very
much
school
I
went
to
work
when
I
was
nine
years
old
Dr
Did
you
have
a
father
Sp
I
did
not
know
my
father
Dr
Your
schooling
does
not
make
any
difference
You
have
lost
your
physical
body
and
are
now
a
spirit
Sp
I
lost
my
physical
body
But
I
have
a
body
Dr
This
is
not
your
body
it
belongs
to
my
wife
Sp
Where
did
I
get
these
clothes
from
Dr
They
belong
to
my
wife
Sp
But
I
should
like
to
have
my
own
clothes
Dr
You
will
have
your
own
soon
Sp
I
do
not
like
to
take
them
from
your
wife
I
am
sorry
but
I
must
not
wear
them
Dr
Look
at
your
shoes
Sp
I
must
be
in
Heaven
Dr
You
feel
better
do
you
not
than
when
you
were
praying
all
the
time
Sp
I
feel
strong
Did
I
get
something
to
eat
because
I
feel
so
strong
Dr
You
are
controlling
a
healthy
body
This
is
my
wife
s
body
Sp
I
don
t
like
to
have
your
wife
s
body
Dr
You
will
only
stay
here
for
a
short
time
Sp
Then
where
will
I
go
I
won
t
have
to
go
back
to
that
minister
and
hear
all
those
crazy
people
sing
all
the
time
will
I
When
the
minister
talked
about
hell
and
damnation
I
saw
a
big
fire
and
I
saw
the
devil
with
his
pitchfork
and
he
pushed
people
in
Dr
When
that
minister
was
preaching
he
was
thinking
of
hell
fire
and
made
a
picture
which
the
rest
of
you
saw
and
it
appeared
like
a
reality
But
it
was
only
a
phantasm
which
he
created
Sp
He
scared
us
with
it
Dr
As
he
talked
it
would
appear
to
you
as
a
reality
Sp
But
it
looked
like
real
I
suppose
they
have
those
things
in
hell
but
I
want
to
go
to
Heaven
Dr
Your
mother
and
the
minister
are
spirits
but
ignorant
of
the
fact
Sp
Do
you
mean
all
those
people
are
spirits
There
must
be
a
thousand
all
singing
and
praying
all
the
time
Sometimes
we
got
just
bread
and
water
and
we
lay
down
on
boards
We
must
be
there
all
the
time
otherwise
the
minister
is
not
pleased
with
us
and
he
says
if
we
do
not
get
down
on
our
knees
we
go
into
the
fire
Dr
That
is
all
nonsense
All
those
people
have
lost
their
physical
bodies
and
are
in
the
outer
darkness
that
the
Bible
speaks
about
They
are
in
blind
religious
ignorance
They
will
remain
in
that
condition
for
a
very
long
time
if
they
do
not
change
their
way
of
thinking
They
are
filled
with
religious
fanaticism
Your
mother
was
brought
here
for
understanding
and
controlled
this
same
body
Sp
Someone
pushed
her
in
and
then
I
could
not
talk
to
her
any
more
The
whole
crowd
down
there
will
not
listen
to
any
body
they
just
sing
and
pray
Dr
They
can
stay
there
for
years
and
years
and
their
Lord
will
not
care
anything
about
them
Sp
There
that
hell
is
not
there
any
more
Dr
The
minister
thinks
of
hell
and
devils
and
creates
phantasms
which
seem
real
to
ignorant
spirits
Sp
Will
you
help
my
mother
Dr
Intelligent
spirits
will
take
care
of
her
It
was
they
who
pushed
her
in
here
to
bring
her
to
an
understanding
The
difference
between
you
and
your
mother
is
that
you
will
listen
and
she
would
not
Sp
Then
you
do
not
think
God
would
be
angry
with
me
I
Dr
Of
course
not
Sp
Sure
Dr
God
knows
everything
He
is
All
in
All
He
is
the
Creator
and
Creation
both
Sp
Don
t
we
fall
in
sin
Dr
No
never
If
you
say
we
fall
in
sin
you
say
God
made
a
mistake
when
He
created
us
He
is
All
Wise
All
Powerful
and
everywhere
present
When
such
a
God
as
that
created
the
world
and
mankind
He
did
not
make
a
mistake
allowing
man
to
fall
in
sin
Otherwise
He
would
not
be
All
Wise
Sp
Why
do
they
say
that
then
Dr
People
worship
creed
The
truth
is
given
allegorically
in
the
Bible
Sp
Didn
t
Jesus
die
for
our
sins
Dr
Of
course
he
did
not
Sp
The
minister
said
there
is
power
in
the
blood
Dr
No
there
is
not
Some
of
those
people
you
speak
of
have
probably
been
dead
a
long
time
We
cannot
see
them
Sp
Can
t
you
see
all
those
people
over
there
Pointing
Dr
No
they
are
spirits
and
have
lost
their
bodies
long
ago
They
are
blind
to
the
higher
life
You
are
not
satisfied
to
be
with
them
and
you
ask
questions
therefore
we
can
help
you
to
an
understanding
We
must
add
understanding
to
our
faith
You
lost
your
own
body
perhaps
many
years
ago
Sp
Everything
was
all
mixed
up
I
got
hurt
in
the
head
Dr
Don
t
you
remember
any
of
the
streets
in
your
city
SP
No
I
can
t
remember
It
seems
like
I
was
in
San
Francisco
Ques
By
a
former
resident
of
San
Francisco
Did
you
go
across
the
Bay
to
Oakland
Sp
Yes
and
we
went
to
Oakland
to
the
prayer
meeting
Ques
Did
you
work
at
Strauss
Brothers
Overall
Factory
Was
it

I
remember
now
We
lived
on
Mission

Near
Daly
toward
Golden
Gate
Park

No
it
was
near
the
depot
Ques
Toward
the
Ferry
Sp
Near
the
Southern
Pacific
Station
They
had
a
Mission
House
on
Mission
Street
Ques
Was
that
toward
the
Bay
Sp
I
don
t
know
We
lived
in
a
little
house
we
rented
My
mother
went
to
the
factory
too
but
she
got
sick
because
she
sang
and
prayed
all
the
time
I
had
to
do
her
work
too
We
did
not
get
much
just
kept
enough
so
we
could
live
The
minister
said
it
was
a
sin
to
eat
meat
or
milk
or
butter
or
eggs
He
said
they
cost
too
much
and
that
we
must
sacrifice
our
bodies
Dr
Was
your
father
dead
Sp
I
think
he
died
when
I
was
a
little
girl
I
don
t
really
know
Dr
Look
around
and
see
whether
there
is
anyone
here
whom
you
know
Other
spirits
are
here
who
will
help
you
and
take
you
to
the
spirit
world
That
is
the
invisible
world
around
the
physical
world

I
see
such
a
pretty
garden
Look
at
those
beautiful
flowers
just
look
at
them
I
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
There
s
trees
and
flowers
Hear
the
pretty
birds
how
they
sing
Look
at
that
beautiful
lake
and
all
the
children
swinging
on
the
shore
Dr
That
is
the
spirit
world
Sp
It
is
so
much
better
than
over
there
where
they
sing
and
pray
Sometimes
I
was
so
hungry
that
nothing
satisfied
me
Isn
t
this
different
from
those
crazy
singing
people
Can
t
you
see
them
all
Couldn
t
you
help
them
to
see
this
beautiful
place
Dr
Your
mother
was
here
controlling
this
body
but
we
could
do
nothing
with
her
Sp
Oh
look
at
that
nice
little
house
over
there
It
has
two
rooms
and
a
beautiful
garden
full
of
flowers
Dr
Do
you
see
any
one
around
there
Sp
Somebody
says
my
grandmother
lives
there
and
it
s
going
to
be
my
home
too
They
say
she
is
waiting
for
me
I
only
know
grandmother
a
little
She
visited
us
once
but
she
could
not
stay
because
Mamma
was
carrying
on
so
and
grandmother
didn
t
believe
in
it
So
she
went
far
away
I
think
East
somewhere
and
after
that
she
died
Mamma
got
some
money
from
grandma
I
don
t
know
just
how
much
but
I
think
she
said
a
little
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
I
thought
then
I
should
get
a
new
dress
but
the
Lord
got
it
all
The
minister
said
the
next
Sunday
that
she
would
go
up
into
the
Seventh
Heaven
because
she
gave
the
Lord
all
that
money
She
would
not
eat
one
thing
all
that
day
I
thought
sure
I
would
get
a
new
dress
but
I
didn
t
Can
you
hear
that
beautiful
music
Listen
Dr
We
cannot
hear
it
Sp
I
never
heard
anything
so
fine
All
the
flowers
bow
to
the
music
and
when
they
hear
it
they
look
happy
The
music
seems
like
colors
and
it
seems
to
go
with
the
flowers
When
the
music
changes
the
flowers
have
a
different
color
Dr
You
will
find
many
beautiful
things
when
you
leave
here
Sp
There
is
a
gentleman
standing
there
and
he
looks
at
me
and
says
Come
little
child
We
are
many
because
each
mother
had
her
children
that
she
took
to
church
with
her
One
time
I
ll
tell
you
There
was
I
and
Bertha
and
Clara
and
Joe
Joe
s
a
boy
we
all
went
into
a
corner
and
we
just
sat
there
and
talked
The
minister
saw
us
and
you
don
t
know
how
mad
he
was
He
said
he
would
have
to
punish
us
all
and
he
did
He
said
The
Lord
will
punish
you
all
but
the
minister
did
it
and
his
hand
was
awful
hard
My
grandmother
is
here
and
she
says
Mary
Ann
you
can
come
with
me
and
we
will
try
all
we
can
to
help
your
mother
This
gentleman
who
stands
there
says
he
is
my
father
Grandma
was
my
father
s
mother
Grandma
says
he
died
East
Mother
joined
the
Salvation
Army
but
the
Mission
Friends
got
hold
of
her
We
came
from
Kansas
when
I
was
a
little
girl
The
money
my
grandma
sent
was
to
be
given
to
me
but
my
mother
said
we
would
put
it
in
the
Lord
s
keeping
So
the
Lord
kept
it
and
I
didn
t
get
any
new
dress
Dr
The
Lord
did
not
get
that
money
either
Sp
Whether
he
got
it
or
not
makes
no
difference
now
I
will
get
my
new
dress
I
have
one
but
that
is
not
mine
because
you
say
this
is
not
my
body
I
will
have
a
new
dress
but
I
don
t
want
sackcloth
I
must
not
say
that
it
isn
t
nice
Dr
Now
you
are
going
to
serve
others
and
be
where
there
are
trees
and
flowers
and
beautiful
music
Sp
This
gentleman
comes
he
says
he
is
my
father
but
I
don
t
remember
him
He
says
he
will
help
me
You
know
my
father
died
or
passed
out
Sometimes
people
say
that
Dr
Passed
out
is
right
There
is
no
actual
death
nobody
ever
dies
Your
father
only
lost
his
body
Sp
Isn
t
that
dead
Dr
His
mind
or
spirit
being
invisible
while
in
the
body
is
still
invisible
to
mortals
when
he
steps
out
of
his
body
His
body
is
only
the
house
where
his
spirit
lives
and
when
the
spirit
leaves
the
body
the
body
is
placed
in
the
grave
But
the
spirit
is
not
dead
Sp
Sometimes
I
prayed
for
my
father
because
mother
said
he
went
to
hell
Father
says
there
is
no
such
place
He
looks
awful
nice
and
he
s
all
dressed
up
I
wish
my
mother
would
understand
Dr
Don
t
worry
about
your
mother
After
spirits
like
she
control
this
body
they
are
placed
in
a
spirit
hospital
Sp
Can
you
talk
to
the
Lord
too
I
wish
you
would
talk
to
Him
because
He
takes
too
much
money
from
the
poor
Dr
The
Lord
does
not
do

it
is

Why
here
comes
a
little
Indian
girl
Spirit
Dr
Isn
t
she
nice
She
will
show
you
beautiful
things
Sp
Can
I
go
with
her
What
is
her
name
Dr
Silver
Star
Sp
Is
that
her
name
Will
you
play
with
me
little
girl
and
can
I
play
with
you
She
says
yes
and
that
she
will
takeme
to
her
home
and
show
me
pretty
things
Won
t
I
be
happy
I
will
have
a
new
dress
not
this
sackcloth
but
probably
the
Lord
would
not
like
that
Dr
Forget
all
about
that
Go
with
the
intelligent
spirits
and
they
will
help
you
and
teach
you
Sp
Silver
Star
says
I
should
come
with
her
and
she
will
take
me
to
my
grandmother
and
my
father
and
my
brother
Surprised
Oh
my
brother
I
forgot
all
about
Lawrence
He
was
so
little
when
he
died
Dr
How
old
was
he
Sp
I
don
t
know
He
was
only
a
little
baby
I
don
t
know
much
because
I
couldn
t
go
to
school
when
I
wanted
to
I
had
to
work
for
the
Lord
Dr
After
you
leave
here
you
will
learn
many
things
Sp
But
my
mother
said
the
Lord
did
not
want
us
to
learn
because
we
must
sacrifice
everything
If
you
read
and
write
you
get
away
from
the
Lord
Dr
Just
remember
I
said
that
was
all
wrong
teaching
Sp
I
will
find
it
out
and
I
will
find
out
if
the
Lord
gets
all
the
money
If
that
minister
took
all
that
money
I
will
tell
him
he
is
not
nice
Dr
You
will
find
that
belief
about
the
Lord
is
not
true
Sp
And
I
thought
it
was
gospel
truth
They
would
not
let
me
go
to
school
I
saw
lots
of
children
learn
but
I
could
not
They
said
I
would
not
go
to
Heaven
if
I
learned
I
cried
when
I
could
not
have
a
new
dress
and
the
minister
told
me
I
would
go
to
hell
Dr
Now
you
will
learn
the
truth
You
have
been
dead
probably
many
years
Have
you
seen
Heaven
Why
are
you
not
there
Sp
That
s
true
Dr
The
Bible
mentions
the
outer
darkness
you
were
in
darkness
but
it
was
all
of
your
own
making
Sp
How
can
they
sing
and
pray
all
the
time
when
they
are
dead
These
people
have
churches
Once
in
a
while
they
go
to
other
churches
on
earth
when
God
wants
them
in
some
other
church
Sometimes
before
the
minister
mortal
knows
it
the
people
in
the
church
do
something
like
that
swaying
motion
of
the
body
and
every
one
gets
up
and
jumps
and
sings
The
mortals
having
opened
themselves
through
wild
emotionalism
to
spirit
obsession
Their
minister
says
that
is
the
influence
of
the
Holy
Ghost
Some
of
our
crowd
get
into
that
other
crowd
and
make
them
all
jump
Dr
Spirits
such
as
you
speak
of
often
go
to
churches
on
the
physical
side
and
unbalance
the
people
making
them
demented
Then
the
people
say
they
are
controlled
by
the
Holy
Ghost
Sp
Silver
Star
says
she
will
take
me
along
and
that
I
will
have
a
new
dress
Maybe
it
is
not
right
but
it
feels
good
to
know
I
will
have
one
Silver
Star
says
that
I
must
thank
all
of
you
for
being
patient
with
me
Some
day
I
will
come
and
tell
you
how
I
like
things
and
then
probably
I
can
remember
more
If
you
do
not
come
there
then
I
will
come
to
see
you
Mary
Ann
McDonald

will
see

I
feel
like
saying
God
bless
you

I

I
shouldn

Dr
That
is
all
right
Now
go
with
Silver
Star

All
right
Goodbye
That
conscientious

attendance
faithful

Wake
up
Spirit
I

Dr
Why
are
you
bent
over
Sp
My
back
is
broken
Dr
You
are
mistaken
it
is
not
broken
Sp
Oh
yes
it
is
Dr
It
may
have
been
broken
but
it
is
not
now
Sp
I
tell
you
I
cannot
straighten
up
my
back
is
broken
Dr
We
can
change
that
condition
Sp
Many
times
they
told
me
that
but
they
never
could
Dr
But
we
are
going
to
do
it
for
you
this
time

I
will
give
you
ten
dollars

you
can
straighten

out
Dr
Where
is
the
money
Sp
When
I
can
stand
up
I
will
give
it
to
you
If
you
can
cure
me
it
is
worth
all
of
ten

Just
think
I
can
walk

you
will
be
able
to
walk
Sp
You
will
have
to
show
me
Dr
Move
your
legs

you
can
walk

I
did
that
many
times

it
never
helped
Dr
Nevertheless
you
can
be
cured
Sp
But
I
have
no
money
I
haven
t
had
money
for
some
time
Every
time
I
see
money
I
grab
it
but
it
gets
away
just
like
it
had
life
Dr
I
will
explain
Do
you
know
that
you
are
a

Do
you
know
you
are
dead
yes
dead
to
the

Sp
Then
I
don
t
know
it
and
I
haven

been
in
Heaven
I
was
a
good
Methodist
I
went
to
church
every
Sunday
and
also
to
Sunday
School
I
prayed
and
prayed
that
I
might

I
was

Where

Down

Texas
Dr
What

your
name
Sp
My
name
is
Henry
Wilkins
Dr
How
old
are
you
Sp
I
am
an
old
man
in
the
sixties
One
time
I
was
driving
a
horse
and
he
ran
away
I
fell
off
the
wagon
and
broke
my
back
I
used
to
be
a
farmer
After
that
I
could
do
no
farming
At
that
time
I
was
in
the
thirties
After
I
was
hurt
all
I
could
do
was
some
cobbling
I
earned
my
living
but
it
was
surely
hard
sometimes
Dr
Have
you
any
idea
what
year
it
is

I
can
t
remember
Dr
Who
was
President

Let
me
think
a
little
I
ought
to
know
that
I
think
if
I
remember
right
it
was
Cleveland
Dr
What
was
the
cause
of
your
death
Sp
I
did
not
die
I
did
some
work
but
I
never
got
any
money
for
it
because
as
soon
as
I
was
going
to
take
the
money
somebody
else
grabbed
it
I
heard
many
times
that
my
shop
belonged
to
somebody
else
I
have
been
working
there
a
long
time
but
the
young
fellow
there
he
always
takes
the
money
all
the
time
and
I
never
get
anything
Dr
Did
you
start
the
shop
Sp
Yes
many
years
ago
Some
young
fellow
came
to
my
shop
and
helped
with
the
work
but
I
had
to
show
him
how
to
do
it
and
I
had
to
teach
him
how
to
do
lots
of
things
He
got
all
the
money
I
never
got
a
smell
of
it
Dr
The
fact
is
my
friend
you
have
passed
out
and
are
so
called
dead
Sp
I
have
done
nothing
for
some
time
except
help
that
young
fellow
get
rich
Dr
Now
listen
to
me
You
lost
your
physical
body
probably
while
you
had
that
shop
and
now
the
shop
belongs
to
somebody
else
The
young
man
did
not
know
you
were
there
but
you
may
have
impressed
him
how
to
do
things
He
did
not
know
you
were
there
Sp
He
did
not
know
because
I
did
the
work
I
sat
there
working
and
once
in
a
while
he
would
sit
right
on
me
I
could
not
chase
him
out
Dr
Do
you
know
what
year
it

It

That
was
thirty
years

you

You

Los

Look

Who
put

clothes

Let
me

Bring
my
pants

Look

these

They
do

I
never
owned
a
ring
Dr
Suppose
you
sat
here
mending
shoes
Do
you
know
what
people
would
say
They
would
say
Why
is
Mrs
Wickland
sitting
there
mending
shoes
Mrs
Wickland
is
my
wife
and
you
are
using
her
body
Sp
I
am
no
woman
I
am
a
man
I
was
engaged
to
be
married
but
when
I
had
my
accident
and
became
a
cripple
the
girl
said
she
did
not
want
to
marry
a
cripple
so
she
married
some
one
else
I
told
her
I
could
earn
just
as
much
money
by
mending
shoes
as
I
did
when
a
farmer
but
she
said
she
would
not
marry
a
cripple
I
loved
her
just
the
same
and
I
love
her
still
Dr
What
was
her
name
Sp
Mary
Hopkins
She
said
she
was
ashamed
of
me
I
could
not
help
my
accident
I
felt
that
if
she
loved
me
she
would
have
thought
more
of
me
because
I
needed
her
more
Of
course
I
did
not
look
so
nice
I
could
not
dance
and
do
the
things
she
wanted
to
do
One
day
she
said
to
me
I
am
ashamed
to
go
out
with
you
all
crippled
up
I
felt
so
bad
because
I
did
not
think
she
could
be
so
cruel
I
suffered
terribly
It
was
not
enough
that
I
had
a
crippled
body
but
my
heart
was
broken
as
well
From
that
time
I
said
Women
are
all
devils
I
had
no
use
for
them
I
hated
them
Dr
There
are
many
good
women
Sp
Sometimes
I
felt
there
is
no
God
because
He
would
not
have
let
me
suffer
such
mental
and
physical
pain
I
tried
my
very
best
to
be
patient
Dr
You
will
have
your
reward
for
it
now
Sp
I
gave
money
to
the
church
They
said
I
must
give
money
because
God
needed
it
Sometimes
they
made
me
give
so
much
that
I
hadn
t
enough
left
for
bread
and
butter
They
said
if
I
didn
t
I
wouldn
t
go
to
Heaven
Dr
There
is
no
such
Heaven
as
the
preachers
teach
Sp
Then
why
should
they
preach
that
way
Dr
For
a
living
Do
you
realize
that
the
teachings
of
Jesus
were
wonderful
God
is
Spirit
Jesus
said
and
we
should
worship
Him
in
Spirit
and
in
truth
The
orthodox
Christians
think
Heaven
is
a
place
up
in
the
sky
Heaven
is
a
mental
condition
not
a
visible
place
The
fact
is
we
are
spiritual
beings
invisible
while
occupying
the
mortal
body
When
we
step
out
of
the
mortal
body
we
are
still
spiritual
beings
and
if
we
are
free
minded
those
gone
before
will
meet
us
and
will
show
us
the
way
to
the
spirit
world
God
is
not
a
visible
spirit
but
God
is
Spirit
God
is
Love
You
say
you
loved
a
girl
Did
you
ever
see
love
Sp
No
but
I
have
felt
it
Dr
He
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
God
We
are
talking
to
you
but
we
do
not
see
you
I
do
not
see
you
I
see
only
the
face
of
my
wife
Sp
I
don
t
see
why
you
keep
calling
me
your
wife
You
say
we
never
die
yet
you
tell
me
I
am
dead
and
I
still
have
my
crippled
body
Dr
If
you
had
had
understanding
you
would
not
have
been
crippled
all
these
years
since
your
death
Sp
Could
I
have
been
well
all
these
years
Dr
Yes
if
you
had
been
taught
the
truth
Jesus
said
The
people
honoreth
me
with
their
lips
but
their
heart
is
far
from
me
Sp
People
believe
that
Jesus
died
for
our
sins
and
that
if
we
are
good
we
will
go
to
Heaven
when
we
die
I
am
not
there
Dr
You
will
never
go
to
any
orthodox
Heaven
And
if
there
were
such
a
place
you
would
be
lonesome
after
you
arrived
there
Heaven
is
a
mental
condition
attained
through
understanding
Think
of
the
wonders
of
Nature
and
God
s
revelations
Do
you
like
music
Sp
I
used
to
I
used
to
sing
in
the
choir
My
girl
sang
too
We
were
so
happy
I
always
felt
when
we
were
singing
there
was
such
beautiful
harmony
but
then
the
minister
got
up
in
church
and
condemned
everybody
that
did
not
give
enough
money
to
the
church
He
said
we
would
go
straight
to
hell
I
could
never
see
the
justice
of
that
that
when
a
man
does
the
best
he
knows
how
and
lives
a
clean
life
that
he
should
go
to
hell
if
he
does
not
give
enough
money
to
the
church
Dr
Do
you
know
who
was
the
founder
of
the
Methodist
Church
John
Wesley
He
understood
the
real
life
on
the
other
side
and
lectured
on
spirits
and
spirit
communion
He
knew
the
truth
he
did
not
just
believe
and
he
wrote
of
it
but
his
people
do
not
follow
the
teachings
of
the
founder
of
their
own
church
Christians
do
not
understand
the
teachings
of
Jesus
They
do
not
want
to
understand
because
that
causes
them
to
think
It
is
easier
to
merely
believe
Spiritual
things
must
be
spiritually
discerned
Sp
When
I
was
in
my
shop
once
in
a
while
I
saw
my
father
and
mother
but
they
are
dead
and
I
knew
I
could
not
be
with
them
Dr
Why
not
Sp
Because
I
was
in
life
cobbling
in
my
shop
Mother
said
to
me
Come
along
with
me
I
could
not
go
because
I
had
my
crippled
body
and
I
had
to
earn
my
living
When
I
did
not
work
I
did
not
get
anything
to
eat
and
I
was
awfully
hungry
Once
in
a
while
I
got
a
smell
from
the
restaurant
but
that
was
all
unless
I
worked
Dr
You
were
a
spirit
so
could
not
eat
Your
parents
came
to
you
because
they
are
spirits
All
these
years
you
stayed
around
your
shop
because
that
was
your
greatest
interest
You
did
not
know
the
higher
laws
of
life
Sp
I
was
taught
that
if
I
did
not
go
to
church
I
would
go
to
hell
and
burn
for
ever
and
ever
Dr
There
is
no
such
thing
as
burning
for
ever
Sp
Thank
God
for
that
Dr
Look
around
perhaps
you
will
see
somebody
you
know
Sp
I
am
sick
and
tired
of
mending
shoes
Dr
After
you
leave
here
you
will
not
have
to
mend
any
more
shoes
Sp
I
would
like
to
play
and
sing
I
love
music
I
was
getting
along
very
nicely
with
my
singing
lessons
until
I
got
crippled
Dr
Perhaps
Mary
is
here
now
Sp
Mary
She
gave
me
up
and
married

she
was
not
happy
She
married
a
drunkard
She
suffered

Oh

She
says
My

you
need
not
be
crippled
any
longer
Why
I
have
a
new

Mother
but
oh
Mother
crying
I
am

Such
a
foolish
thing
to

up

You
are
only
talking
through
my
wife

body
Sp
Can
I
talk
through
another
person
s
body
Dr
Yes
My
wife
is
a
psychic
instrument
through
whom
spirits
can
talk
She
is
entirely
unconscious
while
you
are
speaking
through
her
It
is
strange
but
true
Did
you
ever
ask
yourself
what
life
really
is
Sp
No
I
had
no
time
I
had
to
use
my
mind
to
make
shoes
Dr
That
is
no
excuse

all

My
mother
says
At
this
point
the
spirit
was
removed

his
mother
assumed

is
real
There
are
no
mysterious
things
as
we
were
taught
I
believed
in
the
same
church
as
you
You
know
father
never
cared
for
church
and
do
you
know
he
progressed
more
rapidly
than
I
in
the
spirit
world
My
belief
and
dogma
held
me
back
You
remember
father
studied
and
we
called
him
crazy
because
once
in
a
while
he
went
to
Spiritualist
meetings
but
he
was
right
You
know
he
had
that
book
Heaven
and
Hell
by
Swedenborg
and
we
used
to
look
at
each
other
and
think
he
was
going
out
of
his
mind
We
went
to
church
and
he
did
not
yet
he
was
the
one
to
open
my
eyes
to
see
better
things
when
I
reached
the
spirit
side
of
life
If
he
had
not
opened
my
eyes
I
would
still
be
bound
in
my
former
belief
and
that
means
I
would
be
in
the
earth
sphere
I
was
always
afraid
if
he
died
he
would
go
to
hell
and
I
was
in
misery
You
remember
father
died
before
I
He
came
to
me
after
I
passed
out
but
I
thought
it
was
imagination
He
tried
very
hard
to
get
me
to
understand
I
want
to
tell
you
that
creeds
and
dogmas
of
the
church
cause
many
earthbound
spirits
These
spirits
do
harm
to
mortals
Henry
the
Bible
says
Where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
Your
treasure
was
your
workshop
You
have
been
in
your
shop
helping
that
young
fellow
unknown
to
yourself
We
could
not
get
you
First
you
were
crippled
and
we
could
not
get
you
to
realize
that
your
spiritual
body
was
not
crippled
but
your
mind
was
so
set
on
your
crippled
body
that
you
could
think
of
nothing
else
We
have
been
with
you
for
some
time
trying
to
get
you
to
come
with
us
but
we
could
not
One
day
we
were
passing
by
this
place
and
we
heard
singing
so
we
came
into
the
meeting
We
saw
that
spirits
were
made
to
understand
when
nobody
could
reach
them
otherwise
so
I
said
Let
us
bring
Henry
here
That
was
a
long
time
ago
We
had
to
wait
our
turn
before
we
could
bring
you
here
Now
Henry
open
your
spirit
eyes
and
see
that
your
spirit
body
is
fresh
and
new
Don
t
think
of
your
old
crippled
body
because
then
you
will
be
crippled
Think
of
your
young
spirit
body
and
you
will
be
young
You
will
be
happy
You
were
a
good
man
You
had
your
sorrows
but
you
tried
to
do
the
best
you
could
It
was
only
ignorance
false
doctrine
and
belief
that
held
you
back
Henry
we
have
a
beautiful
home
in
the
spirit
world
and
I
will
take
you
there
where
you
will
have
to
learn
many
things
The
first
thing
is
to
throw
away
all
selfishness
ignorance
self
pity
and
jealousy
Come
with
me
with
an
open
heart
Open
your
heart
to
God
in
a
spiritual
way
and
you
will
find
the
Kingdom
of
Heaven
within
you
You
have
much
to
learn
When
you
are
happy
you
will
find
that
happiness
and
love
are
Heaven
Selfishness
and
ignorance
are
hell
darkness
is
hell
People
make
hell
for
themselves
and
others
Let
us
do
all
we
can
to
help
others
and
forget
self
If
you
think
only
of
self
when
you
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
you
will
find
yourself
shut
up
in
a
room
alone
and
all
you
will
see
will
be
your
ignorance
and
selfishness
You
will
be
kept
in
this
condition
until
you
cry
out
God
help
me
to
forget
my
selfishness
Let
us
do
the
work
that
is
always
waiting
for
us
to
do
We
must
say
Get
thee
behind
me
Satan
Satan
or
the
devil
as
he
is
often
called
is
not
a
man
Satan
is
only
selfishness
ignorance
and
bigotry
these
are
the
devil
I
was
a
good
woman
but
I
had
to
suffer
because
I
lived
only
for
self
I
worshipped
my
church
My
husband
was
taken
away
from
me
I
worshipped
my
family
more
than
I
did
God
I
loved
my
church
and
when
I
passed
away
I
clung
to
it
I
had
a
daughter
and
I
got
into
her
magnetic
aura
and
clung
to
her
and
she
was
sent
to
the
asylum
I
could
not
get
away
from
her
She
died
then
she
was
free
and
so
was
I
Then
father
came
and
told
me
what
I
had
done
by
my
selfish
thoughts
Then
I
had
to
serve
All
my
work
was
with
little
children
not
my
own
children
for
they
were
taken
away
from
me
They
told
me
I
would
have
to
develop
as
much
love
for
other
children
as
I
had
for
my
own
and
when
I
reached
that
point
I
was
very
happy
Now
I
have
children
not
my
own
but
any
child
is
mine
because
one
child
is
as
much
God
s
child
as
another
and
we
should
love
them
all
We
should
care
for
one
as
well
as
the
other
I
have
my
reward
now
Every
one
loves
me
and
I
love
them
and
my
home
always
has
a
new
child
in
it
I
take
a
new
child
one
who
has
not
known
love
I
tell
him
of
the
life
beyond
I
want
him
to
have
an
understanding
of
God
Love
should
govern
all
not
one
child
but
all
The
great
Universal
Love
that
is
all
everything
One
child
should
be
loved
just
as
much
as
another
Therefore
be
very
careful
in
concentrating
your
love
on
one
child
or
just
your
own
family
Do
not
put
your
mind
on
one
child
because
when
you
pass
out
you
will
be
in
hell
You
will
stay
around
and
disturb
that
child
and
sometimes
as
in
my
case
the
child
goes
insane
My
poor
girl
was
called
insane
because
I
was
with
her
and
could
not
get
away
I
was
crying
all
the
time
because
I
wanted
only
my
child
I
did
not
realize
I
was
controlling
her
I
could
not
see
her
They
told
her
she
was
not
married
and
that
she
had
no
child
I
was
the
one
who
was
crying
for
my
child
my
daughter
Because
she
asked
for
her
child
when
she
had
none
they
said
she
was
crazy
and
sent
her
to
the
asylum
So
you
see
friends
how
necessary
it
is
that
we
should
all
learn
to
know
these
things
before
we
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
Let
us
be
wise
and
learn
all
we
can
while
here
The
more
we
learn
here
about
the
other
side
of
life
the
better
and
happier
we
shall
be
The
spirit
body
is
only
a
counterpart
of
the
physical
body
As
we
progress
in
mind
we
grow
If
we
intended
going
abroad
we
would
do
all
we
could
to
find
out
about
the
places
we
were
going
to
visit
and
what
hotels
to
stop
at
How
much
more
important
it
is
that
we
should
find
out
all
we
can
about
the
next
world
You
will
all
be
there
some
day
Find
out
all
you
can
then
when
you
are
ready
to
go
you
will
just
say
goodbye
and
wake
up
in
the
spirit
world
You
only
say
goodbye
to
the
physical
body
and
find
yourself
in
your
spiritual
body
If
you
have
lived
only
for
self
as
I
did
you
will
stay
right
where
you
have
been
just
where
you
left
off
as
I
did
and
suffer
This
is
a
lesson
and
you
can
profit
by
my
experience
Do
not
love
and
worship
your
own
children
more
than
others
that
is
selfish
love
Many
children
have
no
mother
Why
not
try
to
help
them
Divide
your
love
with
some
child
who
has
no
mother
I
have
over
one
hundred
to
care
for
now
I
have
tried
to
bring
them
up
and
give
them
a
mother
s
love
They
never
knew
the
comfort
of
a
home
I
have
worked
and
worked
for
Henry
because
I
loved
him
but
I
could
not
reach
him
My
husband
was
not
held
down
as
I
was
so
he
has
progressed
much
higher
than
I
Some
day
I
shall
probably
reach
where
he
is
He
studied
deeply
while
all
I
had
was
belief
Friends
take
advantage
of
what
I
suffered
and
learn
from
it
I
thank
you
for
allowing
me
to
bring
my
son
here
I
also
have
my
daughter
with
me
I
have
found
the
light
and
am
now
doing
missionary
work
among
the
little
children
Remember
do
not
be
selfish
enough
to
worship
your
own
children
but
have
a
mother
s
love
for
all
children
and
above
all
things
worship
God

Mrs
A
a
patient
from
Chicago
was
unusually
sensitive
to
psychic
influences
and
her
mother
Mrs
H
W
had
for
some
time
noticed
in
her
daughter
s
actions
a
similarity
to
the
mannerisms
of
a
minister
former
pastor
of
a
church
which
she
had
attended

had
been
killed
by
a

her

I
don

When

was
so
dark
I
couldn

I
have
such
pain
here
Placing

Now
I
remember
something
I
got
into
a
crowd
and
they
pushed
me
and
pushed
me
Earth

condition
after
death
Then
I
saw
just
a
little
star
of
light
Magnetic
aura
of
psychic
sensitive
the
patient
he
had
been
obsessing
They
seemed
to
be
crowding
me
in
and
in
until
at
last
I
got
to
hell
The
crowd
was
pushing
me
forward
and
I
did
not
know
where
I
was
going
then
I
got
these
sparks
I
always
thought
I
had
been
chosen
to
save
others
and
here
I
was
in
hell
myself
The
fire
was
awful
I
had
it
for
a
while
then
I
seemed
to
get
lost
again
I
don
t
know
what
is
to
become

me

What

I
do
not

I
am
so
dazed
I
can

I
seem
to
be
getting
somewhere
I
must
have
gone
through
a
very
severe
sickness
People
crowded
me
and
they
came
after
me

I
felt
I
had
not

was
always
sincere

Yes

Did

believe

Yes

I
went

I
was

Now

There
are
so
many
people
around

In

I
cannot
recall
that
I
am
dead
but
I
know
I
have
been
mixed
up
I
am
in
such
a
crowd
What
is
the
matter
with
my

Mr

Do
you
know
a
Mrs
Nelson
who
used
to
live
on
Foster
Avenue
Sp
Yes
that

my

There
was
somebody
else
along

when
I
came
to
the
trains

they
pushed
me
ahead
of
the
train
The
train
was
coming
this
way
and
I
was
going
over
there
Somebody
got
hold
of
me
and
then
there
was
such
a
big
crowd
I
remember
the
big
crowd
after
I
was
hit
by
the
train
That
big
crowd
has
been
after
me
all
the
time
Spirits
Dr
That
is
because
you
did
not
teach
them
correctly
Sp
Somebody
says
These
are
your
followers
that
you
have
misled
in
the
wrong
path
Dr
Why
did
you
mislead
them
Sp
I
taught
them
God
s
truth
Dr
Possibly
as
far
as
you
knew
Sp
I
tried
to
save
humanity
from
hell
Dr
And
then
you
went
there
yourself
Sp
I
was
only
in
it
for
a
little
while
but
it
was
terrible
I
did
not
imagine
it
that
way
I
thought
hell
would
be
different
than
pouring
down
fire
fire
and
brimstone
and
it
smarted
like
everything
I
cannot
see
why
I
should
have
been
in
hell

must
be
because
your
teachings
were
wrong
All
these
people
accuse
you
of
having
misled
them
Sp
I
gave
myself
up
to
God
Dr
Did
God
ask
you
to
do
that
Or
did
you
do
it
for
a
living
Sp
I
tried
to
save
people
from
sin
I
suppose
I
did
save
some
Dr
You
did
not
save
yourself
Sp
That
lady
over
there
pointing
to
Mrs
H
W
should
go
to
hell
She
did
not
stick
to
the
church
as
she
should
Dr
You
stuck
to
the
church
and
yet
you
say
you
have
been
in
hell
Sp
Yes
that
s
so
Dr
Then
how
do
you
know
your
church
and
your
teaching
were
right
You
were
a
Servant
of
God
yet
you
went
to
hell
You
were
supposed
to
be
better
than
the
congregation
Sp
Pointing
Is
that
Mrs

Dr
Yes
Sp
To
Mrs

Why
don

you
go
to
church
Mrs
H
W
I
do
sometimes
Dr
She
doesn

want
to
go
to
hell
where
you
say
you
have
been
You
went
to
church

yet
you
went
to
hell
You
taught
the
wrong
thing
You
do
not
want
her

follow
in
your
footsteps
do
you
Sp
I
don
t
want
her
to
go
to
hell
where
I
have

Then
the
church
must
be
wrong
Mr

You
were
killed
eight
years
ago
SP
I
have
not
seen
my

a
long
time
Dr
You
did
not
preach
the
truth
when
you
were
trying
to
save
souls
and
you
did
not
save
your
own
For
years
you
have
been
in
the
purgatory
of
ignorance

How
is
my

She
loved

Mr

She
is
well

How
could
my

Mr

She

buried

Yes
Dr
Do

mean
Dr
Ghosts
Sp
No
Dr
Doesn
t
the
Bible
speak
of
them
Sp
Not
particularly
Dr
Yes
it
does
Jesus
used
to
cast
out
unclean
spirits
and
the
apostles
did
also
Have
you
met
Jesus
Sp
No
I
have
not
met
any
one
I
have
been
in
the
crowd
and
they
have
been
pushing
me
all
the
time
Dr
Those
were
people
whom
you
had
taught
falsely
before
they
died
Sp
One
day
I
saw
a
little
light
Dr
You
got
into
the
aura
of
this
lady
Mrs
A
Mr
A
She
is
my
wife
Why
are
you
bothering
her
Why
don
t
you
go
to
the
Heaven
you
taught
Why
do
you
stay
around
the
earth
Sp
Are
you
in
hell
too
Mr
A
No
we
are
on
earth
Your
hell
was
static
electricity
that
we
gave
you
Dr
That
was
the
only
way
we
could
drive
you
away
from
this
lady
Mr
A
Why
didn
t
you
go
the
way
you
taught
Sp
I
do
not
know
Mr
A
Why
didn
t
you
teach
the
truth
when
you
lived
on
earth
Sp
I
taught
the
way
I
learned
and
the
Bishop
told
me
what
to
do
I
taught
the
religion
taught
on
earth
Dr
That
is
a
misconception
You
yourself
have
proven
that
it
is
a
fallacy
You
have
been
dead
eight
years
and
yet
you
are
an
earthbound
spirit
Sp
I
certainly
expected
to
be
in
Heaven
Dr
You
did
not
teach
the
truth
That
lady
Mrs
H
W
will
reach
Heaven
quicker
than
you
will
Sp
She
will
How
do
you
know
that
Dr
She
has
learned
the
real
truth
the
truth
of
the
spirit
world
and
spirit
existence
Paul
taught
about
spirits
Jesus
cast
out
unclean
spirits
Sp
We
cannot
compare
ourselves
with
Jesus
Jesus
was
the
son
of
God
Dr
The
Bible
says
Ye
are
all
the
children
of
God
and
Jesus
said
I
and
my
Father
are
one
Sp
He
was
God
s
Beloved
Son
God
sent
Him
to
save
us
from
sin
Dr
I
will
tell
you
who
said
that
In
the
year
A
D
at
the
Council
of
Nice
Italy
Constantine
declared
Jesus
to
be
The
Son
of
God
and
very
God
and
his
declaration
was
officially
accepted
by
the
Christian
Church
Sp
Christ
was
God
s
Beloved
Son
and
if
we
believe
in
Him
we
shall
inherit
salvation
Dr
Why
didn
t
you
do
it
Sp
Jesus
is
God
s
Son
and
if
you
believe
in
Him
you
will
be
saved
Dr
Then
where
are
you
now
Sp
I
don
t
quite
understand
it
yet
Dr
But
you
said
you
had
been
in
hell
Does
your
conscience
not
tell
you
you
were
wrong
I
think
it
does
Sp
It
accuses
me
Dr
If
you
will
listen
carefully
you
will
realize
that
you
were
wrong
You
never
felt
quite
satisfied
with
the
story
of
God
s
creation
of
the
world
did
you
Sp
We
should
not
argue
about
God
God
is
perfect
and
we
are
His
children
and
if
we
believe
in
Him
we
shall
inherit
salvation
Dr
You
say
God
is
perfect
You
say
God
created
everything
and
that
He
knows
everything
therefore
He
must
have
known
beforehand
that
His
creation
would
be
imperfect
and
that
man
would
fall
in
sin
Would
you
create
a
world
and
then
destroy
it
Sp
People
fall
in
sin
and
God
s
Son
came
to
save
us
Dr
Did
God
know
that
the
world
would
fall
in
sin
Did
He
know
it
and
yet
create
it
Does
that
sound
reasonable
Did
He
know
that
fallen
angels
would
obsess
people
Was
He
All
Wise
The
preachers
are
at
fault
in
their
teachings
Sp
We
were
taught
that
When
we
are
teachers
of
the
Gospel
we
must
live
up
to
it
and
we
must
believe
it
Dr
You
did
not
use
your
reason
or
you
would
not
have
believed
what
you
were
taught
The
people
who
are
crowding
you
now
are
evidently
the
very
ones
you
tried
to
save
and
they
too
are
in
darkness
They
did
not
find
Heaven
What
does
the
Bible
say
Ye
are
the
temple
of
God
and
the
Spirit
of
God
dwelleth
in
you
God
is
Love
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
Love
dwelleth
in
God
According
to
your
teachings
you
should
have
found
God
before
this
But
you
have
not
The
teachings
of
Jesus
contain
wonderful
truths
but
they
are
not
understood
It
is
easier
to
teach
that
Jesus
died
for
our
sins
and
that
we
will
be
saved
and
everything
will
be
all
right
Now
you
will
have
to
obtain
understanding
Sp
If
I
am
dead
then
I
should
see
God
Dr
You
will
never
see
God
God
is
not
a
person
on
a
throne
God
is
Spirit
and
God
is
Intelligence
Have
you
ever
seen
music
Sp
I
have
heard
it
Dr
Did
you
love
your
wife
and
family
Sp
Yes
I
did
Dr
Have
you
ever
seen
that
love
If
you
understand
the
Love
Principle
in
the
higher
sense
you
will
understand
that
God
is
Love
That
was
Jesus
own
teaching
Sp
We
have
to
teach
as
I
did
Don
t
you
think
Mrs
W
that
I
did
all
right
Dr
She
left
your
church
Sp
She
went
astray
Dr
You
say
you
are
a
man
and
yet
here
you
are
controlling
my
wife
s
body
Did
you
ever
believe
in
mediumship
Sp
That
is
all
humbug
Dr
There
must
be
some
truth
in
it
You
are
proving
it
yourself
Sp
I
didn
t
feel
that
anybody
should
give
up
church
for
that
humbug
Dr
You
yourself
are
proving
that
it
is
not
a
humbug
for
you
are
talking
through
a
medium
now
Look
at
these
hands
and
see
if
they
belong
to
you
Did
you
have
a
wedding
ring
Sp
That
s
a
woman
s
ring
Dr
You
are
using
my
wife
s
body
Sp
How
did
I
get
into
it
Dr
You
are
an
invisible
spirit
We
do
not
see
you
You
are
talking
through
my
wife
s
physical
organs
Now
you
see
how
little
you
really
know
of
the
laws
of
Life
and
Love
and
the
Hereafter
Sp
Things
seem
so
strange
There
was
a
time
I
recall
now
I
am
getting
some
of
my
memory
back
I
recall
I
got
hurt
Dr
When
the
train
struck
you
you
were
driven
from
your
body
Sp
I
remember
going
home
and
I
stayed
at
home
but
my
wife
didn
t
seem
to
notice
me
Dr
Your
wife
did
not
know
you
were
there
You
were
invisible
to
her
Sp
I
tried
to
talk
to
her
and
the
children
but
they
took
n
notice
of
me
so
I
thought
what
s
the
use
I
prayed
and
prayed
I
went
away
from
my
wife
and
I
could
not
get
back
I
was
parted
from
her
and
everything
was
so
strange
Then
I
got
into
this
crowd
and
they
followed
me
and
again
I
tried
to
go
home
and
after
I
got
there
I
talked
to
my
wife
and
children
but
it
seemed
as
if
no
one
cared
for
me
because
they
would
not
talk
to
me
and
took
no
notice
of
me
I
put
my
hand
on
my
wife
and
it
seemed
as
if
my
hand
went
right
through
her
I
talked
to
my
wife
again
but
no
response
so
I
went
out
again
and
got
into
that
crowd
and
I
was
with
them
until
I
got
into
hell
There
were
so
many
in
the
crowd
that
we
were
like
sardines
One
came
after
another
and
then
I
was
pushed
ahead
Controlled
the
sensitive
I
saw
a
little
light
and
after
that
there
was
fire
and
brimstone
Dr
You
were
in
the
magnetic
aura
of
that
lady
Mrs
A
and
obsessed
her
and
finally
controlled
her
body
Sp
How
could
I
do
that
Dr
I
am
going
to
answer
your
question
in
true
Yankee
style
by
asking
another
How
could
you
control
this
body
You
see
how
little
you
know
about
the
mysteries
of
God
You
preached
only
a
doctrine
but
did
not
understand
the
truth
Sp
When
you
go
to
a
Seminary
and
learn
what
they
teach
you
you
have
to
preach
it
whether
you
like
it
or
not
Dr
You
sinned
against
the
Holy
Ghost
because
your
better
judgment
told
you
it
was
not
right
Jesus
did
not
teach
what
you
taught
Sp
I
was
not
very
successful
in
my
ministry
this
statement
was
afterward
confirmed
as
many
others
are
not
because
it
seemed
as
if
the
audience
my
followers
did
not
stand
by
me
and
then
I
was
discouraged
and
felt
what
was
the
use
No
one
seemed
to
care
for
my
preaching
I
was
very
discouraged
I
felt
sometimes
as
if
I
should
give
up
the
whole
thing
Dr
Why
didn
t
you
Sp
If
I
should
tell
you
the
truth
and
tell
you
why
I
didn
t
I
should
say
it
was
because
I
had
a
wife
and
family
to
support
But
I
was
not
successful
as
a
minister
I
wish
I
had
never
studied
for
the
ministry
but
had
been
more
of
a
mechanic
I
would
have
had
a
happier
life
It
was
later
learned
that
during
his
earth
life
the
spirit
had
made
this
same
remark
to
a
fellow
minister
I
could
not
provide
for
my
wife
as
I
wanted
to
and
she
is
a
good
woman
My
salary
was
small
and
when
you
have
a
family
to
support
and
have
to
get
your
salary
by
your
mouth
it
is
hard
when
you
don
t
get
any
encouragement
from
your
followers
Some
found
fault
with
me
I
would
go
into
the
pulpit
and
my
heart
would
not
be
in
my
work
because
I
knew
they
did
not
like
me
I
was
not
happy
I
wished
that
I
had
not
studied
in
my
younger
days
but
had
earned
an
honest
living
I
see
things
now
that
I
did
not
see
before
I
was
blind
and
I
see
now
that
I
was
greatly
at
fault
I
should
not
have
followed
in
the
path
I
did
They
found
fault
with
me
here
and
there
and
the
Bishop
sent
a
poor
fellow
from
one
place
to
another
and
sometimes
it
meant
a
whole
month
s
salary
Sometimes
I
had
to
borrow
money
so
that
I
could
move
At
last
I
got
tired
of
being
moved
around
I
would
get
a
few
friends
in
one
place
then
we
would
have
to
move
and
I
got
discouraged
Finally
I
got
a
house
and
I
said
I
was
going
to
stay
there
and
told
them
if
they
did
not
want
me
or
they
could
not
find
anything
for
me
to
do
I
would
go
to
work
I
never
could
get
enough
together
to
properly
support
my
family
because
they
changed
me
so
often
The
Bishop
would
move
me
from
one
place
to
another
That
is
not
the
right
life
to
live
I
would
not
wish
my
worst
enemy
to
be
a
minister
It
s
pretty
hard
on
a
fellow
Now
I
am
in
a
worse
condition
that
I
was
because
I
m
blind
Dr
Before
you
leave
here
we
will
open
your
eyes
and
send
you
on
your
way
rejoising
First
tell
me
if
there
is
any
cure
for
my
blindness
Dr
We
will
open
your
eyes
The
Bible
says
Eyes
have
they
but
they
see
not
they
have
ears
but
they
hear
not
Yours
is
only
spiritual
blindness
Sp
I
wish
I
could
open
those
spiritual
eyes
Dr
It
is
not
the
fault
of
Jesus
teachings
that
you
are
spiritually
blind
It
was
wrong
to
teach
as
you
taught
That
is
the
cause
of
your
present
condition
If
you
say
that
God
sent
Jesus
as
a
special
Savior
you
infer
that
God
made
a
mistake
when
He
created
man
and
He
did
not
Sp
Jesus
was
God
s
Beloved
Son
Dr
That
conception
is
wrong
Jesus
said
I
and
my
Father
are
one
and
we
are
told
in
the
Bible
Ye
are
all
the
children
of
God
Are
we
not
strangers
to
ourselves
Sp
We
fall
in
sin
Do
you
believe
in
the
Devil
Dr
In
the
first
place
God
is
not
a
person
He
is
Spirit
All
Wise
All
Powerful
everywhere
present
We
accept
that
as
the
first
principle
in
the
Universe
God
is
All
in
All
If
God
is
All
in
All
as
the
Bible
says
would
He
make
the
big
mistake
which
Christianity
implies
he
made
when
it
asserts
that
God
s
creation
was
so
imperfectly
planned
that
man
was
doomed
to
fall
in
sin
and
that
the
sending
of
a
Savior
was
the
only
means
of
rectifying
this
mistake
The
church
teaches
that
some
of
the
angels
fell
That
means
they
became
something
inferior
How
could
that
be
if
they
were
created
out
of
God
s
own
substance
That
Something
Supreme
created
the
world
and
placed
us
here
had
He
not
forethought
and
foresight
enough
to
see
what
would
happen
Sp
We
were
born
into
this
world
and
fell
in
sin
Dr
Didn
t
God
know
what
would
happen
Sp
I
suppose
so
Dr
I
am
showing
you
that
the
orthodox
teaching
is
wrong
Much
of
the
Bible
is
simply
a
collection
of
allegories
Jesus
always
spoke
in
parables
Spiritual
things
must
be
spiritually
discerned
When
Jesus
wished
to
teach
the
people
that
they
should
love
their
fellow
man
as
themselves
what
did
He
say
He
told
them
the
story
of
The
Good
Samaritan
the
story
of
a
certain
man
who
went
from
Jerusalem
to
Jericho
and
fell
among
thieves
who
beat
him
and
left
him
half
dead
A
certain
priest
came
that
way
and
when
he
saw
him
he
passed
by
on
the
other
side
Then
a
Levite
came
and
he
passed
by
on
the
other
side
But
a
certain
Samaritan
came
and
when
he
saw
him
he
had
compassion
on
him
and
bound
up
his
wounds
and
brought
him
to
an
inn
and
cared
for
him
And
when
he
left
the
inn
he
paid
the
host
to
take
care
of
the
man
Then
Jesus
asked
the
lawyer
which
one
represented
his
fellow
man
and
the
lawyer
answered
He
that
showed
mercy
Sp
But
that
is
history
Dr
No
that
is
allegory
Sp
How
do
you
know
Dr
The
very
Bible
tells
us
so
Jesus
told
that
story
simply
as
a
parable
to
show
what
The
principle
Your
doctrine
blinded
you
Sp
Then
don
t
you
believe
that
really
happened
Dr
No
Jesus
spoke
in
parables
Sp
I
was
not
taught
that
way
When
I
was
not
taught
that
way
how
could
I
know
more
than
I
did
Ministers
teach
as
I
did
all
the
time
The
way
you
say
it
is
all
new
to
me
Dr
That
is
the
true
teaching
of
Jesus
Sp
Don
t
you
believe
he
died
for
our
sins
Dr
No
I
do
not
Did
Jesus
die
to
please
God
Sp
No
he
died
to
save
us
from
sin
Dr
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
God
created
a
special
son
for
people
to
kill
so
they
could
be
saved
Sp
We
must
not
talk
against
God
Dr
I
am
talking
against
erroneous
teachings
Sp
Do
you
believe
in
such
things
Mrs
W
Mrs
H
W
I
do
now
Dr
Jesus
said
Except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
What
do
children
do
They
ask
questions
They
want
to
know
Did
you
seek
to
understand
No
You
only
tried
to
teach
the
doctrine
of
belief
Did
you
ever
understand
flowers
Sp
They
belong
to
Nature
We
must
not
worship
Nature
Dr
God
made
Nature
We
must
not
worship
Nature
we
must
worship
God
But
God
is
in
Nature
He
speaks
to
us
through
Nature
The
corrected
translations
of
the
Bible
tell
us
that
Jesus
said
God
is
Spirit
He
did
not
say
God
is
a
Spirit
but
God
is
Spirit
and
they
that
worship
Him
must
worship
Him
in
Spirit
and
in
truth
Sp
I
never
heard
things
explained
like
that
before
Dr
We
want
to
open
your
spiritual
eyes
so
that
you
can
see
God
is
Love
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
Love
dwelleth
in
God
Where
are
you
going
to
find
God
outside
of
yourself
What
is
love
What
does
love
look
like
Sp
I
cannot
describe
how
it
looks
You
feel
it
Dr
Love
is
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
Sp
Are
you
a
minister
Dr
Not
as
you
understand
the
term
I
honor
God
but
not
dogma
I
realize
that
the
Universe
did
not
make
itself
God
is
Spirit
Power
the
Soul
of
the
Universe
He
is
a
Practical
Something
in
which
the
heavenly
bodies
all
move
If
we
want
to
understand
God
we
must
understand
ourselves
We
must
try
to
understand
why
we
are
living
beings
What
is
the
size
and
breadth
of
mind
How
large
or
small
is
mind
Sp
You
say
that
I
am
a
spirit
and
that
I
am
talking
through
this
lady
s
body
How
is
that
possible
You
also
say
that
I
bothered
that
other
lady
Mrs
A
Dr
There
is
a
psychic
law
whereby
spirits
can
control
mortals
When
correctly
followed
we
have
spirit
communication
of
the
highest
order
Perversion
of
this
law
results
in
obsession
Mrs
A
is
a
natural
psychic
and
you
and
other
spirits
came
into
her
magnetic
aura
and
interfered
with
her
life
She
came
to
California
to
be
helped
She
is
in
California
now
and
so
are
you
Sp
California
How
did
I
get
here
Dr
By
another
wonderful
law
You
followed
her
The
obsession
of
mortals
by
spirits
is
a
fact
that
has
been
known
in
all
ages
Sp
You
do
not
mean
that
I
have
been
bothering
that
lady
Dr
Yes
and
would
have
helped
to
ruin
her
life
Sp
How
did
I
get
to
her
Dr
How
did
you
come
here
How
are
you
controlling
the
body
of
Mrs
Wickland
Sp
I
don
t
realize
that
I
have
ever
done
any
wrong
Dr
We
had
to
give
the
lady
the
electrical
treatment
we
did
in
order
to
expel
you
from
her
aura
You
are
not
the
only
one
that
has
been
removed
When
many
minds
try
to
function
through
one
body
it
creates
a
disturbance
Others
would
say
that
my
wife
is
insane
just
now
because
she
is
a
woman
and
yet
you
speaking
through
her
say
you
are
a
man
and
a
minister
Another
mystery
is
that
Mrs
Wickland
is
entirely
unconscious
at
this
time
Sp
How
did
I
come
to
this
body
Dr
Spirit
helpers
brought
you
here
and
allowed
you
to
control
my
wife
because
she
is
a
psychic
sensitive
Sp
I
did
not
mean
to
do
anybody
harm
I
just
followed
the
crowd
and
they
pushed
me
in
I
did
not
know
any
one
in
particular
in
the
crowd
I
was
blind
and
could
not
see
so
I
just
kept
with
them
Dr
Do
you
know
why
you
were
blind
You
had
lost
your
physical
eyes
but
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
You
were
in
the
spirit
world
but
you
knew
nothing
of
the
spiritual
laws
You
were
in
what
the
Bible
calls
outer
darkness
Sp
Does
outer
darkness
mean
when
you
don
t
understand
Dr
Yes
When
you
lost
your
physical
body
you
lost
your
physical
eyes
but
you
did
not
know
it
and
since
you
did
not
understand
the
higher
life
your
spiritual
vision
was
not
open
Sp
I
have
had
a
body
and
I
have
had
eyes
Dr
You
have
a
spiritual
body
but
you
were
mentally
blind
Do
you
remember
that
Paul
spoke
of
a
natural
body
and
a
spiritual
body
First
that
which
is
natural
and
afterward
that
which
is
spiritual
Sp
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
I
was
spiritually
blind
when
I
was
a
spiritual
adviser
Dr
Yes
When
you
have
your
spiritual
eyes
open
you
will
realize
what
Jesus
meant
when
He
said
I
and
my
Father
are
one
Jesus
said
Be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
Father
which
is
in
Heaven
is
perfect
The
Bible
says
Add
to
your
faith
knowledge
and
Jesus
said
Know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
The
Bible
states
Blessed
is
he
that
hath
part
in
the
first
resurrection
that
is
obtains
understanding
while
in
the
body
on
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
meaning
that
when
ignorance
is
replaced
by
understanding
spiritual
light
is
obtained
Sp
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
I
had
no
real
comprehension
of
the
truth
Dr
You
had
faith
but
you
did
not
have
knowledge
you
only
had
orthodoxy
Sp
Then
you
mean
that
all
my
followers
and
the
church
people
who
came
to
hear
me
will
all
be
spiritually
blind
Dr
Many
of
them
may
be
if
they
follow
your
teachings
If
you
look
you
will
probably
see
others
here
SP
There
is
a
big
audience
here
and
they
are
all
listening
During
a
psychic
circle
of
this
nature
many
earthbound
spirits
are
brought
to
profit
by
the
experience
of
the
spirit
who
is
controlling
the
psychic
Dr
It
is
our
own
stupidity
that
keeps
us
back
We
should
use
the
wonderful
mind
that
God
gave
us
We
have
the
marvelous
universe
to
study
and
try
to
understand
Did
you
ever
stop
to
think
how
fruit
grows
You
plant
a
seed
in
the
ground
it
decomposes
and
out
of
it
grows
a
tree
Sp
That
belongs
to
Nature
Dr
Nature
is
the
body
of
God
God
is
All
in
All
You
taught
that
in
church
Sp
I
have
said
that
many
times
but
I
did
not
see
it
as
you
do
Dr
If
God
is
All
in
All
would
not
creation
itself
be
a
part
of
God
Sp
I
never
thought
of
it
in
that
light
It
seems
strange
that
while
I
gave
truth
to
my
people
I
should
find
myself
in
this
darkness
Say
are
you
a
minister
Dr
No
I
am
not
but
I
try
to
understand
God
s
wonders
and
the
meaning
of
existence
Sp
You
have
studied
the
Bible
pretty
well
You
seem
to
know
the
Bible
much
better
than
I
did
myself
Dr
I
regard
its
teachings
differently
Sp
You
seem
to
quote
the
Bible
by
heart
I
should
like
to
have
you
write
down
all
you
have
told
me
I
should
like
to
have
your
statements
written
down

if
I
could
give
it
to
the
people
as
you
have
given
it
to
me
I
should
be
very
glad
Dr
Now
your
spiritual
eyes
will
be
opened
and
you
will
see
others
who
will
teach
you
the
same
things
Advanced
spirits
will
teach
you
how
to
progress
in
a
rational
way
in
the
spirit
world
and
you
will
be
taught
much
more
than
I
tell
you
You
will
not
be
in
the
dark
any
longer
If
you
will
look
around
you
may
see
some
one
you
know
who
has
passed
on

Should
we
call
them
back
Dr
Call
them
back
from
where
Sp
From
Heaven
Dr
Jesus
said
The
Kingdom
of
God
is
within
you

in
the
Bible
you
will
find
Ye
are
the
temple
of
God

Spirit
of
God
dwelleth
in
you

Don
t
you
think
we
should
all
go
to
Heaven
Dr
Heaven
is
not
a
place

We
must
have
some
place
to
stay
Dr
Heaven
is
a
condition
of
mind
When
you
are
happy
is
that
not
Heaven
The
more
happiness
you
create
around
yourself
the
more
Heaven

will
have
Happiness
is
Heaven

But
we
have
to
be
in
some
place

You
are
in

spirit
world
I
have
told
you
that
You
can
only
attain
Heaven
or
happiness
as
you
develop
Sp
Where
is
that
place
the
spirit
world
Dr
It
surrounds
the
physical
world
You
will
be
taught
all
that
Jesus
said
Seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
Sp
There
are
many
people
here
Spirits
Some
are
very
happy
and
contented
and
they
seem
to
be
asking
me
to
come
to
the
home
of
understanding
life
happiness
and
the
spirit
world
What
is
the
spirit
world
Dr
That
is
the
world
of
the
spirits
who
understand
Nature
s
higher
laws
Sp
Before
I
go
with
them
I
should
so
like
to
send
a
message
to
my
wife
Will
somebody
take
it
to
her
Mrs
H
W
I
will
be
glad
to
Sp
Tell
my
wife
I
have
found
that
life
is
more
serious
than
I
thought
and
we
should
try
to
understand
more
of
God
s
wonders
and
not
only
believe
Spiritual
vision
opening
with
a
flood
of
understanding
face
upturned
and
arms
outstretched
I
want
to
tell
my
wife
that
I
have
learned
more
about
the
wonderful
world
beyond
than
I
ever
knew
before
My
spiritual
eyes
are
open
I
wish
so
much
that
she
could
accept
the
proof
that
has
been
revealed
to
me
All
this
time
as
you
have
told
me
I
have
been
dead
I
have
been
in
darkness
but
as
this
gentleman
tells
me
it
was
a
spiritual
darkness
My
eyes
are
open
and
I
can
now
see
A
beautiful
world
lies
before
me
I
want
my
wife
to
understand
these
things
so
that
she
will
not
be
in
the
dark
as
I
have
been
Tell
her
not
to
have
belief
alone
Investigate
and
find
out
what
the
life
beyond
is
I
do
wish
I
could
teach
about
the
beautiful
land
beyond
as
I
see
it
before
me
There
are
wonderful
landscapes
and
homes
of
all
descriptions
My
eyes
are
open
and
now
I
see
Here
is
one
beautiful
home
and
there
another
A
man
stands
here
and
he
says
to
me
that
the
homes
in
the
spirit
world
are
not
bought
with
money
but
are
acquired
by
good
acts
done
here
on
earth
This
man
this
teacher
says
Be
unselfish
and
have
love
for
others
then
you
will
have
a
beautiful
home
in
the
spirit
world
If
you
live
for
yourself
alone
you
will
have
only
a
little
shanty
for
you
have
done
nothing
to
help
your
fellow
man
Give
help
to
others
and
serve
the
ones
who
need
help
These
are
also
the
teachings
of
Jesus
I
see
beautiful
homes
around
but
where
is
mine
I
have
none
I
have
not
seen
it
yet
Dr
By
helping
and
serving
others
you
will
soon
have
one
Sp
I
want
my
wife
to
know
that
we
should
live
so
on
earth
that
when
we
come
to
the
beautiful
world
beyond
we
shall
have
a
home
We
must
do
as
our
better
nature
tells
us
to
do
Dr
Now
you
are
preaching
an
excellent
sermon
Sp
I
am
not
preaching
it
This
man
spirit
tells
me
that
He
stands
right
here
by
me
He
says
The
Bible
states
It
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
Kingdom
of
God
He
says
I
will
illustrate
to
you
what
a
home
would
be
if
a
man
sells
his
soul
for
money
and
does
not
help
others
There
is
the
home
of
a
millionaire
who
has
taken
money
from
the
poor
people
and
grasped
all
he
could
In
the
spirit
world
his
house
will
be
a
mere
hovel
in
the
ground
for
he
could
not
enter
one
of
those
beautiful
homes
Those
homes
were
built
by
good
deeds
done
for
others
and
not
for
self
He
will
have
to
work
through
service
to
an
understanding
of
a
higher
condition
There
are
homes
of
all
descriptions
and
castles
too
This
teacher
says
that
many
times
there
are
in
these
beautiful
castles
poor
old
widows
and
men
who
were
outcasts
but
who
lived
for
others
and
not
for
self
Their
acts
were
acts
of
kindness
not
selfishness
They
made
many
sacrifices
There
are
many
homes
from
castles
down
and
down
until
they
are
made
of
dirt
many
surrounded
by
snakes
a
miserable
condition
through
which
the
selfish
must
pass
Now
he
points
to
a
house
and
says
This
is
yours
this
little
tiny
house
You
were
honest
in
what
you
taught
so
you
have
a
house
even
though
small
Some
have
none
You
did
not
seek
for
the
truth
you
accepted
things
as
they
were
presented
to
you
Now
you
will
have
to
work
for
others
and
make
a
home
for
your
wife
and
children
You
must
work
now
and
try
to
help
them
realize
the
beauties
of
the
life
beyond
Is
it
not
more
beautiful
to
see
the
spirit
world
in
the
true
sense
of
life
than
to
preach
the
gospel
of
condemnation
Why
should
we
not
open
our
spiritual
eyes
and
understand
God
as
He
is
instead
of
picturing
Him
as
a
monster
of
cruelty
He
says
Christians
murder
their
fellow
men
The
war
has
grown
out
of
selfishness
The
churches
will
soon
fall
and
there
will
be
a
new
religion
that
will
bring
true
understanding
and
all
people
on
earth
will
open
their
eyes
and
see
the
real
truth
of
God
s
wonderful
manifestations
Isn
t
it
wonderful
How
I
wish
I
could
come
back
and
tell
people
the
truth
as
I
see
it
now
I
would
tell
my
people
that
I
had
not
taught
properly
and
so
had
not
helped
them
Now
I
could
give
them
the
truth
and
help
them
I
would
not
need
to
tell
them
that
if
they
did
not
live
the
right
kind
of
life
they
would
go
to
hell
Hell
is
only
ignorance
and
selfishness
If
only
I
could
give
this
truth
to
my
followers
How
I
wish
I
could
go
back
and
preach
what
I
know
now
I
would
work
to
help
them
to
a
spiritual
understanding
and
I
would
not
teach
condemnation
as
I
sometimes
did
I
would
try
to
help
them
open
their
eyes
and
understand
what
life
really
is
I
wish
that
they
could
see
the
beautiful
land
and
homes
that
I
have
seen
I
will
work
and
work
hard
to
make
a
home
for
my
wife
and
children
The
home
I
want
is
not
mine
yet
but
I
have
a
small
beginning
I
will
work
to
give
my
wife
and
children
the
home
I
have
always
wanted
them
to
have
What
is
this
With
great
excitement
This
man
says
this
is
the
lower
sphere
I
see
where
ignorant
spirits
travel
in
darkness
Here
is
another
scene
which
is
the
result
of
my
work
How
sick
these
spirits
are
and
how
crippled
They
are
blind
and
grasping
Dr
They
are
showing
you
the
lower
earth
sphere
Sp
This
man
says
they
are
showing
me
the
result
of
orthodox
teaching
Look
at
those
drunkards
and
murderers
Dr
They
are
now
showing
you
these
scenes
so
when
you
leave
this
body
and
begin
to
progress
you
can
better
help
others
Sp
He
says
this
is
a
condition
which
false
teachings
and
human
selfishness
have
created
These
spirits
look
like
snakes
Look
at
the
nails
on
their
hands
This
is
terrible
Some
are
on
their
knees
crawling
and
some
are
on
all
fours
That
and
that
and
that
is
my
work
Oh
God
This
is
the
result
of
wrong
teaching
It
is
terrible
Now
this
man
shows
me
an
asylum
of
crazy
people
and
there
are
crazy
spirits
around
them
all
Oh
that
is
hell
hell
They
shout
and
howl
What
a
sight
what
a
horrible
sight
They
are
showing
me
the
real
things
Here
is
a
human
being
with
three
or
four
spirits
crawling
on
him
Now
he
shows
me
another
place
it
is
this
place
here
Institute
Hall
There
is
a
Spirit
Home
built
within
this
room
an
Inner
Hall
There
are
many
spirits
here
He
says
We
take
them
from
obsessed
mortals
and
bring
them
into
this
Hall
and
keep
them
there
until
we
can
convert
them
Often
we
must
have
them
control
this
psychic
to
bring
them
to
an
understanding
By
bringing
one
to
an
understanding
the
door
is
opened
for
many
others
One
or
two
are
allowed
to
control
and
the
others
see
how
they
are
enlightened
and
then
they
learn
that
they
also
must
go
with
friendly
spirits
to
the
world
beyond
Let
us
preach
the
gospel
of
truth
so
there
will
not
be
this
earthbound
spirit
condition
caused
by
ignorance
and
selfishness
If
only
I
could
return
to
help
preach
this
great
truth
that
I
have
found
Dr
Now
you
have
been
shown
the
way
and
you
must
go
with
these
advanced
spirits
who
will
help
you
Sp
Will
I
go
with
that
man
Dr
Yes
He
will
teach
you
many
great
truths
Sp
He
says
that
it
is
false
teaching
of
ministers
which
brings
people
to
this
hell
He
says
I
must
go
but
before
I
go
I
want
to
thank
you
all
for
helping
me
to
a
home
in
the
spirit
world
To
Mr
A
He
also
wants
me
to
ask
you
to
please
forgive
me
I
meant
no
wrong
to
your
wife
it
was
only
ignorance
on
my
part
To
Mrs
A
I
want
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
I
will
help
you
all
I
can
but
not
before
I
know
how
I
will
do
all
within
my
power
to
help
you
become
free
from
the
condition
you
are
in
Now
I
see
those
around
you
Fight
and
we
will
help
you
win
I
also
want
to
thank
you
Mrs
W
for
helping
me
because
this
man
says
you
helped
me
to
an
understanding
God
bless
you
and
my
dear
wife
Please
bring
this
message
to
her
Three
years
after
the
above
experience
when
Mrs
H
W
was
again
present
in
our
circle
the
spirit
of
Pastor
Nelson
returned
and
spoke
through
the
psychic
EXPERIENCE

J
NELSON
PSYCHIC
MRS
WICKLAND
I
have
come
here
tonight
to
thank
you
all
for
the
help
I
received
in
this
little
circle
You
gave
me
the
truth
and
I
also
learned
that
I
had
unconsciously
been
obsessing
some
one
I
wish
all
could
understand
and
know
the
laws
that
govern
the
spirit
conditions
on
this
earth
life
I
was
not
a
bad
spirit
but
I
was
ignorant
of
the
laws
I
should
have
been
much
more
enlightened
because
I
used
to
preach
to
people
and
try
to
help
them
understand
the
real
life
but
how
few
ministers
who
stand
in
the
pulpit
today
give
out
the
truth
They
all
know
there
is
a
life
after
this
but
they
cling
to
the
old
orthodox
belief
Some
are
ready
to
grasp
the
truth
and
some
are
not
I
thank
you
for
helping
me
I
felt
like
saying
I
was
in
hell
because
of
those
electric
sparks
for
I
thought
the
devil
himself
was
after
me
but
I
was
brought
to
a
realization
of
what
I
should
have
done
when
in
life
and
that
I
should
not
obsess
any
one
To
Mrs
H
W
I
also
want
to
thank
you
Mrs
W
for
helping
me
and
to
ask
your
forgiveness
for
having
obsessed
your
daughter
But
I
assure
you
I
did
it
unconsciously
I
did
not
realize
the
laws
that
govern
I
was
not
taught
myself
I
thought
I
was
teaching
my
people
about
the
real
life
but
I
was
not
I
preached
about
Christ
dying
for
our
sins
that
you
must
believe
and
faith
will
make
you
free
That
is
not
so
To
faith
we
must
add
knowledge
and
that
will
make
us
free
so
the
Good
Book
says
I
did
not
preach
that
I
taught
to
faith
add
belief
and
you
will
be
saved
How
very
little
ministers
do
to
help
uplift
people
or
to
give
them
a
right
understanding
of
God
We
always
tell
them
to
believe
believe
We
do
not
want
people
to
have
knowledge
because
then
they
begin
to
ask
questions
that
we
cannot
answer
so
we
tell
them
to
believe
and
have
patience
and
they
will
be
saved
Why
should
we
not
teach
them
the
real
truth
and
have
them
understand
God
and
life
in
the
true
sense
The
time
is
coming
when
the
ministers
cannot
preach
the
old
dogmas
to
the
people
They
will
have
to
change
if
they
want
the
people
to
fill
their
churches
I
know
I
was
not
a
good
minister
I
mean
I
was
not
popular
I
could
never
hold
my
people
because
I
did
not
have
my
whole
heart
and
soul
in
the
work
I
felt
that
we
should
believe
but
at
times
a
strong
power
came
to
me
and
I
felt
that
I
should
have
more
real
knowledge
of
the
life
hereafter
but
I
shut
the
door
to
it
Now
I
am
sorry
that
I
did
not
try
to
investigate
more
When
I
went
out
of
my
body
I
went
so
quickly
that
I
did
not
realize
the
change
You
know
Mrs
W
there
was
quite
a
company
of
us
and
we
were
all
rushing
to
get
home
I
stepped
over
to
the
other
track
and
another
train
which
I
did
not
see
coming
killed
me
I
did
not
even
realize
that
I
was
hurt
When
the
rest
of
them
went
home
I
went
with
them
I
went
to
my
home
but
I
did
not
realize
that
anything
unusual
had
taken
place
I
could
not
understand
things
I
went
first
to
one
then
another
but
nobody
seemed
to
notice
me
It
was
very
queer
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
Where
should
I
go
where
could
I
go
I
went
to
my
church
and
stayed
there
still
I
did
not
realize
that
I
had
passed
out
One
day
Mrs
W
you
came
to
church
In
your
thoughts
of
me
I
saw
a
light
because
I
was
in
darkness
I
did
not
feel
sick
but
I
did
not
feel
quite
myself
so
I
followed
you
to
see
if
I
could
get
an
explanation
When
you
reached
home
suddenly
I
seemed
to
be
closed
up
in
a
room
and
I
was
in
very
close
quarters
Obsessing
Mrs
W
s
daughter
Mrs
A
After
a
while
I
went
to
sleep
I
slept
in
a
way
and
still
I
felt
weak
and
had
such
a
strange
sensation
There
were
several
others
with
me
but
I
cannot
describe
the
condition
except
to
say
that
we
seemed
to
be
in
a
room
too
small
for
us
We
were
all
packed
in
like
sardines
I
could
hardly
get
my
breath
Then
I
fell
asleep
and
I
slept
for
a
long
time
I
did
not
realize
anything
after
that
until
I
got
fire
all
over
my
body
Static
electricity
given
patient
There
seemed
to
be
fire
all
over
me
and
I
could
not
realize
what
it
was
All
I
could
see
was
this
fire
and
how
it
thundered
At
first
I
thought
I
was
really
dead
and
in
hell
because
I
could
not
imagine
anything
else
I
thought
I
a
minister
trying
to
save
people
from
hell
and
here
I
am
right
in
it
myself
Then
I
woke
up
and
there
was
more
fire
but
before
I
knew
it
I
was
alive
again
and
I
could
talk
which
I
could
not
do
before
Having
been
transferred
to
Mrs
Wickland
While
I
did
not
know
I
was
dead
yet
I
felt
I
had
to
come
to
life
again
I
found
I
had
been
brought
to
this
little
circle
for
help
and
I
want
to
thank
you
all
for
waking
me
up
I
have
no
grudge
against
you
for
having
given
me
that
hell
fire
It
helped
me
from
hell
to
Heaven
or
as
we
like
to
call
it
the
spirit
world
I
found
the
hereafter
very
different
from
anything
I
ever
dreamed
of
What
do
we
think
we
ministers
I
want
to
say
that
we
do
not
think
at
all
We
preach
but
we
do
not
practice
We
do
not
realize
what
we
are
doing
when
we
try
to
save
people
save
them
from
what
Since
I
left
you
and
you
gave
me
the
true
understanding
of
life
as
it
is
I
have
seen
much
I
have
learned
much
In
the
three
years
since
I
woke
up
I
do
not
say
three
years
since
I
passed
out
because
the
rest
of
the
time
I
was
in
a
dream
state
but
in
the
three
years
since
I
have
had
an
understanding
of
life
everything
has
been
so
beautiful
and
I
have
been
very
happy
and
busy
I
have
my
hands
full
with
my
work
My
mission
is
to
go
to
the
religious
fanatics
in
the
spirit
world
and
preach
to
them
the
truth
They
are
in
darkness
They
pray
and
sing
and
they
think
that
Christ
died
for
their
sins
All
they
do
is
to
pray
and
sing
and
they
do
not
get
anywhere
There
are
many
people
on
the
earth
plane
who
go
insane
but
they
are
only
controlled
by
crazy
spirits
who
are
religious
fanatics
and
all
they
do
is
sing
and
pray
They
are
wild
Some
I
cannot
reach
some
I
can
turn
to
an
understanding
of
the
higher
life
I
hope
the
time
will
come
when
the
ministers
who
preach
the
gospel
will
preach
a
true
interpretation
of
the
Bible
not
the
one
Orthodoxy
teaches
Mrs
W
I
want
you
to
tell
the
Pastor
of
your
church
that
I
said
he
must
not
hide
his
light
under
a
bushel
but
must
teach
the
truth
He
must
study
and
learn
the
true
lesson
of
life
He
must
give
out
the
truth
to
his
people
Tell
him
I
said
he
can
give
it
out
little
by
little
and
before
he
knows
it
he
will
have
given
them
the
whole
truth
and
he
will
have
many
more
people
attending
his
church
than
he
has
now
People
do
not
believe
now
in
the
old
dogmas
but
they
want
something
the
truth
Tell
him
that
I
wanted
you
to
say
this
to
him
I
have
found
my
home
in
the
spirit
world
and
am
happy
but
I
have
a
great
deal
to
do
I
have
to
undo
the
wrong
teaching
I
gave
to
the
people
when
I
was
on
earth
I
taught
dogma
and
now
I
have
to
give
them
the
truth
Mrs
W
please
forgive
me
for
having
obsessed
your
daughter
I
had
no
intention
of
doing
what
I
did
for
I
did
it
unconsciously
Before
I
go
I
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
Mrs
W
and
that
is
tell
Rev
W
to
study
and
look
into
the
truth
before
he
comes
to
the
spirit
world
so
he
will
not
be
in
darkness
as
I
was
Tell
him
he
can
give
the
truth
to
his
people
because
the
majority
are
ready
for
it
It
is
very
monotonous
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
old
time
dogmas
over
and
over
again
Tell
him
I
said
if
he
does
not
do
this
people
will
leave
his
church
He
is
a
good
speaker
and
a
good
man
and
if
he
teaches
the
real
truth
as
he
will
find
it
if
he
studies
he
will
have
many
followers
but
if
he
keeps
on
with
the
old
doctrine
he
will
not
have
many
attending
his
church
If
he
interests
his
congregation
and
has
a
revival
meeting
to
tell
them
he
has
found
the
real
truth
he
will
see
things
will
soon
be
different
Nearly
every
one
in
his
church
has
been
to
some
Spiritualist
meeting
They
want
the
truth
so
tell
him
to
give
it
to
them
Tell
him
the
old
people
in
the
Home
should
be
rightly
taught
because
they
will
soon
come
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
it
is
better
that
they
should
know
about
the
land
they
are
going
to
The
young
men
of
the
present
day
do
not
want
to
be
orthodox
ministers
They
want
other
doctrines
They
know
the
old
dogma
is
not
the
real
truth
and
they
do
not
want
to
preach
contrary
to
their
knowledge
There
are
not
many
applications
for
the
ministry
now
Tell
Rev
W
if
he
will
preach
the
truth
he
will
have
many
young
people
in
his
church
Tell
him
to
present
the
ideas
of
the
founder
of
his
church
John
Wesley
the
founder
of
the
Methodist
Church
lectured
on
spirit
phenomena
All
he
has
to
do
is
to
present
Wesley
s
doctrine
Now
I
must
go
Good
Night
CHAPTER
XIV
Christian
Science
THE
domination
of
any
one
fixed
opinion
to
the
exclusion
of
further
mental
growth
holds
the
spirit
in
a
state
of
nonprogression
as
has
been
attested
by
intelligences
who
on
earth
had
held
strongly
to
the
Christian
Science
teaching
regarding
the
non
existence
of
matter
and
who
have
told
of
the
difficulties
encountered
in
freeing
themselves
A
friend
of
ours
had
been
a
deep
student
of
Christian
Science
and
at
the
same
time
an
investigator
of
the
facts
concerning
spirit
return
Shortly
after
he
had
passed
away
he
was
brought
to
our
circle
to
be
awakened
through
controlling
Mrs
Wickland
and
has
since
told
us
something
of
the
conditions
in
the
spirit
world

MR
H

Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
am
pleased
to
come
here
again
I
felt
that
I
must
take
advantage
of
this
evening
to
say
something
to
my
dear
wife
present
in
the
circle
I
am
so
glad
I
can
talk
to
her
as
we
always
talked
I
am
happy
she
is
here
God
bless
you
my
wife
We
were
so
happy
together
I
would
not
care
to
come
back
here
at
all
if
it
were
not
that
she
is
still
on
earth
This
world
is
only
a
school
where
we
gain
understanding
through
experience
In
the
spirit
world
we
go
on
and
on
progressing
but
before
we
can
progress
we
must
have
understanding
of
the
spiritual
laws
If
we
have
not
the
right
understanding
then
we
remain
in
darkness
and
hover
around
the
earth
plane
I
am
pleased
that
I
had
even
a
little
knowledge
of
the
higher
life
for
when
I
reached
there
my
spiritual
eyes
were
open
and
I
could
see
and
realize
the
beauties
of
the
spirit
world
I
have
met
many
of
my
dear
friends
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
Many
whom
I
knew
are
still
in
darkness
and
I
have
tried
to
help
them
understand
their
transition
If
I
could
only
express
the
conditions
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
so
that
you
would
get
the
full
meaning
There
is
such
beauty
such
harmony
I
have
to
thank
little
Silver
Star
one
of
Mrs
Wickland
s
guides
for
having
awakened
me
when
I
reached
the
other
side
Even
with
my
knowledge
of
the
other
world
I
might
have
slept
a
long
time
because
when
I
passed
out
I
was
in
a
heavy
sleep
from
an
opiate
which
was
given
me
on
account
of
the
nature
of
my
sickness
But
this
little
Indian
girl
called
me
by
name
and
woke
me
up
and
brought
me
to
the
spirit
world
You
know
I
had
been
sick
for
a
long
time
and
I
was
very
sick
before
I
passed
out
I
made
my
mistake
in
trying
for
so
long
to
cure
myself
Christian
Science
says
we
should
overcome
matter
We
cannot
overcome
matter
by
will
When
we
are
in
the
physical
body
and
the
body
needs
certain
forces
of
which
it
is
made
if
we
do
not
get
them
in
our
food
we
must
get
them
through
medicine
and
so
build
up
the
body
because
will
cannot
conquer
substance
God
has
given
us
a
will
to
use
as
a
force
in
Nature
and
we
should
use
it
rightly
When
as
Scientists
we
refuse
to
do
this
we
must
suffer
the
consequences
I
was
an
example
of
such
a
consequence
I
went
into
Science
with
full
will
power
and
full
faith
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
matter
and
that
we
should
overcome
it
I
tried
and
failed
Mrs
Eddy
is
suffering
now
for
advancing
that
idea
When
you
have
a
dress
that
is
wearing
out
you
try
to
get
some
material
of
the
same
color
and
quality
with
which
to
mend
the
dress
We
do
not
do
that
with
our
bodies
We
think
the
body
should
develop
the
substance
it
needs
when
it
wears
out
I
did
not
get
enough
elements
in
my
food
to
build
up
my
physical
body
my
organs
became
atrophied
and
sluggish
and
were
inactive
because
I
did
not
take
the
right
food
to
give
them
proper
activity
I
should
have
gone
to
a
physician
to
have
them
put
in
normal
condition
but
instead
I
tried
to
use
my
will
to
make
them
work
I
tried
by
intelligence
to
overcome
and
build
up
the
weak
part
of
my
body
That
is
just
as
if
one
refused
to
mend
a
worn
place
in
a
dress
insisting
that
no
hole
could
come
in
that
dress
I
was
just
as
foolish
about
my
body
and
I
had
to
suffer
the
results
When
the
body
needs
toning
up
we
must
do
something
to
tone
it
up
and
to
get
the
electric
forces
set
right
I
passed
out
because
I
wore
out
my
body
with
my
mind
and
did
not
feed
it
or
take
sufficient
care
of
it
God
gave
us
our
bodies
and
He
also
gave
us
minds
to
take
care
of
them
If
we
become
one
sided
and
think
mind
is
all
then
we
get
into
trouble
I
took
good
care
of
my
clothes
but
how
little
I
took
care
of
my
body
If
I
had
paid
half
as
much
attention
to
my
body
as
I
did
to
my
clothes
I
feel
that
I
would
have
been
on
earth
today
Probably
some
day
things
will
be
so
understood
that
there
will
be
no
death
I
mean
that
we
will
merely
step
out
of
the
physical
body
into
the
spirit
world
If
one
would
prepare
himself
for
passing
out
of
the
body
as
he
does
for
a
journey
he
would
be
able
to
say
Now
I
am
ready
to
go
I
am
through
with
this
world
It
is
time
for
me
to
go
and
I
want
to
go
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
Then
there
would
be
no
dread
Many
Christian
Scientists
ruin
their
bodies
by
lack
of
right
care
and
often
go
as
far
as
I
did
they
use
will
no
reason
and
take
improper
nourishment
or
not
enough
I
knew
about
ten
years
ago
that
I
should
attend
to
my
inactive
organs
If
I
had
had
them
attended
to
I
would
not
have
suffered
as
I
did
I
suffered
a
great
deal
and
I
used
my
will
to
make
inactive
parts
act
I
should
have
liked
to
remain
on
earth
long
enough
to
do
the
work
I
felt
I
should
do
but
I
will
do
the
work
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
when
my
wife
comes
we
will
work
together
My
dear
wife
if
I
had
thought
less
of
mental
or
Christian
Science
and
given
more
thought
to
the
material
side
of
things
then
you
would
be
in
a
better
position
than
you
are
now
I
really
lost
all
thought
of
things
material
and
I
guess
I
thought
we
could
live
on
air
and
I
always
thought
conditions
would
change
some
time
I
did
not
realize
I
was
so
hypnotized
in
my
work
that
I
hardly
lived
in
the
material
world
If
it
had
not
been
for
my
wife
I
think
that
sometimes
I
would
have
forgotten
that
I
should
eat
at
all
I
thank
God
she
was
not
so
deeply
interested
in
the
work
as
I
because
then
there
might
be
two
dead
people
Before
leaving
I
must
tell
you
of
a
little
experience
When
I
passed
out
I
was
awakened
by
hearing
somebody
say
How
do
you
do
I
listened
and
once
again
I
heard
the
quaint
voice
of
my
little
friend
Silver
Star
Then
I
thought
I
must
be
in
California
because
I
remembered
that
Dr
Wickland
and
his
wife
were
there
and
I
thought
that
Silver
Star
was
speaking
through
Mrs
Wickland
Nobody
says
How
do
you
do
like
Silver
Star
I
did
not
realize
that
I
had
passed
out
of
my
body
Again
I
heard
Silver
Star
say
How
do
you
do
in
her
strange
way
and
then
I
began
to
wonder
where
I
was
All
at
once
I
seemed
to
be
alive
again
Then
I
felt
better
I
thought
I
must
have
gone
through
the
crisis
of
my
sickness
and
now
I
am
feeling
better
and
am
waking
up
That
was
the
time
Silver
Star
brought
me
in
to
control
Mrs
Wickland
I
realized
that
I
was
weak
from
my
sickness
but
having
no
pain
I
thought
I
was
getting
better
I
felt
so
light
and
strong
that
my
first
thought
was
that
I
could
finish
my
book
but
when
I
really
came
to
myself
I
heard
Dr
Wickland
talking
to
me
Then
I
thought
Well
how
did
I
get
to
California
How
did
I
get
here
I
must
be
dreaming
It
was
some
time
before
I
realized
where
I
was
I
did
not
even
then
realize
that
I
was
controlling
Doctor
asked
me
who
I
was
I
thought
it
strange
that
he
did
not
know
me
but
I
told
him
that
I
was
Mr
M
and
asked
whether
he
did
not
know
me
Doctor
was
very
much
surprised
and
explained
as
gently
as
he
could
that
I
had
passed
out
of
my
mortal
body
a
week
before
and
was
now
a
spirit
That
was
the
first
time
I
realized
that
I
had
passed
out
of
my
physical
body
into
a
spiritual
body
It
was
very
pleasant
to
think
that
I
had
wakened
in
a
mortal
body
instead
of
in
darkness
Afterwards
I
saw
many
of
my
friends
and
I
felt
that
there
is
no
death
Doctor
talked
to
me
for
a
while
and
then
my
father
mother
sister
and
brother
all
came
to
me
and
they
brought
many
relatives
and
friends
and
we
had
a
happy
reunion
one
that
can
never
be
forgotten
Only
I
wanted
you
my
wife
to
be
with
me
when
I
met
all
my
relatives
and
friends
When
I
realized
that
I
was
using
an
earthly
body
I
felt
sick
again
and
my
will
power
seemed
to
fail
me
I
began
to
feel
very
weak
and
a
sensation
of
sickness
came
over
me
I
at
once
thought
of
my
little
friend
Silver
Star
and
she
said
I
must
throw
away
my
old
clothes
because
I
had
no
use
for
my
old
body
for
I
had
new
clothes
now
When
I
thought
of
my
spiritual
body
I
arose
I
felt
I
had
new
clothes
and
I
received
strength
and
left
the
physical
altogether
The
magnetic
current
was
cut
and
I
dropped
my
old
clothes
entirely
I
was
then
lifted
bodily
so
it
seemed
and
I
felt
I
was
floating
and
we
went
through
conditions
of
all
kinds
I
felt
so
strange
and
saw
so
much
that
I
grew
fearful
so
they
told
me
to
shut
my
eyes
and
keep
them
shut
which
I
did
I
did
not
know
anything
after
that
until
they
placed
me
on
a
beautiful
bed
I
was
very
tired
and
all
I
wanted
was
to
rest
just
rest
When
I
awoke
from
that
sleep
of
rest
my
relatives
and
friends
were
around
me
Somebody
said
Now
you
are
well
and
strong
and
we
will
take
a
journey
to
our
home
in
the
spirit
world
We
went
to
many
of
their
homes
Each
had
a
little
home
We
were
united
and
happy
for
here
only
harmony
exists
We
traveled
from
one
place
to
another
When
I
had
been
to
visit
quite
a
few
friends
they
said
Now
you
have
seen
the
spirit
side
of
life
Here
we
are
not
idle
This
is
not
a
world
in
which
one
is
idle
it
is
a
world
of
busy
minds
It
is
each
one
s
duty
to
work
Now
you
are
strong
and
we
will
take
another
journey
to
earth
I
wanted
to
see
my
wife
so
much
You
were
in
my
mind
so
much
my
wife
and
I
wanted
to
see
you
We
passed
through
the
spirit
world
and
earth
sphere
to
matter
again
The
earth
is
a
little
globe
The
globe
has
a
sphere
around
it
The
distance
between
the
spirit
world
and
the
world
of
matter
is
about
sixty
miles
This
sphere
is
the
world
of
the
spirits
in
darkness
Christ
went
to
the
spirits
in
darkness
and
prison
the
prison
of
ignorance
We
passed
through
conditions
that
cannot
be
described
the
most
hideous
the
most
fiendish
so
ugly
that
I
cannot
describe
them
It
made
me
shudder
to
see
the
condition
of
the
crippled
minds
the
selfish
minds
the
jealous
minds
Each
had
the
countenance
of
his
mind
They
were
dressed
as
when
on
earth
but
only
because
of
their
minds
They
were
like
vermin
They
were
like
a
lot
of
worms
stirred
up
and
crawling
over
one
another
Talk
about
hell
that
surely
was
hell
They
told
me
that
was
the
earthbound
sphere
Then
we
came
to
matter
again
We
saw
the
people
walking
around
in
a
life
of
matter
each
one
in
some
kind
of
business
It
looked
like
a
world
of
ants
and
each
one
seemed
to
have
some
of
these
evil
minded
spirits
clinging
to
him
They
are
like
the
barnacles
on
boats
some
are
shaken
off
but
others
come
on
I
cannot
describe
the
sight
I
have
been
with
you
my
wife
You
have
felt
me
I
could
not
impress
you
because
I
was
not
strong
enough
to
use
my
mind
for
that
purpose
but
still
you
have
felt
me
It
has
only
been
a
little
because
I
had
not
strength
enough
to
come
closer
I
am
with
you
a
great
deal
After
I
learn
in
spirit
how
to
overcome
matter
then
I
can
come
to
you
and
help
you
I
will
build
a
home
for
you
in
the
spirit
world
and
when
that
home
is
finished
and
your
work
here
is
done
then
I
shall
be
the
one
to
meet
you
and
we
will
have
a
real
home
I
want
to
thank
you
all
for
the
privilege
of
coming
to
your
little
circle
and
would
like
to
come
again
some
other
time
An

line
of

MR
H
M
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
wish
that
I
had
had
less
belief
that
I
could
cure
myself
by
thought
Everything
that
God
has
put
in
Nature
is
for
man
to
use
not
misuse
We
should
not
condemn
anything
that
God
has
given
the
world
to
use
but
we
have
so
many
beliefs
and
creeds
that
we
forget
the
principle
of
our
Maker
If
we
would
understand
His
wonderful
work
through
Nature
we
would
love
others
better
than
we
do
Do
not
condemn
anything
but
teach
men
and
women
to
love
each
other
teach
them
to
know
what
their
duties
are
in
this
mundane
sphere
Those
on
earth
have
so
many
creeds
and
fads
that
they
drown
themselves
in
their
faith
forgetting
that
it
is
their
duty
to
help
the
weak
ones
instead
of
stepping
on
their
feet
So
it
is
also
with
the
body
God
gave
us
to
take
care
of
and
not
misuse
For
my
part
I
should
have
done
more
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
with
me
instead
of
only
thinking
there
was
nothing
the
matter
that
I
only
imagined
it
and
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
sickness
If
I
had
not
hypnotized
myself
in
that
belief
of
Mrs
Eddy
s
that
mind
should
overcome
matter
and
that
it
is
only
our
mortal
mind
that
is
so
called
sick
and
we
have
not
the
right
understanding
if
I
had
tried
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
with
me
and
called
on
some
physician
one
who
had
studied
anatomy
and
the
philosophy
of
life
one
who
had
spent
years
in
studying
human
nature
and
the
human
body
I
should
have
been
better
off
Christian
Scientists
condemn
physicians
yet
physicians
have
devoted
their
lives
through
centuries
to
the
study
and
control
of
all
sickness
Should
we
condemn
them
and
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sickness
Why
should
anybody
condemn
another
who
has
devoted
his
whole
life
to
study
Christian
Science
says
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sickness
and
that
you
are
not
in
the
understanding
Suppose
that
in
olden
times
we
had
held
the
theory
that
there
is
no
matter
How
about
Harvey
He
discovered
the
circulation
of
the
blood
Poor
man
He
was
killed
because
of
his
discovery
he
was
killed
by
ignorant
people
who
did
not
believe
the
truth
So
one
thing
after
another
has
been
discovered
in
human
anatomy
Yet
Christian
Scientists
discard
that
altogether
and
also
say
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
body
I
did
not
take
care
of
the
body
that
God
gave
me
I
thought
mind
should
overcome
it
If
I
had
consulted
a
physician
I
might
even
be
with
you
today
Do
not
let
yourselves
be
hypnotized
by
ideas
Every
theory
has
some
good
in
it
but
let
us
take
the
good
and
discard
the
rest
As
Mrs
Eddy
now
sees
these
things
she
wishes
she
could
correct
many
of
her
statements
She
now
has
to
suffer
for
her
mistakes
and
it
is
very
hard
for
her
Her
followers
come
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
expect
to
find
things
as
she
taught
them
Mrs
Eddy
herself
has
spoken
in
our
circle
several
times
and
has
brought
invisible
audiences
which
she
endeavored
to
free
from
the
misconceptions
acquired
from
her
teachings
relating
to
the
problems
of
life
and
matter

Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
am
here
again
and
I
feel
so
sad
Do
not
doubt
me
do
not
doubt
me
Why
will
people
doubt
me
Help
me
God
help
me
I
am
in
a
terrible
condition
I
knew
about
the
wonderful
truth
of
the
life
beyond
I
knew
it
well
while
in
life
but
I
shut
the
door
because
I
wanted
a
religion
of
my
own
Spiritualism
belonged
to
the
past
days
I
wanted
something
new
something
higher
something
better
than
spirit
return
I
taught
that
you
must
not
let
any
entities
control
you
or
influence
you
or
give
you
any
inspiration
but
that
you
must
be
Yourself
and
develop
yourself
and
be
one
with
the
Infinite
Shut
the
door
to
the
spirit
world
and
be
selfish
that
was
I
I
had
the
truth
of
healing
the
sick
I
was
a
medium
and
in
my
younger
days
my
childhood
I
was
obsessed
As
I
grew
older
no
one
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
me
for
I
had
such
queer
spells
Now
I
know
what
it
was
an
influence
was
controlling
me
whenever
I
had
the
spells
I
was
of
a
very
nervous
temperament
and
I
was
cured
of
those
spells
by
Dr
Quimby
He
believed
in
the
work
of
obsession
I
took
some
of
his
doctrine
and
used
it
for
my
own
The
doctrine
would
have
been
all
right
if
I
had
not
denied
the
finer
forces
in
Nature
I
denied
matter
but
friends
as
I
told
you
one
time
I
had
a
vision
and
I
saw
how
they
treated
patients
in
the
other
world
but
at
that
time
I
thought
it
was
a
dream
They
were
teaching
the
spirits
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
matter
They
said
Forget
it
is
is
only
imagination
You
are
not
sick
you
just
imagine
it
That
belongs
to
matter
That
is
only
your
mortal
mind
You
should
overcome
and
develop
the
spirit
within
you
I
thought
that
this
vision
meant
that
I
was
to
teach
that
on
earth
and
I
set
to
work
Now
I
see
my
mistake
because
there
is
matter
and
so
long
as
you
live
on
the
material
plane
you
will
have
to
recognize
matter
When
you
reach
the
spirit
side
of
life
your
mind
has
to
be
taught
to
overcome
matter
not
cling
to
it
because
spirits
in
darkness
are
clinging
to
matter
as
much
as
we
cling
to
matter
when
we
have
our
physical
bodies
I
took
this
and
taught
it
and
started
on
my
work
It
was
so
misunderstood
because
I
could
not
myself
explain
why
matter
was
not
If
only
I
could
get
people
to
recognize
matter
and
recognize
the
truth
of
life
after
this
If
I
could
only
go
back
to
my
Church
and
teach
the
truth
the
genuine
Truth
of
God
God
is
the
Spirit
of
the
Universe
and
we
are
a
part
of
that
Great
Spirit
Understanding
this
we
can
overcome
matter
You
are
in
the
material
body
and
you
become
sick
You
become
sick
because
there
is
a
lack
of
something
in
your
body
which
you
must
have
some
element
that
helps
in
some
way
or
another
But
your
mind
can
help
to
overcome
If
I
had
taught
that
instead
of
denying
matter
altogether
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
I
wanted
money
and
we
concentrated
to
have
the
grandest
churches
in
the
world
My
aim
was
to
have
churches
of
my
own
teaching
all
over
the
universe
I
lost
the
opportunity
to
develop
people
s
finer
nature
the
finer
nature
of
men
and
women
because
I
shut
the
door
of
love
and
sympathy
Do
not
doubt
who
this
is
do
not
doubt
me
I
am
here
I
am
here
I
am
no
more
than
any
human
being
Mine
was
a
life
which
did
not
do
what
it
ought
I
want
to
be
helped
My
people
come
to
me
and
want
help
and
I
need
help
myself
They
cling
to
me
and
hold
me
down
and
I
shut
the
door
for
their
happiness
We
have
only
one
mind
You
understand
where
I
got
the
mortal
mind
part
from
I
thought
that
should
be
taught
here
but
it
should
only
be
taught
beyond
the
grave
beyond
the
veil
and
only
to
the
earthbound
spirits
who
are
in
darkness
and
cling
to
matter
That
should
be
taught
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
not
on
the
earth
plane
Have
love
and
sympathy
and
do
the
very
best
you
know
how
for
others
I
could
not
leave
this
matter
alone
and
I
do
not
feel
that
I
should
because
it
crushes
me
so
I
came
to
this
circle
because
so
many
have
been
helped
here
I
go
from
one
place
to
another
and
you
will
hear
of
me
at
different
intervals
because
I
can
explain
to
a
few
at
each
place
and
in
that
way
people
will
wake
up
We
cannot
do
much
yet
but
will
you
allow
me
to
come
here
once
in
a
while
when
I
see
I
can
be
helped
You
know
I
have
so
many
people
who
hold
me
down
and
say
Why
did
you
teach
this
Why
did
you
shut
the
door
for
us
Give
us
light
give
us
light
and
understanding
So
many
people
are
here
but
they
cling
to
matter
So
many
of
my
people
are
here
and
in
talking
with
you
I
talk
to
them
You
understand
I
knew
the
real
truth
but
I
shut
the
door
I
cannot
open
the
door
to
many
of
my
followers
because
I
shut
the
door
for
them
and
closed
the
door
for
myself
and
when
they
pass
out
the
door
is
closed
They
want
me
to
help
them
and
when
I
explain
things
to
them
in
the
true
light
they
doubt
me
and
say
that
I
am
not
Mrs
Eddy
because
she
did
not
preach
such
lessons
I
thank
you
for
giving
me
this
little
time
Tonight
many
of
my
followers
came
with
me
and
through
my
talk
to
you
they
will
be
helped
Their
subconsciousness
which
is
asleep
must
be
awakened
Question
Is
the
little
pamphlet
recently
published
called
Confession
by
Mrs
Eddy
from
the
Spirit
World
authentic
Spirit
Certainly
it
is
I
am
trying
through
every
avenue
to
speak
I
am
not
going
to
stop
here
I
will
take
advantage
of
every
chance
there
is
for
me
to
tell
the
truth
and
reach
my
people
You
may
hear
from
others
that
I
have
talked
with
them
I
will
bring
up
the
above
subject
here
and
there
People
doubt
me
now
but
I
shall
keep
on
I
will
not
rest
We
will
have
centers
for
the
work
I
want
you
here
to
help
me
spread
the
news
not
much
just
a
little
thought
now
and
then
will
help
I
will
get
my
people
together
and
bring
them
here
and
talk
to
them
if
I
may
come
once
in
a
while
for
I
can
reach
them
more
easily
when
I
control
a
mortal
body
God
bless
you
all
and
again
I
thank
you
for
the
privilege
of
having
this
opportunity
of
speaking
to
some
of
my
people
and
helping
them
Further
evidence
of
the
fact
that
Mrs
Eddy
when
on
earth
knew
the
truth
regarding
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
the
earthbound
condition
is
found
in
one
of
the
early
editions
of
the
Christian
Science
text
book
in
the
chapter
on
The
Science
of
Being
If
the
Principle
rule
and
demonstration
of
Being
are
not
in
the
least
understood
before
what
is
termed
death
overtakes
mortals
they
will
rise
no
higher
in
the
scale
of
existence
at
that
single
point
of
experience
but
will
remain
as
material
as
before
the
transition
still
seeking
happiness
through
a
material
instead
of
through
a
spiritual
sense
of
Life
and
from
selfish
and
inferior
motives
So
long
as
the
error
or
belief
lasts
that
life
and
mind
are
finite
and
physical
and
are
manifested
through
brain
and
nerves
so
long
the
penalty
of
sickness
sin
and
death
will
continue
To
the
other
the
spiritual
class
relates
the
scripture
On
such
the
second
death
hath
no
power
A
spirit
who
had
become
fanatical
over
the
Christian
Science
teachings
was
brought
in
by
Mrs
Eddy
as
an
example
of
the
difficulties
which
she
encountered
in
the
work
of
enlightening
her
followers

think
if

Bible

had
acquired
an
understanding

real
mystery
of

it
would
have

should
come
down

such
common
clay
as
we
are

I
suppose
I
have
come

to
do
some

work

should

high

seem
to
have
gone

far

passed
beyond

mind

go
back

hurts

come
down
to
mortal
mind
again
doesn
t
it
There
is
an
old
saying
that
What
goes
up
must
come
down

What
kind

We
are
just
common
sense

just
beautiful
Bliss
and
Harmony
Dr
How
did
you
happen
to
come
here
Sp
I
suppose
I
came
to
be
your
teacher
Dr
You
spoke
of
going
forward
and
that
God
is
All
in
All
Is
He
within
you

I
am
one
with
the
Infinite
I
am
in
love
with
the
Lord
and

You
people
here
are
still
in
your
mortal
caskets
You
do
not
know
anything
Dr
That
is
a
very
elaborate
statement
Sp
We
have
to
overcome
it
is
just
an
error
Dr
On
your
part
or
ours
Sp
I
must
help
you
to
climb
higher
I
came
to
be
a
teacher
to
you
all
to
help
you
to
understand
and
become
one
with
the
Infinite
Dr
Probably
an
exchange
of
ideas
might
be
helpful
SP
I
do
not
need
any
teaching
I
am
one
with
the
All
in
All
Dr
What
do
scientists
think
will
happen
when
they
die

They

I
do
not

argue
with

Dr
Who
died
first
you
or
Mrs
Eddy
Sp
With
asperity
I
will
not
answer
your
questions
Dr
I
did
not
think

malicious

died

years
ago

Her
teachings
were

will
go

mortal
casket

Infinite
Dr
How
long

only
left
my
mortal
casket

was

fine
practitioner

How

I
am
not

intelligent
spirits
have
brought

helped

was
so
wrapped

else

taken

wanted

one
demonstration

Referring

contact
matter

shut

want
you

let
me
come

extend
help
to

speaking
through

earth
things
would
be
different
I
knew
I
had
the
truth
We
should
unite
and
be
one
strong
body
because
I
know
there
is
power
in
concentration
and
I
only
wish
that
I
could
have
the
whole
world
understand
this
doctrine
If
I
could
only
come
back
and
tell
my
people
what
I
now
have
to
do
You
saw
the
demonstration
you
had
here
tonight
I
asked
the
Band
of
Mercy
to
bring
one
of
my
followers
in
to
show
what
I
have
to
deal
with
With
this
one
we
could
probably
demonstrate
to
a
hundred
similar
spirits
the
folly
of
the
mortal
mind
idea
Concentrate
your
mind
over
and
over
again
and
again
round
and
round
and
read
and
read
that
was
the
way
I
taught
one
was
to
reach
understanding
I
said
my
followers
should
read
my
books
and
read
them
and
read
them
until
they
became
second
nature
When
you
are
in
matter
the
mind
has
to
have
some
food
But
when
my
people
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
matter
is
no
more
and
they
have
thrown
off
the
mortal
error
you
see
just
where
they
are
What
can
I
do
with
them
How
much
could
you
do
with
them
under
similar
circumstances
There
is
my
work
and
more
is
coming
Every
day
there
are
more
and
more
people
coming
I
try
to
help
them
because
I
taught
mortal
error
and
did
not
teach
the
truth
I
feel
so
sad
and
I
do
wish
I
could
tell
them
to
open
the
door
for
the
spirit
of
understanding
and
not
keep
on
just
reading
and
reading
and
concentrating
In
every
church
all
over
the
United
States
where
we
have
churches
they
use
the
same
lesson
on
the
same
Sunday
They
form
a
circle
round
and
round
and
you
must
know
they
form
a
very
strong
magnet
and
draw
people
into
the
same
condition
When
they
come
here
they
cling
to
me
cling
to
me
so
closely
and
what
am
I
to
do
If
I
tell
them
the
common
sense
things
I
should
have
taught
them
they
will
not
believe
I
knew
I
had
the
real
truth
and
I
had
power
but
I
was
selfish
I
wanted
to
have
a
religion
of
my
own
I
wanted
one
that
the
whole
world
should
know
What
have
I
now
When
my
people
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
the
door
is
closed
and
I
cannot
open
it
What
progress
could
you
make
with
the
spirit
you
had
here
tonight
I
thank
the
Mercy
Band
and
all
of
you
here
because
through
this
experience
we
took
this
spirit
to
the
spirit
world
and
they
will
teach
her
through
object
lessons
There
were
many
Scientists
here
tonight
and
they
saw
how
foolish
it
all
is
their
eyes
were
opened
and
the
spirit
friends
took
them
away
with
them
The
one
here
we
could
not
do
much
with
but
she
was
an
object
lesson
to
teach
the
others
and
in
time
she
will
be
helped
My
people
read
and
read
and
the
majority
come
over
here
without
any
understanding
I
closed
the
door
for
my
people
and
it
is
hard
It
is
easy
for
them
so
long
as
they
are
in
the
mortal
body
but
when
they
have
lost
the
mortal
body
they
see
nothing
For
them
there
is
no
spirit
world
it
is
all
Infinite
I
taught
them
to
close
the
door
to
the
spirit
world
and
I
taught
them
to
read
only
my
books
I
wanted
a
religion
of
my
own
I
was
a
trance
medium
and
I
gave
readings
but
I
must
confess
I
felt
that
was
too
common
I
wanted
to
reach
more
intelligent
people
because
I
found
that
Spiritualism
would
not
reach
the
people
I
wanted
to
reach
so
I
took
Quimby
s
doctrine
and
also
as
I
told
you
previously
the
vision
I
had
of
mortal
mind
in
the
spirit
world
and
combined
the
two
I
want
it
understood
that
I
used
to
give
readings
in
Boston
I
was
very
selfish
and
wanted
to
be
somebody
and
have
some
kind
of
a
religion
where
I
could
have
a
following
I
wished
once
that
on
my
birthday
church
bells
all
over
the
United
States
would
ring
and
before
I
died
I
had
that
wish
I
wanted
to
be
one
that
would
be
looked
up
to
I
was
brought
up
in
such
orthodoxy
that
I
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
any
of
the
churches
I
went
into
Spiritualism
first
and
found
that
was
much
better
than
Orthodoxy
so
I
followed
it
for
some
years
but
I
felt
I
could
not
get
very
far
with
it
and
in
the
end
I
was
obsessed
What
I
saw
in
visions
I
put
in
Science
and
Health
That
book
was
written
through
the
visions
I
had
It
was
not
from
my
own
brain
If
only
with
that
I
had
given
the
truth
which
my
brother
wanted
me
to
he
was
in
the
spirit
world
but
I
would
not
I
did
things
Albert
brother
said
I
should
not
do
and
I
closed
the
door
for
him
During
the
last
of
my
days
I
was
not
myself
very
much
All
through
life
I
was
back
and
forth
on
the
invisible
plane
You
know
I
was
a
psychic
and
I
could
have
been
a
very
good
one
and
have
done
more
good
to
the
world
through
my
psychic
power
than
I
did
At
the
last
I
was
too
obsessed
to
be
responsible
for
all
I
was
doing
If
I
had
used
my
psychic
power
I
could
have
helped
thousands
Now
I
have
to
deal
with
what
you
saw
here
tonight
So
long
as
my
people
are
in
the
mortal
body
they
are
all
right
but
once
the
body
is
lost
things
go
round
and
round
My
followers
are
in
just
as
bad
a
condition
as
are
those
who
followed
orthodoxy
When
they
pass
out
of
the
body
everything
they
see
is
mortal
mind
Possibly
you
felt
sorry
you
did
not
convert
the
spirit
you
had
here
tonight
but
while
not
successful
with
her
hundreds
of
others
were
converted
through
seeing
how
foolish
it
all
is
and
were
helped
through
your
talk
This
room
was
crowded
with
people
and
I
hope
you
will
all
be
liberal
enough
to
never
shut
the
door
for
the
beautiful
truth
of
spirit
return
I
bless
you
all
and
give
you
my
solid
support
and
help
and
I
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
bring
more
unfortunate
ones
sometime
I
thank
you
for
keeping
the
door
open
for
me
to
come
I
am
only
mortal
and
I
am
not
of
the
Real
Infinite
either
We
all
have
our
ups
and
downs
here
as
well
as
on
the
other
side
of
life
People
think
that
they
change
their
condition
when
they
die
but
they
do
not
My
people
are
especially
fixed
because
everything
with
them
outside
of
themselves
is
mortal
mind
and
their
own
mind
is
Infinite
Many
who
were
followers
of
my
Church
have
gone
into
New
Thought
From
New
Thought
they
come
into
a
more
spiritual
understanding
New
Thought
is
more
liberal
In
New
Thought
they
branch
out
and
being
liberal
will
look
into
spirit
return
They
are
more
liberal
in
their
reading
of
books
I
forbade
my
people
to
read
anything
but
Science
books
That
was
because
of
my
selfishness
I
wanted
a
church
of
my
own
with
my
people
under
my
thumb
How
I
do
wish
I
had
taught
obsession
which
I
knew
was
true
but
I
did
not
When
I
used
to
go
into
trances
I
wrote
a
great
deal
and
when
I
came
to
myself
I
would
deny
what
I
got
I
was
obsessed
by
some
spirit
who
wanted
me
to
do
such
work
and
I
could
not
really
help
myself
If
I
had
written
the
books
as
they
were
given
to
me
and
credited
their
source
I
might
have
revolutionized
the
world
I
again
want
to
thank
you
and
hope
I
can
come
another
time
I
also
want
to
thank
you
lady
Mrs
M
mentioned
in
the
first
experience
of
this
chapter
because
your
husband
helped
me
in
the
very
beginning
In
the
spirit
world
He
was
one
that
helped
me
to
a
better
understanding
and
brought
me
here
where
I
could
get
help
I
hope
you
will
have
all
the
success
you
wish
Concentrate
your
mind
on
success
and
have
no
fear
that
you
will
not
succeed
and
all
over
the
world
will
spread
this
wonderful
truth
of
spirit
return
and
obsession
and
through
your
obsession
work
you
will
cure
many
more
people
than
I
did
In
our
work
often
when
a
healing
was
instantaneous
it
was
an
obsession
being
relieved
You
understand
also
that
all
the
healers
are
in
the
circle
of
concentration
with
the
power
of
the
whole
church
to
aid
them
and
that
power
of
concentration
is
so
strong
that
an
obsession
cannot
live
in
that
atmosphere
Many
I
cured
were
obsessed
but
they
concentrated
that
they
were
not
sick
How
are
they
helped
I
will
tell
you
The
average
doctor
tells
a
patient
that
he
has
such
and
such
a
sickness
He
creates
a
fear
in
his
mind
Let
us
take
a
case
of
gall
stones
It
is
very
hard
to
diagnose
such
a
case
correctly
The
doctor
says
the
patient
has
gall
stones
sometimes
he
operates
when
that
should
not
be
done
Sometimes
the
patient
gets
well
without
an
operation
That
is
due
to
his
mind
He
concentrates
his
mind
on
gall
stones
gall
stones
until
he
can
think
of
nothing
else
You
understand
you
have
in
your
mind
a
creative
power
We
have
a
spark
of
the
Infinite
within
us
In
that
Divine
spark
God
created
the
world
all
in
it
and
you
as
a
part
Each
of
us
has
much
of
that
creative
power
and
when
you
set
your
mind
working
with
that
power
you
create
your
condition
When
you
go
to
one
of
my
practitioners
the
first
thing
that
is
done
is
to
take
your
mind
off
your
sickness
You
are
given
absent
treatment
to
get
rid
of
fear
You
have
the
same
creative
power
within
yourself
In
a
case
of
diphtheria
the
mind
can
help
but
we
cannot
kill
germs
There
are
many
things
we
fail
in
but
we
have
success
with
chronic
cases
We
have
more
success
because
so
many
are
obsessed
When
you
have
fear
you
are
negative
I
will
be
with
you
to
teach
obsession
to
the
world
Teach
the
real
truth
and
do
not
care
for
people
s
opinions
If
only
I
could
go
to
my
Mother
Church
and
teach
them
the
truth
Thank
you
each
and
every
one
of
you
and
sometime
I
shall
come
again
That
the
mind
has
power
to
create
the
condition
in
which
a
spirit
finds
itself
after
transition
is
illustrated
in
the
following
experience
A
former
patient
of
ours
Mrs
Anna
R
who
had
at
one
time
been
under
our
care
and
had
been
entirely
restored
to
health
many
years
later
left
her
home
to
care
for
a
sister
in
law
Mrs
Jessie
R
who
was
very
ill
The
latter
was
a
Christian
Scientist
and
denied
that
spirit
obsession
had
been
the
cause
of
the
former
illness
of
her
sisterin
law
claiming
that
Christian
Science
and
her
own
concentration
had
cured
her
She
was
a
masculine
type
a
very
large
woman
preferring
to
assist
her
husband
with
his
oil
station
rather
than
care
for
her
home
After
a
long
illness
she
died
in
the
arms
of
Mrs
Anna
R
who
then
remained
in
the
house
to
care
for
the
widower
and
also
keep
house
for
him
She
occupied
the
room
and
bed
of
her
sister
in
law
and
not
only
attended
to
all
household
duties
but
spent
much
time
working
in
the
garden
until
her
strength
failed
when
she
became
negative
and
was
again
disturbed
by
spirit
interference
She
acted
in
a
masculine
manner
and
a
brother
Mr
Herman
M
realizing
that
some
spirit
had
taken
possession
of
his
sister
at
first
thought
the
entity
was
a
man
But
Mrs
Anna
R
began
to
talk
as
though
she
were
Mrs
Jessie
R
and
authoritatively
ordered
everyone
to
leave
the
house
Mr
M
urged
his
sister
to
come
to
us
for
treatment
but
this
she
refused
to
do
insisting
under
control
of
the
obsessing
entity
that
Christian
Science
cured
me
the
last
time
Mr
M
then
telephoned
us
regarding
the
situation
and
attended
a
seance
in
our
home
mentally
commanding
the
spirit
that
was
troubling
his
sister
to
come
with
him
We
concentrated
for
the
patient
and
when
Mrs
Wickland
became
entranced
a
corroborative
conversation
with
the
controlling
spirit
ensued
Spirit
MRS
JESSIE
R
Patient
MRS
ANNA
R
PSYCHIC
MRS
WICKLAND
Doctor

Touching

Intelligent

Sp
I

t

There
must
be
something
the
matter
with
you
They
all
think
they
are
smart
Evidently
referring
to
intelligent
spirits
who
had
been
endeavoring
to
free
patient
from
influence
of
this
entity
I
tell
them
they
can
t
fool
me
I
don
t
want
to
talk
to
any
of
you
Dr
To
whom
are

Flourishing

you
This

Dr
Can

I
don
t

The

Sp
Oh

Dramatically
Now

and
I

going
to
stay
right
here
Dr
Just
now
you
are
in
our
home
Do
you
know

Sp
Yes
I
knew
you
some
years
ago
When
visiting
the
patient
Mrs
Anna
R
who
had
been
restored
to
health
while
under
our
care
But
I
never
believed
in
you
I
was
a
good
Christian
Scientist
Now
all
of
you
get
right
out
of
here
This
is
my
home
What
right
have
any
of
you
here
Mr
G
You
speak
as
if
you
were
omnipotent
Sp
I
am
not
God
but
I
am
next
to
Him
When
you
are
a
true
Christian
Scientist
you
come
next
to
God
Dr
What
about
the
lady
whom
you
have
been
bothering
Sp
She
can
go
to

dickens
When
I
get
well
I
ll
show
her
That

Dr
Did
you

I
worked

helped

them
out
Dr
Who

occupying
it
Sp
My
husband
is
there
for
one
Dr
Do
you
want
him
to
leave
Sp
I
want
everybody
to
get
out
Dr
Did
you
pass
out
Sp
Oh
no
you
ll
find
out
that
I
m
not
dead

I
scared
one
woman
Dr
Who
was
that
Sp
She
laid
down
on
my
bed
but
I
made
her
get
up
I
scared
her
Mrs
N
W
Remembering
that
upon
a
recent
visit
to
the
patient
s
home
she
had
lain
down
to
rest
upon
the
bed
which
had
belonged
to
the
former
mistress
of
the
house
but
had
been
unable
to
remain
there
because
of
an
unpleasant
influence
I
wasn
t
at
all
frightened
Sp
Just
the
same
I
made
you
get
up
Dr
What
satisfaction
do
you
find
in
staying
around
the
house
Don
t
you
realize
you
are
a
spirit
Sp
I
don
t
believe
in
spirits
and
never
did
Several
years
ago
you
talked
spirits
to
me
but
I

Do

you

I
am
Jessie

Sister

Mrs

You
thought
you
would
chase
me
out

you
got
left
Mr

I
think
we
succeeded

getting
you
away
You
are

Dr
Wickland

home
now
Sp
All
of
you
tried
to
chase
me
out
but
you
got
left
Dr
No
they
didn
t
because
you
are
now
at
our
home
Sp
I
never
liked
you
You
believe
in
spirits
and
I
don
t
Dr
You
believe
in
the
continuation
of
life
don
t
you
What
are
spirits
but
those
who
have
passed
on
to
a
continued
existence
Sp
Angrily
I
tell
you
I
have
not
passed
on
I
live
in
my
home

I
want
everybody
chased
out
Dr
Christian
Scientists
die
just
as
other
persons
do
Sp
Not
if
they
are
in
the
understanding
Dr
Mrs
Eddy
died
Where
does
a
Christian
Scientist
expect
to
go
when
he
loses
the
physical
body
Sp
Body
The
body
is
only
imagination
Dr
Then
why
do
you
object
when
I
touch
your
arm
Sp
Because
I
feel
tied
up
I
was
a
big
fat
woman
and
here
I
am
with
a
little
body
I
have
told
you
before
I
don
t
like
you
and
I
never
did
Dr
Why
Sp
Because
you
always
talked
about
spirits
Dr
Yes
we
often
talked
about
the
subject
You
are
now
proving
the
fact
of
spirit
return
Sp
Addressing
patient
s
brother
Mr
Herman
M
Herm
why
did
you
bring
me
here
Mr
M
I
thought
you
needed
a
little
education
You
were
not
doing
the
right
thing
where
you
were
Dr
Did
you
come
here
in
an
auto
Sp
I
don
t
know
how
I
came
Herm
made
me
come
with
him
Dr
Did
you
bring
anyone
else
with
you
Referring
to
spirits
obsessing
the
patient
Sp
Three
of
us
came
They
help
me
They
are
all
good
Christian
Scientists
They
don
t
associate
with
anybody
but
their
own
people
because
it
causes
cross
currents
I
was
the
leader
Laughing
They
all
thought
I
was
a
man
I
did
a
man
s
work
so
why
shouldn
t
I
have
the
honor
of
being
a
man
My
husband
was
sick
but
he
is
well
now
Just
as
soon
as
Anna
came
he
braced
up
Dr
Because
your
sister
in
law
took
proper
care
of
him
Sp
What
business
had
they
to
bring
me
here
I
said
I
would
never
go
to
Wicklands
again
Patient
had
made
similar
statements
the
day
before
although
normally
very
friendly
Mr
M
I
heard
last
Sunday
that
the
Christian
Scientists
take
the
credit
for
curing
Anna
some
years
ago
when
the
Wicklands
straightened
her
out
and
got
rascal
spirits
away
from
her
Sp
To
Mr
M
I
will
get
you
yet
Mr
M
Don
t
worry
about
me
You
had
better
try
to
get
understanding
Dr
This
body
belongs
to
Mrs
Wickland
Sp
I
used
to
talk
to
you
folks
when
I
came
to
your
house
to
see
Anna
but
I
had
no
use
for
you
If
you
had
become
Christian
Scientists
I
would
have
been
interested
in
you
Dr
You
are
controlling
the
body
of
Mrs
Wickland
and
she
is
unconscious
while
you
talk
through
her
You
claim
you
are
Jessie
R
but
when
I
look
at
you
I
see
the
face
of
my
wife
hence
you
are
a
spirit
Sp
How
could
I
get
in
this
little
body
when
I
am
a
big
fat
woman
Dr
You
are
a
spirit
and
spirit
does
not
need
a
big
body
You
must
realize
you
are
a
spirit
and
understand
your
situation
When
spirits
are
ignorant
of
their
condition
they
often
cause
much
trouble
The
spirit
of
Mrs
Eddy
has
spoken
through
this
same
instrument
several
times
and
she
has
always
expressed
regret
that
she
failed
to
include
in
her
teachings
the
truth
of
spirit
communication
which
she
knew
from
her
own
experience
to
be
a
fact
Sp
Where
is
Wes
Wesley
R
her
husband
Dr
On
the
ranch
because
that
is
his
home
Sp
He
likes
it
there
much
better
now
than
he
used
to
Why
is
Mel
R
bothering
me
Referring
to
spirit
husband
of
patient
He
is
here
now
He
says
I
have
no
business
to
bother
his
wife
Dr
Ask
him
whether
you
are
so
called
dead
Sp
He
says
Yes
and
that
everything
you
have
said
is
true
He
bothers
me
all
the
time
Dr
He
is
not
in
the
physical
we
cannot
see
him
You
know
that
he
has
passed
out
You
say
he
bothers
you
Sp
Yes
He
is
here
and
he
says
I
shall
not
stay
around
the
house
but
must
keep
away
and
leave
my
husband
and
Anna
alone
Dr
Does
any
one
ever
talk
to
you
Sp
No
they
take
no
notice
of
me
and
that
s
what
makes
me
so
mad
Listening
to
some
invisible
You
tell
Anna
that
I
feel
sorry
for
what
I
have
done
to
her
Her
husband
spirit
has
opened
my
eyes
I
am
also
sorry
for

You
must
acquire
understanding

Pray
for
me
Tell
Anna
how
sorry
I
am
that
I
have
disturbed
her
I
did
not
have
a
proper
understanding

I
was
angry
I
had
a
quick
temper

you
know
that
Dr
It
was
wrong
to
upset
Mrs
R
She
thought
a
great
deal
of
you
Sp
Penitently
I
can
see
how
selfish
I
have
been
My
Christian
Science
belief
was
only
a
cloak
Dr
The
higher
ideals
of
Christian
Science
are
excellent
but
should
include
the
whole

Help
Anna

there
any

Yes

Mel
trying
to
get
them
away
Sp
He
chased
me
all
the
time

I
didn

wanted
you

realize
your
condition

leave
his
wife
alone

Will
you
help
her
Doctor
Dr
That
is
what
we
are
trying
to
do

I
liked
my
home
very
much
I
was
taken
very
sick

I
went
to
sleep
died
and
after
awhile
when
I
woke
up
things
were
changed
Anna
was
taking
care
of
my
home
and
I
stood
it
for
awhile
then
I
wanted
my
place
as
I
had
always
had
it
I
commenced
to
bother
Anna
Poor
girl
I
wouldn
t
let
her
come
here
Please
help
her
and
help
me
too
Dr
Yes
we
will
but
you
must
also
help
yourself

They
spirits
tell
me
I
have
to
go
but
where
I
don
t
know
Dr
Mrs
R
s
husband
and
other
spirits
will
take
care
of
you
and
teach
you
how
to
progress
in
your
new
life
Forget
the
past
You
must
broaden
your
mind
Realize
there
is
a
spirit
world
We
are
all
spirits
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
it
My
wife
allows
spirits
to
control
her
body
in
order
that
we
may
enlighten
them
and
learn
the
facts
If
the
future
life
were
more
clearly
understood
such
conditions
as
yours
would
not
exist
If
you
had
understood
the
truth
of
spirit
existence
spirits
could
have
helped
you
at
the
time
you
passed
on
But
your
mind
was
on
the
earth
plane
Now
you
have
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
advance

can

thank
you

Goodbye
The
following
day
a
sister
of
Mrs
R
telephoned
that
a
noticeable
change
had
taken
place
in
the
patient

that
the
latter
had
that
morning
said
I
want
to
go
to
Dr
Wickland

treatment
Upon

arrival

EXPERIENCE

MARY
BAKER
EDDY
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
wanted
to
come
again
to
speak
of
the
work
you
are
doing
What
a
blessing
it
is
to
humanity
to
help
the
mortals
here
on
earth
and
the
spirit
who
has
passed
on
in
ignorance
with
no
knowledge
of
the
life
beyond
I
closed
the
door
I
should
have
opened
wide
to
give
my
knowledge
to
the
world
I
had
the
power
and
gift
that
God
gave
me
to
do
work
to
help
humanity
and
to
teach
humanity
that
there
is
a
life
after
this
I
was
a
medium
and
could
have
helped
open
the
door
from
the
spirit
world
to
earth
life
but
I
closed
it
because
of
my
selfishness
Also
I
liked
to
have
something
new
that
was
not
known
before
and
to
establish
a
religion
of
my
own
I
taught
the
wrong
religion
of
life
and
I
denied
the
truth
of
spirit
return
and
tried
to
give
out
other
things
which
suited
my
own
fancy
my
own
self
again
I
shut
the
door
for
myself
and
for
my
followers
hereafter
If
you
could
only
help
me
to
open
the
door
again
to
tell
them
that
I
am
trying
my
very
best
to
open
the
eyes
of
my
followers
Tell
them
not
to
shut
the
door
to
the
truth
Truth
will
stand
wherever
you
find
it
but
do
not
deny
it
when
you
find
it
I
denied
it
and
so
I
suffer
Here
are
my
followers
coming
to
me
one
by
one
Every
day
there
are
some
coming
over
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
I
am
trying
to
tell
them
of
the
beautiful
spirit
world
But
they
say
No
you
are
not
Mrs
Eddy
because
she
did
not
teach
that
when
she
was
on
earth
You
are
only
a
false
person
And
then
they
go
away
You
see
what
I
have
to
deal
with
and
I
cannot
progress
until
I
can
help
all
these
to
open
their
eyes
We
should
not
deny
God
s
wonderful
manifestation
of
matter
It
is
real
not
imagination
You
could
not
live
without
matter
You
could
not
have
manifestations
without
matter
I
denied
the
wonderful
manifestation
of
matter
and
called
it
only
imagination
and
error
We
have
only
one
mind
the
mind
that
God
gave
to
every
mortal
being
Matter
belongs
to
material
things
Still
we
have
matter
in
the
spirit
world
but
more
ethereal
I
denied
it
What
is
my
spiritual
body
now
It
is
in
a
very
crippled
condition
because
my
mind
was
so
closed
and
I
denied
the
truth
I
prayed
to
God
and
I
said
that
God
was
All
in
All
and
His
manifestations
beautiful
and
said
that
we
should
look
up
to
Him
Where
is
God
What
is
God
I
said
to
my
people
that
God
is
Love
and
Love
is
God
but
that
phrase
became
only
empty
talk
with
my
followers
We
must
realize
God
and
where
God
is
God
is
Life
God
is
Electricity
because
electricity
is
life
Electricity
is
only
one
part
of
God
s
wonderful
manifestation
Flowers
and
colors
of
all
kinds
are
manifestations
of
His
wonders
Go
into
chemistry
go
into
the
wonderful
mystery
of
life
go
into
the
microscopical
world
These
I
denied
entirely
I
denied
there
was
such
a
thing
as
disease
and
denied
the
existence
of
germs
When
you
get
into
the
microscopical
world
you
will
find
a
world
in
itself
and
a
very
wonderful
one
Now
I
am
talking
of
what
I
have
learned
Body
and
spirit
are
the
nearest
to
His
wonderful
manifestation
yet
a
little
microbe
can
kill
the
body
but
not
the
spirit
Why
should
we
not
be
powerful
enough
to
overcome
a
little
microbe
I
denied
God
by
denying
matter
Let
us
go
into
chemistry
and
see
the
wonderful
things
there
That
is
matter
Did
I
go
into
it
No
I
did
not
It
is
easy
to
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
matter
that
it
is
only
mortal
error
Let
us
study
Anything
that
is
in
matter
study
in
every
phase
I
have
my
eyes
open
now
I
wish
I
could
come
back
to
teach
my
people
the
wonders
of
Nature
and
the
wonders
we
can
do
to
help
humanity
and
the
spirits
that
are
in
darkness
I
am
here
myself
I
have
to
serve
for
what
I
have
done
and
I
speak
not
here
alone
but
everywhere
I
came
to
tell
you
this
Let
everyone
open
the
door
to
the
spirit
world
when
he
has
once
found
it
Do
not
deny
it
do
not
deny
it
Christ
said
do
not
hide
your
light
under
a
bushel
Let
it
shine
for
others
Christ
said
I
am
the
light
of
the
world
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
darkness
Christ
was
the
Truth
When
you
find
the
truth
do
not
deny
it
but
give
it
out
to
the
world
I
shut
the
door
I
wanted
to
keep
the
people
under
my
control
and
I
did
I
am
now
suffering
for
what
I
did
Tonight
I
feel
so
happy
to
think
I
can
be
of
help
to
earthbound
spirits
that
are
doing
very
much
mischief
to
humanity
If
you
could
only
see
how
many
spirits
there
are
in
darkness
who
cling
to
human
bodies
and
obsess
people
and
send
them
to
the
asylums
or
to
the
spirit
world
by
shortening
their
lives
There
is
so
much
work
to
be
done
Let
us
all
join
hands
and
work
together
to
spread
the
truth
of
the
life
hereafter
and
also
to
help
the
earthbound
spirits
Do
not
cast
them
away
and
say
they
are
devils
They
are
only
ignorant
spirits
like
myself
I
wanted
to
be
something
in
the
world
and
sold
my
soul
for
money
Let
us
all
join
together
and
pray
to
God
to
open
the
hearts
of
all
my
people
to
look
into
the
higher
life
of
spirits
If
all
my
churches
could
be
turned
into
sanitariums
for
earthbound
spirits
what
great
good
could
be
done
We
could
empty
the
asylums
and
help
people
out
of
their
misery
Let
us
help
the
unfortunate
ones
instead
of
sending
them
to
the
asylums
where
they
are
mistreated
for
it
is
not
understood
that
the
poor
ones
who
are
obsessed
have
to
suffer
because
of
the
spirits
who
control
them
Let
us
try
to
do
all
we
can
to
spread
the
truth
and
help
every
one
who
is
obsessed
God
bless
you
all

MRS
WICKLAND
I
wish
all
could
realize
and
understand
how
beautiful
and
simple
conditions
are
if
people
would
only
open
their
eyes
to
see
them
I
mean
they
should
open
the
soul
eyes
but
they
are
so
material
And
everything
that
is
being
taught
is
only
matter
People
cannot
grasp
spiritual
things
The
Bible
is
a
beautiful
book
if
it
is
read
spiritually
not
taken
literally
and
not
as
history
I
wanted
to
study
and
learn
what
is
in
life
what
is
the
aim
of
life
here
on
earth
If
you
would
only
stop
to
think
and
study
yourself
a
little
you
would
see
how
wonderfully
God
has
manifested
in
you
First
there
is
your
material
body
how
beautifully
and
wonderfully
it
is
constructed
But
how
much
more
wonderful
your
mind
is
How
few
understand
the
real
meaning
of
life
it
is
always
theory
or
dogma
It
seems
hard
to
get
people
to
understand
When
they
get
a
little
glimpse
of
light
they
add
dogma
and
theories
of
various
kinds
If
they
would
only
be
natural
and
look
at
Nature
Everywhere
you
look
it
is
so
simple
to
understand
There
is
no
dogma
or
theory
in
Nature
s
finer
forces
These
forces
are
hidden
but
they
are
for
you
to
discover
It
is
for
you
to
find
God
s
wonderful
manifestation
in
Nature
Let
us
worship
God
in
that
way
Let
us
worship
Him
in
that
wonderful
spirit
which
is
everywhere
Let
us
send
out
love
to
His
children
We
are
all
children
of
God
not
just
my
child
or
your
child
but
all
Do
not
think
there
is
no
one
for
you
but
your
own
child
That
attitude
is
a
sin
and
very
selfish
for
it
is
all
only
for
self
Let
us
give
out
love
as
God
gives
it
to
us
all
Let
the
sun
shine
every
day
on
us
and
on
everybody
not
one
or
two
but
all
Let
the
sun
of
understanding
bring
out
beautiful
thoughts
of
love
I
want
to
know
the
real
life
I
have
had
many
difficulties
and
I
still
have
because
I
wanted
to
shine
and
I
wanted
to
be
a
light
I
wanted
to
be
known
as
one
of
The
Teachers
I
had
my
difficulties
before
I
attained
my
ambition
I
followed
studies
of
various
kinds
but
most
of
all
the
secret
of
suggestion
If
you
knew
how
to
apply
and
concentrate
Get
one
thing
in
mind
and
do
not
let
anything
else
come
into
your
mind
just
concentrate
your
thoughts
on
that
very
thing
Suggest
and
suggest
and
concentrate
then
you
will
gain
strength
and
power
When
you
talk
try
to
suggest
things
keep
them
in
your
mind
and
hold
them
because
you
have
power
over
them
There
are
meetings
of
various
kinds
but
in
a
meeting
for
concentration
and
suggestion
there
is
power
and
strength
A
man
can
hold
his
audience
by
his
hypnotic
power
and
you
follow
along
and
presently
you
get
strength
and
power
I
studied
that
because
I
wanted
to
have
such
power
and
I
got
it
I
got
that
but
another
much
more
important
thing
I
did
not
get
which
was
to
study
Nature
s
finer
forces
instead
of
clothing
myself
with
one
idea
and
just
circling
around
and
around
I
held
people
in
that
circle
and
did
not
let
them
get
out
If
I
had
only
done
what
was
first
given
to
me
in
a
vision
That
is
what
I
should
have
done
but
I
closed
the
door
because
I
wanted
to
hold
my
people
through
suggestion
I
felt
that
I
had
the
power
to
conquer
everything
even
the
world
I
did
a
great
deal
but
selfishness
crept
in
I
meant
well
in
the
beginning
and
I
did
well
but
I
was
selfish
I
thought
I
had
it
all
Others
had
power
before
me
and
others
will
have
it
after
me
in
the
same
way
but
I
felt
I
had
it
all
and
that
I
had
found
it
all
I
was
not
true
I
should
have
said
I
had
found
the
truth
and
I
should
have
given
it
to
others
as
it
was
given
to
me
but
I
did
not
I
called
it
my
own
and
I
closed
the
door
for
the
real
truth
I
found
the
truth
in
the
beginning
but
I
clung
to
theory
and
that
is
the
way
with
all
of
us
who
try
to
be
leading
lights
We
are
always
clinging
to
theories
and
not
to
the
truth
Theories
seem
to
hold
the
people
better
than
does
the
truth
We
do
not
teach
it
as
we
should
The
truth
would
always
stand
if
we
did
not
deny
it
All
leaders
want
a
little
theory
of
their
own
and
want
to
gather
the
people
around
them
and
hold
them
They
succeed
for
a
while
only
for
truth
will
spring
up
and
spread
Do
not
be
afraid
of
the
truth
do
not
be
ashamed
of
it
Some
day
or
other
every
one
will
have
an
understanding
of
truth
It
is
there
and
it
will
blossom
Do
not
clothe
it
with
dogma
and
theory
If
I
had
taught
the
truth
I
should
be
so
much
happier
and
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
for
my
Church
I
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
in
publishing
my
little
article
It
will
shed
a
little
light
here
and
there
People
may
say
No
and
scoff
but
they
cannot
do
so
truthfully
because
my
spirit
will
be
there
and
impress
the
truth
upon
them
I
never
felt
that
I
was
a
little
woman
I
felt
that
I
had
the
power
to
conquer
the
world
You
can
have
that
power
too
if
fear
does
not
interfere
with
you
Concentrate
and
shut
the
door
to
fear
Do
not
let
fear
come
in
If
you
feel
fear
say
No
no
no
I
am
not
afraid
I
shall
conquer
and
you
will
be
surprised
at
your
power
In
a
moment
you
will
feel
you
are
a
giant
Shut
the
door
to
fear
and
open
the
door
to
spiritual
power
and
the
strength
of
God
will
flow
in
and
give
you
strength
and
power
to
conquer
You
can
never
accomplish
anything
when
you
have
fear
Take
five
minutes
each
day
and
concentrate
on
fear
Say
Published
in
the
magazine
Reason
I
shall
never
be
afraid
I
can
conquer
and
keep
on
and
on
and
you
will
be
surprised
at
the
result
There
is
always
worry
and
fear
Worry
is
the
sister
to
fear
When
you
have
conquered
these
two
you
will
have
strength
and
power
and
you
can
help
in
healing
You
can
help
everybody
by
just
speaking
a
word
to
them
When
I
had
conquered
fear
and
worry
I
sent
my
thoughts
for
strength
and
health
to
the
persons
who
were
sick
That
was
power
and
removed
the
fear
of
sickness
from
them
When
you
treat
persons
the
first
thing
is
to
take
away
fear
and
worry
Let
them
forget
themselves
Forget
self
and
you
will
be
surprised
how
strong
and
well
you
will
be
That
is
the
secret
of
health
It
takes
time
to
conquer
do
not
be
discouraged
If
it
looks
dark
overcome
fear
and
worry
When
you
once
have
conquered
you
will
be
well
You
will
be
well
and
you
will
do
well
in
every
way
Now
I
will
say
just
a
few
words
about
my
experience
in
the
spirit
world
In
the
first
place
when
I
passed
into
the
spirit
side
of
life
it
was
in
one
way
surprising
to
me
because
I
had
concentrated
that
I
should
live
forever
and
had
gotten
the
idea
in
my
mind
that
I
would
not
die
I
had
the
idea
that
there
is
no
death
and
that
I
would
never
die
I
took
it
literally
I
thought
my
body
would
never
die
and
that
I
would
stay
on
earth
forever
There
is
no
death
when
you
have
understanding
we
only
change
the
physical
body
for
the
spiritual
My
body
began
to
grow
old
I
concentrated
and
suggested
but
I
used
too
much
energy
in
my
work
and
I
wore
out
Finally
I
lost
out
and
another
stepped
in
at
the
last
I
was
obsessed
Of
course
my
people
did
not
know
it
but
there
were
times
when
I
was
not
myself
I
thought
I
would
never
die
but
I
had
to
go
just
the
same
Now
I
can
see
how
ridiculous
the
thing
was
You
know
I
did
not
believe
in
matter
There
was
no
such
thing
as
matter
still
my
body
was
placed
in
a
casket
and
sealed
so
well
that
my
body
could
never
get
out
of
the
casket
It
was
sealed
in
many
ways
so
nobody
could
get
it
If
there
is
no
matter
why
should
all
that
money
have
been
used
to
put
my
body
into
the
grave
That
was
against
my
teachings
but
we
are
material
nevertheless
When
I
woke
up
to
life
remember
I
say
life
because
that
was
the
real
life
I
had
a
spirit
body
In
my
visions
I
had
been
to
the
spirit
world
many
times
and
had
always
returned
to
earth
This
time
I
felt
that
I
could
go
back
again
but
my
body
was
not
there
It
had
been
interred
Still
I
did
not
realize
the
change
because
I
had
closed
the
door
for
spirit
return
I
did
not
want
to
teach
it
I
knew
it
because
I
was
a
medium
in
my
early
days
I
gave
readings
in
Boston
for
some
time
and
I
gave
lectures
as
well
but
after
a
while
I
denied
it
all
the
truth
was
not
in
me
When
I
woke
up
in
my
spirit
body
I
still
did
not
realize
that
it
was
not
my
material
body
It
was
very
hard
for
me
to
understand
that
I
had
gone
through
the
change
called
death
because
I
had
concentrated
and
concentrated
that
I
should
never
die
The
realization
took
much
time
Then
I
had
much
to
do
and
many
difficulties
to
overcome
First
of
all
came
my
brother
Albert
When
he
came
I
felt
that
I
did
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
spirits
You
see
I
said
in
my
book
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
spirit
return
I
had
so
hypnotized
myself
with
that
theory
that
it
was
real
to
me
Albert
came
and
told
me
that
I
had
not
taught
the
whole
truth
There
was
a
time
when
I
was
a
medium
and
he
talked
through
me
but
after
a
while
I
refused
to
allow
this
Now
he
came
to
me
again
and
said
Come
I
will
show
you
that
what
you
have
taught
is
not
true
and
that
you
did
not
tell
the
truth
After
that
my
first
husband
came
He
understood
me
better
than
the
rest
He
showed
me
the
way
One
by
one
many
friends
came
Then
came
Quimby
he
said
You
took
my
theory
Why
did
you
not
give
me
a
little
credit
for
the
help
I
gave
you
Then
I
saw
how
selfish
I
had
been
I
was
accused
I
was
helped
but
had
not
given
credit
for
it
I
was
obsessed
when
I
was
a
young
child
and
often
had
spells
of
obsession
For
many
years
those
obsession
spells
came
over
me
Quimby
helped
me
he
took
the
spirits
away
and
taught
me
the
true
religion
He
taught
me
to
know
myself
He
taught
me
spirit
return
but
I
did
not
listen
After
he
had
gone
I
took
his
theory
as
my
own
In
the
spirit
world
I
had
to
go
through
a
great
deal
to
over
come
selfishness
I
had
to
serve
and
learn
the
lesson
of
life
as
a
little
child
I
had
to
be
taught
about
God
in
a
different
way
Mental
healing
is
something
we
should
all
learn
It
is
of
great
importance
Let
us
all
learn
to
overcome
by
suggestion
and
concentration
Get
your
mind
centered
and
learn
the
art
of
concentration
Take
some
object
say
that
table
concentrate
and
concentrate
and
try
to
hold
your
mind
on
that
table
nothing
else
for
five
minutes
You
cannot
do
it
Try
try
very
hard
and
after
a
while
you
will
succeed
That
is
the
secret
of
health
concentration
is
the
secret
of
power
You
must
be
able
to
concentrate
your
mind
on
one
object
for
five
minutes
This
will
require
a
long
long
time
of
practice
It
does
not
come
to
you
at
once
because
as
soon
as
you
try
to
concentrate
and
keep
your
mind
absolutely
on
the
table
there
will
be
a
dozen
other
thoughts
coming
into
your
mind
Keep
them
out
and
keep
your
mind
on
the
object
and
you
will
find
in
time
that
I
am
right
When
you
can
concentrate
your
mind
for
even
one
or
two
minutes
you
have
gained
much
Say
to
yourself
I
can
concentrate
for
I
have
no
fear
or
worry
and
keep
on
concentrating
Shut
other
things
out
and
keep
on
shutting
them
out
and
before
you
know
it
you
will
have
strength
and
you
will
feel
powerful
because
you
have
a
part
of
life
itself
God
When
you
have
gained
that
power
you
can
say
to
a
sick
person
I
send
you
power
and
you
will
have
strength
and
health
and
you
will
be
surprised
how
quickly
recovery
follows
Before
you
try
to
send
out
that
power
concentrate
your
mind
on
one
object
for
fifteen
minutes
Do
not
think
Now
I
have
the
power
in
my
hands
and
I
can
heal
for
you
cannot
heal
if
your
mind
is
not
there
For
that
reason
many
healers
are
not
successful
The
mind
must
be
centered
on
one
object
before
you
can
heal
That
is
the
secret
of
healing
Now
learn
the
lesson
and
conquer
When
you
are
sick
or
you
go
into
a
sick
room
concentrate
your
mind
on
some
object
Hold
your
mind
on
that
object
for
a
while
and
you
will
feel
that
you
have
great
power
and
that
you
can
heal
because
you
will
receive
strength
from
God
to
heal
That
is
another
secret
We
should
all
understand
it
By
concentration
without
fear
and
worry
you
can
all
heal
but
remember
settle
your
mind
first
before
you
begin
to
heal
for
otherwise
it
will
be
of
no
use
Now
I
have
taken
up
too
much
of
your
time
but
I
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
and
to
thank
you
for
having
my
article
published
It
will
awaken
some
people
and
teach
them
to
think
and
understand
that
the
real
life
is
on
the
other
side
Do
not
try
to
lean
on
others
but
stand
by
your
own
self
and
conquer
self
then
you
can
help
others
and
bring
them
together
in
one
circle
of
harmony
and
you
will
have
true
happiness
This
is

Thank
you
for
letting
me
come
Good
Night
CHAPTER
XV
Theosophy
THAT
the
belief
in
reincarnation
on
earth
is
a
fallacious
one
and
prevents
progression
to
higher
spiritual
realms
after
transition
has
been
frequently
declared
by
advanced
spirits
while
numerous
cases
of
obsession
which
have
come
under
our
care
have
been
due
to
spirits
who
in
endeavoring
to
reincarnate
in
children
have
found
themselves
imprisoned
in
the
magnetic
aura
causing
great
suffering
to
both
their
victims
and
themselves
A
little
boy
in
Chicago
Jack
T
had
been
normal
until
the
age
of
five
when
he
began
to
manifest
precocious
tendencies
and
acted
strangely
Formerly
he
had
had
the
natural
disposition
of
a
child
but
began
to
fret
about
things
ordinarily
foreign
to
a
child
s
mind
and
acted
in
many
ways
like
an
adult
He
worried
over
trifles
lay
awake
at
night
with
strange
mutterings
and
presentiments
and
at
times
had
an
uncontrollable
temper
He
was
a
boy
of
good
appearance
but
talked
constantly
of
being
old
homely
and
ugly
looking
and
was
so
intractable
that
efforts
at
reprimand
and
correction
proved
of
no
avail
This
condition
became
so
aggravated
that
his
family
despaired
of
restoring
the
boy
s
reason
A
relative
who
knew
of
our
experimental
work
in
abnormal
psychology
wrote
to
the
Institute
requesting
us
to
concentrate
for
the
boy
This
was
done
and
an
entity
whose
actions
and
expressions
were
in
every
way
like
those
of
the
boy
was
attracted
to
the
psychic
Mrs
Wickland
This
entity
said
his
name
was
Charlie
Herrman
he
was
aware
of
having
died
and
declared
he
was
a
very
homely
man
with
ugly
features
and
a
face
covered
with
pock
marks
Nobody
had
cared
for
him
and
this
fact
preyed
on
his
mind
Someone
had
once
told
him
that
after
death
individuals
could
reincarnate
and
become
whatever
they
wished
to
be
Since
his
only
desire
was
to
be
good
looking
so
that
others
would
not
shun
him
he
decided
to
try
and
reincarnate
As
a
result
he
became
entangled
in
the
magnetic
aura
of
a
small
boy
and
was
unable
to
free
himself
See
Chap
Page
Spirit
John
Edwards
Finding
that
he
was
helplessly
imprisoned
and
incapable
of
making
himself
understood
he
had
outbursts
of
temper
and
felt
like
flying
to
pieces
They
called
me
Jack
at
times
but
I
am
not
Jack
That
was
not
my
name
and
I
could
not
understand
Our
concentration
for
the
boy
had
freed
the
spirit
and
for
this
he
was
very
grateful
After
instructions
were
given
regarding
spiritual
progression
and
he
had
been
assured
that
he
need
no
longer
be
homely
if
he
would
discard
old
ideas
from
his
mind
forget
self
and
strive
to
help
others
he
expressed
great
eagerness
to
go
with
the
spirits
who
he
stated
had
come
to
help
him
In
a
letter
written
a
few
days
later
by
the
boy
s
mother
we
were
informed
that
a
remarkable
change
had
occurred
in
the
child
Jack
is
now
a
boy
again
and
has
been
very
good
this
week
really
like
he
used
to
be
He
remained
normal
and
received
excellent
grades
in
school
where
his
progress
from
that
time
on
was
unusually
rapid
At
one
time
we
concentrated
for
a
crippled
child
in
Hollywood
with
interesting
results

Is
it
really
true
that
I
am
well
now
Can
I
talk
Can
I
move
my
arms
and
feet
Then
reincarnation
is
true
because
before
I
could
neither
talk
nor
walk
How
did
I
get
out
of
the
child
Doctor
Intelligent
spirits
brought
you
here
for
help
Sp
I
wanted
to
come
back
and
reincarnate
in
a
child
and
I
got
in
and
could
not
get
out
I
was
so
paralyzed
that
I
could
not
express
myself
and
I
was
in
an
awful
state
I
was
a
Theosophist
and
I
wanted
to
reincarnate
to
be
great
I
got
into
a
child
s
body
and
crippled
it
and
also
crippled
my
mind
and
that
of
the
child
I
stayed
in
the
child
because
I
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
I
acted
as
a
child
and
I
could
not
talk
I
know
I
passed
out
of
my
mortal
body
some
years
ago
far
away
in
India
but
I
do
not
realize
when
it
took
place
I
wanted
so
much
to
reincarnate
and
to
come
back
to
this
earth
life
to
live
my
other
Karma
Do
not
hold
on
to
the
thought
of
coming
back
but
look
for
something
higher
for
the
state
I
was
in
was
the
worst
torture
anybody
could
have
I
lived
in
Calcutta
and
wanted
to
learn
to
be
a
Master
and
go
through
my
Karma
but
instead
I
am
as
you
see
me
to
be
I
reincarnated
in
a
child
and
became
crippled
and
I
also
got
into
the
vibration
of
the
mother
It
was
very
hard
and
I
want
to
warn
others
never
to
come
back
and
try
to
reincarnate
through
a
little
child
Leave
reincarnation
alone
because
it
is
only
a
mistake
but
the
philosophy
of
Theosophy
is
very
fine
Look
upward
don
t
think
of
the
astral
shells
for
they
are
of
no
use
I
was
very
selfish
and
wanted
to
come
back
to
earth
life
just
to
be
something
great
but
instead
I
got
into
a
very
low
state
I
had
intended
to
show
the
Theosophists
that
I
could
come
back
and
reincarnate
in
a
child
Madam
Blavatsky
should
have
taught
differently
Pointing
to
an
invisible
I
will
tell
you
Madam
you
are
the
one
who
is
to
blame
for
the
condition
I
am
in
today
Madam
Blavatsky
stands
here
trying
to
help
me
now
She
is
the
one
who
gave
me
the
teachings
and
thoughts
of
reincarnation
and
now
she
is
trying
to
show
me
the
right
way
and
states
there
is
no
such
thing
as
reincarnation
One
gets
all
mixed
up
trying
to
enter
another
s
body
for
reincarnation
Dr
What
is
your
name
Sp
I
cannot
recall
my
name
just
now
Madam
Blavatsky
was
in
India
and
taught
Theosophy
had
many
followers
and
I
was
with
her
I
have
also
met
Anna
Kingsford
and
Dr
Hartmann
and
he
also
was
to
blame
for
my
condition
They
pushed
me
in
here
that
I
might
be
taught
and
freed
I
am
so
pleased
that
I
can
talk
again
that
is
something
I
have
not
been
able
to
do
for
years
Madam
Blavatsky
Anna
Kingsford
and
the
Judge
were
all
great
lights
and
now
they
have
found
out
their
big
mistakes
They
are
all
working
to
get
their
victims
free
and
so
they
brought
me
to
this
place
for
instruction
and
guidance
I
was
in
India
having
been
there
for
many
years
My
father
was
an
officer
in
the
Army
I
spent
most
of
my
time
in
Calcutta
where
I
met
all
the
great
lights
of
Theosophy
and
I
joined
the
Theosophical
Society
I
liked
Colonel
Olcott
he
was
a
great
fellow
I
remember
being
very
sick
in
India
for
some
time
I
have
no
desire
to
reincarnate
again
because
reincarnation
is
a
wrong
doctrine
It
creates
a
selfishness
to
come
back
One
can
learn
without
being
reincarnated
What
I
suppose
did
I
learn
in
my
last
reincarnation
in
the
child
What
did
I
learn
I
believed
in
Theosophy
and
my
Karma
and
I
thought
I
had
to
go
through
with
it
Colonel
Olcott
belonged
to
the
Great
Masters
He
belonged
to
the
spirit
of
Fire
and
Water
I
mean
the
elementals
of
Fire
and
Water
Dr
Have
you
ever
heard
of
mediums
Sp
They
are
only
astral
shells
Madam
Blavatsky
says
we
must
all
help
those
who
try
to
reincarnate
She
and
the
others
have
come
to
say
they
are
trying
to
help
and
for
that
purpose
have
formed
a
big
society
I
thought
I
had
come
to
life
when
I
came
here
and
that
I
could
reincarnate
and
talk
to
them
as
I
did
in
life
I
did
not
know
they
had
passed
over
Teaching
as
they
did
why
did
they
not
reincarnate
the
same
as
I
Madam
Blavatsky
was
a
great
missionary
as
you
know
She
says
she
is
now
trying
to
make
all
her
victims
understand
about
the
life
after
this
as
it
really
is
She
says
that
she
was
a
medium
at
one
time
but
that
she
did
not
want
anybody
to
control
her
She
thought
you
should
develop
your
own
self
and
mental
faculties
and
go
through
yourKarma
I
should
not
have
been
taught
the
falseness
I
was
Madam
tells
me
that
I
should
listen
to
this
gentleman
Dr
W
and
that
he
will
explain
things
Explanations
were
given
regarding
life
on
the
earth
plane
the
preparation
for
the
life
that
is
to
follow
and
the
fact
that
the
knowledge
and
wisdom
gained
here
will
be
the
light
of
understanding
each
one
carries
to
the
other
side
of
life
The
spirit
finally
gave
the
name
of
William
Stanley
and
departed
grateful
for
the
enlightenment
he
had
received
J
A
a
listless
crippled
boy
of
seven
years
with
an
adult
manner
of
speech
was
a
patient
from
Chicago
who
suffered
from
convulsions
and
a
slow
hesitant
stammering
was
notional
about
his
food
and
subject
to
violent
attacks
of
temper
Through
concentration
a
spirit
was
dislodged
from
him
a
superficial
Theosophist
who
was
peculiarly
self
hypnotized

shut

one

another

the
fourth

Dr
Were
you
a

in
the
first
place
Sp
I
do
not

anything
about
it
People
told
me
to
remember
about
my
lives
but
I
do
not
I
know
I
was
once
a
cripple
and
then
I
got
into
somebody
and
was
more
crippled
But
I
got
out
I
do
not
know
how
I
got
out
I
feel
stronger
now
than
I
have
before
I
thought
when
I
reincarnated
I
should
be
a
nice
young
man
but
instead
I
got
crippled
because
I
suppose
my
mind
was
crippled
Dr
What
did
they
call
you
when
you
were
a
cripple
Sp
I
had
so
many
names
but
you
know
I
liked
the
last
time
I
liked
it
very
much
to
be
a
rich
man
s
son
so
I
did
not
need
to
work
I
had
my
father
to
work
for
me
I
had
a
good
time
Dr
Did
you
become
a
rich
man
s
son
Sp
In
a
way
yes
and
in
another
way
no
Dr
What
is
your
name
Sp
My
name
was
once
upon
a
time
I
do
not
know
Some
time
ago
when
I
was
studying
Theosophy
I
was
a
cripple
born
Some
friends
brought
some
books
to
me
about
Madam
Blavatsky
They
called
me
Edward
Jackson
Dr
What
other
names
did
you
have
Sp
The
other
was
J
Dr
Was
J
a
grown
man
or
a
boy
Sp
I
do
not
like
that
fire
shooting
and
someone
talking
all
kinds
of
things
Why
cannot
I
reincarnate
and
not
be
a
cripple
all
the
time
Dr
I
suppose
when
you
found
yourself
in
a
rich
man
s
family
and
thought
of
reincarnation
you
believed
you
were
experiencing
your
former
condition
again
Sp
It
is
Karma
to
develop
one
s
highest
self
so
the
Theosophists
say
They
chased
me
out
so
I
tried
again
because
I
wanted
to
know
if
that
theory
is
true
or
not
Dr
It
is
very
true
in
one
way
earthbound
spirits
can
control
mortal
sensitives
That
is
very
true
Sp
They
must
live
out
their
Karma
which
has
been
put
out
for
them
it
is
the
only
way
Dr
Where
did
you
come
from
SP
Chicago
I
was
going
to
be
a
rich
man
s
son
but
I
was
turned
out
Dr
Did
you
like
that
Sp
I
was
fighting
and
when
I
get
mad
I
do
not
care
what
I
say
and
I
get
mad
once
in
a
while
Sometimes
I
get
so
mad
because
I
shall
be
a
cripple
all
my
life
When
I
reincarnated
I
got
into
the
same
crippled
state
again
Dr
Don
t
you
think
you
had
better
stop
trying
to
reincarnate
Sp
I
must
live
out
my
Karma
and
must
not
interfere
with
it
Dr
Then
you
must
continue
suffering
because
of
your
foolishness
Sp
I
was
trying
to
get
to
Devachan
I
was
not
well
educated
but
I
read
up
on
Devachan
which
is
the
resting
place
where
they
reincarnate
again
Dr
You
came
back
too
soon
Sp
Theosophy
appealed
to
my
mind
and
then
I
wanted
to
have
a
good
time
You
must
not
interfere
with
your
Karma
You
can
choose
your
life
and
I
was
going
to
have
plenty
of
money
but
I
got
crippled
again
But
my
mind
was
good
They
said
you
should
not
think
of
your
former
life
Dr
Who
told
you
that
Sp
They
said
you
should
progress
and
not
interfere
with
your
Karma
then
you
would
get
to
Devachan
I
suppose
I
must
be
an
astral
shell
I
did
not
study
enough
Dr
Would
you
like
to
use
a
little
discrimination
and
progress
in
the
right
way
to
the
spirit
life
Sp
I
want
to
go
to
Devachan
that
is
the
best
place
for
me
Then
you
can
be
a
Master
Dr
You
should
become
a
Master
of
your
own
destiny
Sp
I
want
to
be
a
Great
Master
Then
I
would
not
be
a
cripple
and
would
have
lived
out
my
Karma
Dr
How
were
you
crippled
Sp
In
my
legs
Dr
Could
you
not
walk
Sp
No
my
knees
were
too
weak
and
my
ankles
were
weak
I
am
crippled
all
over
now
Dr
Could
you
think
and
talk
SP
Yes
Dr
Do
you
like
corn
meal
mush
An
especial
aversion
of
the
patient
Sp
I
don
t
know
what
you
mean
Dr
Are
you
particular
about
eating
Sp
I
will
not
eat
meat
and
not
much
fish
I
like
to
have
some
raw
vegetables
I
want
my
food
more
sun
kissed
I
want
to
go
to
Devachan
and
be
a
Master
Dr
Master
of
what
Sp
Master
of
Higher
Things
I
want
to
be
a
Master
Dr
Madam
Blavatsky
denies
reincarnation
now
and
says
it
is
folly
Sp
She
doesn
t
know
what
she
is
talking
about
Dr
Do
you
want
to
be
perfectly
well
again
Sp
Then
I
have
to
reincarnate
again
Dr
Now
wake
up
and
be
sensible
Understand
you
are
a
spirit
You
are
now
controlling
the
body
of
my
wife
Sp
I
did
not
reincarnate
in
another
person
s
body
I
thought
next
time
I
would
reincarnate
differently
You
say
I
am
a
woman
now
I
do
not
want
to
be
a
girl
I
want
to
be
a
man
Dr
You
are
using
a
woman
s
body
just
now
Sp
I
have
to
be
born
again
even
if
I
am
crippled
Dr
Don
t
be
foolish
Realize
you
are
no
longer
crippled
Sp
How
can
you
tell
any
one
not
to
be
a
cripple
when
they
are
Dr
You
are
now
a
free
spirit
temporarily
controlling
a
woman
s
body
Sp
I
do
not
understand
what
you
are
talking
about
Dr
Your
Devachan
does
not
work
at
all
You
did
not
study
thoroughly
Sp
Yes
I
did
but
I
disregarded
it
Dr
Do
not
talk
such
nonsense
It
makes
nice
earthbound
spirits
Sp
We
have
to
reincarnate
to
learn
and
get
all
kinds
of
experiences
Dr
I
suppose
you
could
not
progress
to
Devachan
if
you
did
not
have
all
the
different
experiences
Sp
You
have
to
come
back
and
learn
them
Dr
Do
you
know
what
you
have
been
doing
You
have
been
controlling
different
persons
and
disturbing
their
lives
An
ignorant
spirit
ruins
the
life
of
a
mortal
sensitive
by
clinging
to
him
You
have
been
brought
here
for
help
and
are
now
controlling
my

s
body
Sp
I
have
to
reincarnate
in
your
wife
No
I
must
reincarnate
in
a
child
and
be
born
again
Dr
This
is
not
your
body
It
belongs
to
my
wife
and
you
are
using
it
temporarily
Sp
Then
I
have
to
reincarnate
in
your
wife
Dr
You
are
controlling
her
body
for
a
short
time
only
Look
at
this
hand
do
you
know
it
Sp
I
have
reincarnated
again
in
your
wife

body
No
you
must
reincarnate
again
in
a

be
born
again

You
do
not

When

When

Now

my

That

You

you

It

I
don

care
Dr
You
have
been

a

you
should
now
listen

the

You

Where

You

something

They

if
I
want

I

I
am
going
to
live
out
this

If
I
am
a

now
I
will
live
it
out
If
I
get

that
is
part
of

I
will
just
have
to
study
and
get
in
the
Inner
Circle
and
know
that
God
is
my
Creator
I
have
reincarnated
and
I
will
reincarnate
again
then
go
to
Devachan
and
be
happy
I
will
finish
my
Karma
Dr
You
get
out
and
take
your
Karma
with

You
think
you
are
going

take
away

the

My

and
I
studied
to

for

but
we
forgot
to
learn
the
simple
lesson
of
life

How
little

Here
I
am
again
This
is
Ralph
Mother
I
want
to
come
to
my
wife
but
cannot
as
the
door
is
shut
I
know
it
is
as
much
my
fault
as
it
is
my
wife
s
The
door
is
shut
for
me
and
will
be
for
some
time
because
of
the
dogma
and
creed
there
is
in
the
mind
If
only
my
wife
would
realize
the
truth
it
is
so
simple
but
the
simple
truth
is
always
rejected
Something
mysterious
is
always
accepted
We
thought
that
by
working
out
our
Karma
everything
would
be
all
right
but
we
developed
selfishness
It
is
selfish
to
shut
yourself
up
and
try
to
be
a
Master
Master
of
what
We
should
try
to
master
ourselves
try
to
learn
about
all
things
look
up
to
all
things
because
God
is
in
all
things
and
is
Love
and
Wisdom
We
should
not
feel
that
because
of
a
little
learning
we
are
better
than
others
merely
because
we
studied
to
be
Great
Masters
We
speak
of
things
of
which
we
do
not
realize
the
full
import
and
we
make
ourselves
sensitive
and
become
obsessed
I
realize
now
how
dangerous
the
doctrine
of
Reincarnation
is
According
to
that
doctrine
this
would
be
the
time
for
me
to
reincarnate
Should
I
reincarnate
and
obsess
a
child
and
tie
both
of
us
up
in
one
body
until
such
time
as
the
child
leaves
the
mortal
The
two
made
an
agreement
that
should
one
pass
out
the
other
would
not
try
to
establish
communication
considering
this
to
be
a
hinderance
to
the
ego
In
its
progression
to
Devachan
body
Why
should
I
reincarnate
and
make
a
child
become
an
idiot
All
creeds
should
be
set
aside
and
we
should
seek
the
simple
truth
of
life
Love
God
above
all
things
and
your
neighbor
as
yourself
There
would
be
great
rejoicing
if
everybody
tried
to
live
up
to
that
teaching
then
there
would
be
true
happiness
Creeds
and
dogmas
interfere
and
make
us
selfish
and
selfishness
is
the
root
of
all
evil
I
am
to
blame
for
the
present
conditions
surrounding
my
wife
Her
refusal
to
receive
spirit
communications
My
work
now
is
to
come
down
to
earth
to
help
the
ones
who
believe
in
the
same
theory
as
I
did
and
are
engaged
in
the
same
study
I
was
I
have
to
work
hard
trying
to
bring
them
to
realize
the
truth
I
must
also
work
to
try
to
bring
my
wife
to
the
realization
that
she
must
not
go
into
that
dogma
any
further
If
she
does
she
will
become
more
psychic
and
will
be
obsessed
by
some
theory
or
other
I
do
not
mean
obsessed
by
spirits
but
ideas
I
was
more
deeply
steeped
in
the
dogma
of
reincarnation
than
my
wife
because
I
was
further
advanced
in
my
studies
I
went
into
the
subject
deeper
than
she
We
were
both
so
selfish
in
our
theory
that
we
could
not
see
anything
else
and
we
condemned
all
other
theories
We
felt
we
were
better
than
many
others
because
we
lived
to
sacrifice
Having
adhered
to
a
restricted
diet
a
supposed
requirement
for
spiritual
attainment
The
body
is
only
a
dress
for
the
spirit
We
should
eat
what
comes
before
us
Let
us
not
put
our
minds
on
eating
and
drinking
We
should
not
sacrifice
our
bodies
and
crucify
the
flesh
to
become
more
spiritual
That
was
never
meant
to
be
Take
care
of
your
body
but
do
not
rob
it
of
its
needs
God
gave
it
to
you
to
take
care
of
Keep
it
in
a
healthy
condition
so
the
spirit
can
work
through
it
to
the
best
advantage
It
does
not
make
us
spiritual
to
abstain
from
certain
foods
We
need
specific
elements
for
the
body
so
let
us
strive
our
utmost
to
take
care
of
it
My
wife
is
hard
to
reach
We
had
agreed
not
to
try
to
call
each
other
back
after
death
We
were
hypnotized
by
our
theosophical
theory
that
we
must
go
on
and
clear
our
Karma
and
that
we
cannot
open
the
door
to
the
higher
life
unless
we
go
very
slowly
This
makes
it
much
harder
for
me
I
am
to
blame
as
much
as
she
is
I
shut
the
door
for
her
as
much
as
she
shut
the
door
for
me
I
condemned
Spiritualism
because
I
thought
the
theory
we
held
was
the
real
one
and
that
everything
else
was
false
Of
course
there
is
some
deception
in
Spiritualism
but
there
is
good
as
well
as
bad
in
every
movement
Let
us
not
be
carried
away
by
anything
let
us
use
reason
in
all
things

RALPH
S
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
It
will
soon
be
three
years
since
I
passed
away
but
in
those
three
years
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
I
did
not
find
conditions
as
I
had
believed
them
I
am
sorry
that
I
was
so
set
in
my
mind
on
the
theory
of
Theosophy
that
we
must
come
back
again
and
again
in
order
to
reach
the
higher
plane
Since
I
have
come
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
have
not
had
any
thought
of
coming
back
except
to
help
my
dear
wife
We
both
studied
to
learn
about
life
but
after
I
came
here
I
tried
to
impress
her
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
learn
about
the
religion
we
had
both
studied
because
it
is
not
the
true
religion
If
I
came
back
I
could
not
reincarnate
as
I
thought
I
would
rather
come
back
to
help
my
wife
and
learn
all
I
can
about
spirit
return
than
to
come
and
stay
in
one
state
for
a
certain
time
then
come
back
again
as
a
baby
I
had
said
to
my
wife
that
I
would
not
come
back
to
her
because
I
wanted
to
go
on
and
be
a
Master
We
think
a
Master
is
one
who
is
very
highly
developed
and
cannot
do
anything
but
be
holy
You
do
not
want
to
become
such
a
Master
the
greatest
masters
serve
The
more
we
learn
in
the
spirit
world
the
more
we
want
to
serve
Here
we
want
to
help
to
learn
to
teach
others
Christ
is
worshipped
as
a
Master
Did
He
come
back
He
went
among
the
poor
and
lowly
trying
to
teach
and
serve
people
and
to
help
them
to
a
higher
life
and
understanding
Learn
the
truth
give
it
to
others
and
serve
others
Be
a
master
in
learning
but
humble
in
serving
When
we
have
learned
to
serve
others
we
have
learned
the
lesson
Christ
taught
When
we
have
reached
that
state
we
can
love
our
enemies
as
ourselves
and
God
above
all
things
Then
we
are
masters
That
does
not
mean
that
we
are
so
high
that
we
cannot
come
back
to
serve
to
teach
to
help
others
It
means
that
we
must
all
be
masters
of
ourselves
and
conquer
all
desires

MRS
WICKLAND
Good
Evening
I
have
not
been
here
before
But
I
heard
of
you
while
I
was
on
earth
and
I
also
heard
of
your
work
and
had
read
your
pamphlet
We
should
all
try
to
understand
the
true
meaning
of
God
but
how
few
try
to
understand
the
actual
truth
Truth
is
always
crucified
Truth
should
be
known
and
not
clothed
with
all
sorts
of
creeds
When
I
was
in
earth
life
I
was
once
a
bond
servant
with
wrong
ideas
and
foolish
thoughts
of
truth
but
toward
the
last
the
simple
truth
and
an
understanding
of
the
real
life
beyond
were
shown
to
me
and
I
accepted
them
The
truth
had
to
come
to
me
through
sorrow
We
do
not
seek
for
truth
until
we
have
had
a
deep
sorrow
such
as
losing
a
dear
husband
or
friend
then
the
heart
seeks
after
the
truth
and
will
not
let
dogmas
and
creeds
stand
in
the
way
We
are
hungry
to
know
about
the
life
beyond
and
to
learn
if
our
dear
ones
and
friends
are
with
us
to
guide
and
help
I
felt
the
loss
of
my
dear
husband
so
keenly
that
I
was
brokenhearted
I
could
not
think
that
I
would
not
be
with
him
and
near
him
again
but
the
light
of
truth
and
the
understanding
that
there
is
no
death
came
to
me
and
I
felt
him
around
me
This
beautiful
truth
will
come
to
everyone
who
earnestly
seeks
after
it
and
after
finding
it
we
must
stand
for
it
in
all
honesty
and
sincerity
because
if
we
do
not
doubt
will
come
in
and
fear
and
shut
the
door
for
our
dear
ones
who
have
only
gone
ahead
to
prepare
our
home
everlasting
How
we
mortals
are
clothed
with
doubt
and
when
the
truth
of
continued
existence
is
presented
to
us
even
then
we
doubt
The
Bible
is
full
of
the
beautiful
truth
which
is
revealed
to
us
but
still
we
all
doubt
When
I
found
the
truth
I
wanted
to
teach
it
to
the
world
but
my
physical
body
was
not
strong
enough
to
do
what
I
should
have
liked
I
tried
to
tell
it
to
the
soldiers
because
I
knew
that
to
them
the
truth
would
be
a
Godsend
because
they
were
here
today
and
tomorrow
there
Should
I
not
when
I
had
found
the
truth
give
them
the
understanding
that
there
is
no
death
They
then
felt
that
they
could
go
right
on
and
fight
because
they
realized
that
death
was
not
the
end
of
life
It
would
only
be
the
clothing
the
body
which
would
be
destroyed
How
courageous
and
how
happy
they
were
when
I
said
to
them
that
there
is
no
death
only
a
transition
to
a
happier
and
more
beautiful
state
and
I
wished
so
much
that
I
could
give
them
more
I
spent
my
life
in
dogmas
all
my
life
in
trying
to
do
good
I
did
good
but
my
thoughts
were
clothed
with
dogmas
of
different
kinds
At
last
I
found
the
truth
Oh
my
dear
Robert
had
to
go
to
open
the
door
before
I
could
realize
what
was
awaiting
me
I
did
some
good
after
I
found
the
truth
let
us
all
do
the
same
People
will
scoff
at
you
at
times
but
never
mind
never
mind
By
so
doing
you
will
become
stronger
and
you
will
find
that
it
will
help
you
to
grow
in
understanding
I
found
the
truth
but
by
a
dangerous
method
I
had
to
struggle
as
well
with
that
The
Ouija
Board
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
I
found
it
out
It
greatly
weakened
me
Be
very
guarded
in
seeking
for
the
truth
for
it
is
a
dangerous
road
You
must
learn
the
way
in
order
to
have
help
and
guidance
I
had
struggles
with
others
because
I
went
into
the
midst
of
earthbound
spirits
as
well
as
the
soldiers
If
you
could
only
realize
the
dreadful
pressure
around
the
soldiers
They
wanted
light
on
one
side
as
well
as
on
the
other
Spirits
yet
in
ignorance
of
the
higher
life
It
was
too
much
pressure
on
my
physical
body
and
I
gave
out
I
could
not
stand
it
or
the
thoughts
that
were
centered
on
me
I
taught
the
truth
to
the
soldiers
on
earth
but
I
did
not
realize
how
many
I
lectured
to
who
had
gone
before
The
strain
was
too
great
for
me
so
I
came
home
not
weak
in
spirit
but
in
body
Still
I
feel
happy
that
I
was
enabled
to
help
I
found
the
world
of
spirits
where
I
could
be
with
my
dear
one
whom
I
loved
the
most
You
wonder
where
the
real
life
is
The
real
life
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
grave
as
you
call
it
This
life
is
only
a
temporary
school
the
school
of
learning
to
know
ourselves
and
for
what
object
we
are
here
People
think
that
when
they
die
they
will
see
God
but
how
few
realize
what
God
means
God
is
the
Life
of
all
things
How
little
people
think
of
this
earth
plane
and
what
it
really
is
It
is
only
an
infinitesimal
part
of
the
Universe
Once
I
thought
of
reincarnation
I
was
at
one
time
a
Theosophist
Theosophy
is
all
right
so
far
as
it
goes
the
thoughts
and
teachings
are
beautiful
but
why
should
we
reincarnate
on
this
little
planet
I
would
not
care
to
come
back
to
the
earth
plane
except
to
tell
you
of
the
higher
and
real
life
which
lies
before
you
I
would
not
like
to
come
back
to
this
earth
plane
again
to
be
a
little
baby
and
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
for
what
would
I
learn
Could
souls
like
we
come
back
into
children
again
and
feel
satisfied
After
you
have
learned
the
higher
things
of
life
you
do
not
care
to
come
back
to
matter
another
time
You
want
to
learn
while
here
and
gain
sufficient
knowledge
so
that
when
you
pass
on
you
will
not
want
to
come
back
and
learn
it
over
You
can
learn
much
about
the
other
side
of
life
while
here
and
when
you
pass
over
there
you
will
learn
more
and
more
of
things
which
you
could
not
learn
while
here
because
you
could
not
understand
them
Oh
the
world
of
worlds
If
you
could
only
travel
to
the
beautiful
worlds
beyond
and
see
the
grandeur
there
We
also
have
to
serve
to
bring
others
to
the
same
harmony
we
enjoy
We
cannot
return
and
be
babies
again
but
we
step
down
to
earth
life
to
help
our
loved
ones
and
friends
There
was
a
time
when
I
thought
I
had
reincarnated
because
when
I
would
write
I
felt
that
I
had
been
here
before
but
I
find
that
it
was
only
spirits
who
sent
the
thoughts
to
my
mind
and
gave
me
strength
to
write
and
in
that
way
I
felt
that
I
had
been
here
before
It
was
only
another
s
mind
reflecting
on
my
mind
The
work
you
are
doing
here
is
one
I
wish
I
had
known
about
and
could
have
helped
with
because
it
is
so
much
needed
So
many
need
help
and
enlightenment
We
cannot
reach
many
from
our
side
of
life
because
they
are
bond
servants
to
creeds
and
desires
of
different
kinds
which
attract
them
to
this
earth
plane
We
must
have
stations
like
this
where
we
can
bring
them
and
open
their
spiritual
eyes
that
they
may
see
Then
they
will
see
us
and
we
can
help
them
to
a
better
understanding
Let
us
all
try
to
concentrate
for
training
schools
where
earthbound
spirits
can
be
brought
for
enlightenment
You
may
be
surprised
to
think
I
came
tonight
I
have
tried
to
come
through
Ouija
Boards
and
I
have
tried
to
come
other
ways
but
here
I
can
step
in
and
talk
as
you
talk
It
is
like
talking
through
a
telephone
and
I
feel
strong
I
feel
now
that
I
am
amongst
you
really
in
body
and
in
spirit
We
must
all
unite
and
do
all
we
can
to
further
this
work
because
we
want
stations
like
this
here
there
and
everywhere
In
time
you
will
have
receivers
which
will
record
messages
from
our
side
of
life
It
will
not
be
long
before
a
message
will
come
over
this
receiver
from
the
other
world
that
will
awaken
the
people
from
their
creeds
It
will
awaken
the
churches
Churches
will
be
empty
but
it
will
only
be
for
a
short
time
because
a
new
religion
will
spring
up
a
religion
which
will
be
founded
on
the
truth
of
spirit
return
and
not
on
dogma
People
will
live
for
others
and
will
not
grasp
all
for
themselves
The
churches
will
be
for
the
people
and
not
for
creeds
People
will
pay
money
to
the
church
but
it
will
be
to
further
the
work
of
the
beautiful
truth
of
the
life
beyond
There
will
not
be
any
salvation
but
you
will
learn
to
know
that
we
are
with
you
There
will
be
churches
which
will
have
open
doors
for
the
spirits
as
well
as
the
mortals
I
wanted
to
come
to
California
to
see
your
work
while
I
was
on
earth
as
I
had
heard
of
you
and
was
very
much
interested
in
your
pamphlet
and
your
work
I
wrote
a
little
about
it
but
I
thought
I
could
do
more
if
I
could
see
you
in
person
However
I
went
to
the
spirit
life
before
I
could
meet
you
Now
I
am
here
to
see
your
work
If
you
could
only
realize
what
vast
numbers
invisibles
there
are
outside
the
door
who
are
waiting
for
a
chance
to
come
in
to
learn
the
truth
of
life
and
how
they
are
crowding
each
other
for
help
Now
I
cannot
take
more
of
your
time
but
I
do
thank
you
for
letting
me
come
I
am
glad
if
I
can
be
of
some
service
to
you
in
your
work
Have
courage
People
refuse
to
recognize
the
fact
of
obsession
because
they
think
it
hurts
the
cause
spirit

I
believed
in
it
thoroughly
because
it
is
true
and
I
knew
it
I
am
Ella
Wheeler
Wilcox
I
wanted
to
come
here
to
give
you
encouragement
in
your
work
Go
on
with
the
work
of
obsession
because
it
is
so
much
needed
and
we
will
give
you
help
from
this
side
of
life
Please
understand
I
would
have
been
here
in
your
concentration
circle
before
but
the
door
is
crowded
with
people
who
are
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
come
We
have
to
come
one
by
one
This
evening
I
am
very
happy
to
say
was
my
turn
This
work
is
so
much
needed
to
help
humanity
There
is
only
one
other
that
I
know
of
who
has
such
concentration
circles
where
the
medium
allows
earthbound
spirits
to
control
There
are
very
few
indeed
who
will
allow
earthbound
spirits
to
come
in
and
control
For
my
part
I
know
only
one
other
and
I
have
been
hunting
for
some
time
to
see
where
the
work
could
be
done
The
work
of
obsession
as
carried
on
by
you
should
be
done
in
every
town
and
city
Every
medium
should
be
willing
to
do
this
line
of
work
The
time
will
come
when
every
minister
will
speak
regarding
the
philosophy
of
life
and
spirit
return
and
all
isms
will
be
done
away
with
I
cannot
stay
any
longer
but
I
thank
you
very
much
for
the
privilege
of
coming
and
shall
come
again
some
time
I
hope

Good
Evening
my
friends
I
thank
you
for
opening
the
door
so
I
could
bring
in
the
ones
that
are
in
misery
and
have
them
find
understanding
I
like
to
be
here
with
you
and
I
like
to
help
you
with
your
work
Doctor
Whoever
you
are
you
are
very
welcome
Sp
You
know
who
I
am
you
know
This
is
Dr
Peebles
I
am
young
now
I
was
always
young
in
spirit
but
my
body
commenced
to
grow
old
and
I
could
not
always
do
as
I
wished
I
should
very
much
have
liked
to
live
to
be
one
hundred
years
old
but
I
could
not
I
had
a
most
beautiful
celebration
on
my
hundredth
birthday
in
the
spirit
world
among
friends
I
was
very
glad
to
go
When
I
reached
the
spirit
world
I
was
glad
to
find
such
glory
and
happiness
and
beauty
I
understood
about
the
spirit
world
but
it
cannot
be
described
I
cannot
tell
you
how
it
is
when
we
have
understanding
Even
though
I
had
been
a
Spiritualist
for
many
many
years
still
I
clung
to
dogma
as
well
I
was
a
Spiritualist
on
one
side
but
I
could
not
give
up
the
dogma
of
the
Christian
religion
it
was
my
hoodoo
I
traveled
around
the
world
five
times
saw
many
conditions
of
life
and
heard
many
different
lectures
on
the
Great
Truth
Let
us
not
have
beliefs
Let
us
only
learn
to
understand
the
grandeur
of
God
Realize
that
this
little
earth
is
only
a
grammar
school
It
is
not
a
University
not
even
a
High
School
it
is
only
the
first
lesson
of
life
Many
do
not
learn
in
that
school
Dr
Who
had
been
discussing
reincarnation
with
a
member
of
the
circle
jestingly
They
reincarnate
again
Sp
Earnestly
No
they
do
not
Why
should
you
want
to
come
back
again
Why
should
you
go
back
to
be
confined
in
a
small
body
and
have
no
will
of
your
own
In
the
spirit
world
you
are
free
to
travel
everywhere
you
do
not
need
a
physical
body
Why
go
back
into
that
prison
again
Why
should
a
child
ready
to
enter
High
School
go
back
to
the
Sixth
Seventh
or
Eighth
grade
Those
of
you
who
are
here
at
the
present
time
when
you
have
learned
the
primary
lesson
of
life
would
you
like
to
go
back
into
a
small
body
and
know
nothing
When
you
travel
you
learn
You
can
learn
in
one
day
here
what
it
takes
ten
or
twelve
years
to
learn
on
earth
If
you
feel
like
seeing
things
you
travel
During
my
life
I
studied
Reincarnation
and
also
Mrs
Cora
Richmond
s
Re
embodiment
Ques
What
is
Re
embodiment
Dr
It
is
a
projection
of
self
into
the
physical
to
acquire
certain
experiences
Sp
She
believed
you
had
to
have
many
experiences
that
you
had
to
be
a
murderer
a
thief
a
salesman
a
tailor
that
you
must
learn
all
the
trades
and
professions
Why
can
t
you
learn
these
experiences
through
others
If
you
come
in
contact
with
a
man
you
do
not
need
to
be
perfect
to
profit
by
his
experience
You
can
learn
by
object
lessons
We
teach
children
by
object
lessons
and
so
it
is
through
life
In
the
spirit
world
if
you
wish
to
see
a
big
factory
making
all
sorts
of
machinery
you
can
as
a
spirit
go
there
by
thinking
and
can
learn
all
about
it
If
you
want
to
learn
what
they
are
doing
in
other
parts
of
the
world
in
Russia
Germany
England
Indian
Australia
think
and
you
are
there
and
so
learn
your
lessons
Should
you
then
be
born
again
All
you
learn
in
life
is
only
like
a
day
in
spirit
I
do
not
mean
you
grasp
it
all
at
once
You
have
nothing
to
hold
you
when
you
are
free
remember
a
free
spirit
free
and
open
to
learn
Dr
For
instance
here
when
we
want
to
know
what
is
in
a
book
we
have
to
go
through
it
In
the
spirit
world
I
presume
you
sense
the
contents
Sp
Yes
you
sense
it
by
feeling
When
you
are
in
the
body
you
have
to
act
through
the
brain
and
it
is
difficult
but
in
the
spirit
world
you
are
free
You
have
no
brain
to
interfere
Life
is
everlasting
Everything
you
have
learned
through
life
that
belongs
to
the
soul
is
stored
in
your
memory
but
so
long
as
you
live
in
the
material
body
the
cells
clog
up
You
lose
your
memory
because
the
spirit
cannot
work
on
the
brain
cells
as
well
in
old
age
as
in
youth
The
cells
are
not
so
active
and
there
are
times
when
memory
is
shut
out
There
are
times
when
you
feel
like
a
drowning
man
everything
stands
before
you
things
which
have
been
forgotten
As
spirits
we
have
our
memory
but
when
we
come
back
and
control
a
medium
sometimes
even
our
names
are
forgotten
We
get
into
another
body
very
much
like
obsession
Dr
That
must
be
a
form
of
obsession
Sp
No
it
is
not
When
obsession
takes
place
the
spirit
clings
to
that
body
and
it
is
hard
to
let
go
I
would
say
that
there
is
not
one
person
on
earth
who
is
not
obsessed
in
one
way
or
another
You
know
in
olden
times
when
I
was
a
young
boy
life
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
now
We
did
not
hurry
because
there
was
nothing
to
hurry
for
Now
life
is
all
hurry
People
are
living
too
rapid
a
life
If
a
man
does
not
work
fast
they
say
Quit
him
if
he
does
not
do
that
and
that
Quit
him
Nowadays
people
have
to
be
so
keen
that
the
nervous
system
fails
and
they
lose
themselves
then
the
spirits
step
in
If
you
were
a
clairvoyant
and
walked
down
some
busy
street
You
would
be
surprised
to
find
how
many
persons
have
invisible
company
Very
few
people
on
entering
the
spirit
side
of
life
even
among
the
Spiritualists
who
preach
it
understand
the
condition
of
the
higher
life
Dr
They
usually
care
only
for
phenomena
they
do
not
care
for
philosophy
Sp
Tonight
I
brought
about
one
hundred
spirits
here
At
first
I
lectured
to
them
and
tried
to
waken
them
but
could
not
Then
I
saw
the
English
lady
spirit
who
preceded
him
in
controlling
psychic
and
from
her
actions
I
thought
she
would
listen
but
she
would
not
So
she
was
allowed
to
control
Mrs
Wickland
and
served
as
an
object
lesson
The
other
spirits
were
watching
her
as
they
thought
she
acted
so
strangely
They
were
curious
so
they
roused
themselves
and
woke
up
then
I
could
talk
You
may
think
that
sometimes
we
bring
in
strange
spirits
but
it
is
to
help
many
others
as
well
as
to
give
the
controlling
spirit
an
understanding
of
spiritual
things
Forget
Reincarnation
because
it
is
a
sandbag
around
your
neck
You
will
have
that
so
centered
in
your
mind
that
you
will
think
and
think
about
only
that
and
then
you
will
stay
just
where
you
are
You
cannot
progress
because
your
mind
will
always
revert
to
the
earth
again
and
that
Gate
which
was
opened
for
the
English
lady
could
never
be
opened
to
any
one
who
believed
in
reincarnation
The
thought
of
it
is
so
self
hypnotizing
and
so
self
satisfying
that
there
is
nothing
in
your
mind
except
coming
back
and
those
are
real
selfish
thoughts
You
wrap
yourself
in
those
thoughts
and
you
remain
just
where
you
are
You
cannot
reincarnate
I
have
seen
the
effect
of
such
thoughts
and
have
also
talked
with
people
who
believed
in
reincarnation
Ques
What
does
Madam
Blavatsky
think
about
reincarnation
now
Sp
We
had
some
dispute
about
it
when
I
was
on
earth
and
we
have
had
more
since
I
came
here
She
does
not
believe
in
it
now
She
has
had
her
lesson
It
took
a
very
long
time
but
now
all
she
would
like
to
come
back
for
would
be
to
correct
her
mistakes
Dr
That
is
hard
to
do
Sp
I
had
my
hobby
I
thought
I
should
see
Christ
I
have
not
seen
Him
and
never
will
Christ
is
the
Principle
of
God
Christ
is
the
Principle
of
Life
Jesus
is
Truth
and
Christ
is
Enlightenment
and
Understanding
When
you
have
found

Chap
Page
M
Spirit
Esther
Sutherland
yourself
and
learn
to
be
one
with
your
Maker
that
is
At
OneMent
with
God
Through
Jesus
you
find
the
Truth
and
Jesus
has
to
be
crucified
that
Christ
may
live
We
must
overcome
earthly
things
Crucify
selfishness
and
jealousy
on
the
cross
Truth
cannot
be
selfish
or
jealous
selfishness
and
jealousy
belong
to
the
lower
part
of
man
Do
not
become
hypnotized
in
any
way
by
dogma
creed
or
belief
but
find
God
within
yourself
and
be
free
Ask
to
hear
to
see
to
feel
and
to
know
God
then
your
eyes
will
be
opened
to
spiritual
things
and
you
will
not
want
to
come
back
to
this
earth
life
again
You
could
not
live
on
earth
more
than
once
no
no
You
cannot
light
again
a
candle
that
has
burned
out
Life
is
progression
not
retrogression
You
go
from
one
degree
to
another
and
so
on
and
on
In
the
spirit
world
your
time
is
so
taken
up
with
duties
that
you
have
no
time
to
think
of
coming
back
You
want
to
see
your
friends
and
you
want
to
travel
because
you
can
see
all
you
want
to
when
you
are
free
and
have
understanding
Many
ask
How
about
children
who
have
passed
out
and
have
not
had
earth
life
experience
They
have
it
The
spirit
of
the
mother
s
love
brings
the
children
to
her
often
they
are
around
her
and
in
this
way
learn
of
earth
life
They
are
also
taught
We
have
in
the
spirit
world
teachers
of
higher
things
and
they
teach
by
object
lessons
We
take
children
to
schools
of
various
kinds
and
teach
them
God
s
wonders
There
they
learn
the
real
life
not
merely
reading
and
writing
They
learn
the
real
lessons
anatomy
astrology
astronomy
and
many
other
subjects
Those
are
the
studies
of
the
children
and
the
masters
therein
are
teaching
the
lessons
Our
schools
teach
progression
to
a
higher
life
I
wish
you
could
open
your
eyes
to
see
how
rapidly
the
children
progress
by
object
lessons
I
want
to
tell
you
that
I
am
with
you
in
your
work
I
want
you
to
understand
that
I
have
not
left
you
People
are
lost
for
lack
of
a
real
understanding
of
life
Obsession
is
very
very
bad
Insane
asylums
are
filled
and
the
doctors
do
not
know
what
to
do
to
stop
insanity
Let
us
have
more
love
for
each
other
let
us
all
help
the
weak
ones
and
reach
the
point
where
all
are
brothers
and
sisters
When
that
time
comes
everybody
will
work
just
half
the
time
they
do
now
they
will
have
more
time
for
themselves
and
will
have
more
pleasures
Now
half
the
people
are
idle
and
are
a
detriment
to
themselves
and
the
world
at
large
If
all
would
work
for
others
and
not
have
such
unrest
it
would
be
better
for
everybody
Now
I
must
not
say
any
more
but
must
go
Good
Night
Very
unexpectedly
we
had
a
visit
from
the
one
whose
teachings
and
writings
have
made
world
wide
the
theory
of
Reincarnation
EXPERIENCE

MADAM
BLAVATSKY
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
wanted
to
come
to
you
this
evening
I
believe
in
the
work
this
little
circle
is
doing
and
I
am
very
pleased
with
the
work
you
are
carrying
on
I
wish
there
were
more
to
help
us
to
meet
us
on
a
half
way
basis
to
understand
there
is
no
death
I
do
wish
I
had
taught
this
truth
more
and
also
that
I
had
tried
to
look
further
into
it
I
knew
about
it
I
also
had
many
manifestations
I
do
not
know
why
but
when
truth
comes
to
us
we
shut
it
out
Truth
is
always
hidden
We
have
to
search
to
find
it
Theories
and
dogmas
seem
to
have
more
chance
in
the
world
than
truth
Every
one
has
some
manifestations
but
hides
them
instead
of
acknowledging
them
I
wanted
to
be
a
leader
in
some
way
or
another
Now
I
want
to
bring
the
truth
to
the
world
I
knew
of
spirit
manifestations
and
I
had
them
myself
I
did
a
great
deal
in
my
early
days
along
this
line
but
I
commenced
to
investigate
Theosophy
Philosophy
and
Theosophy
should
go
hand
in
hand
To
me
came
Reincarnation
It
appealed
to
me
for
a
time
I
could
not
see
the
truth
clearly
I
felt
that
it
was
very
unjust
some
should
be
rich
and
have
such
good
times
and
that
others
should
be
poor
and
have
so
much
trouble
Others
did
not
get
enough
earth
experience
at
least
so
I
felt
I
studied
Reincarnation
and
I
thought
there
was
truth
and
justice
in
the
theory
that
we
come
back
and
learn
and
have
more
experiences
I
taught
it
and
wanted
to
bring
it
out
to
the
world
and
its
peoples
I
felt
that
I
remembered
far
back
in
my
past
I
felt
I
knew
all
about
my
past
but
I
was
mistaken
Memories
of
past
lives
are
caused
by
spirits
that
bring
such
thoughts
and
represent
the
lives
they
lived
A
spirit
impresses
you
with
the
experiences
of
its
life
and
these
are
implanted
in
your
mind
as
your
own
You
then
think
you
remember
your
past
When
you
study
especially
when
you
study
Theosophy
you
develop
your
mind
and
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
mind
You
remove
yourself
as
much
as
possible
from
the
physical
Naturally
you
become
sensitive
and
naturally
you
feel
the
spirits
around
you
They
speak
to
you
by
impressions
and
their
past
will
be
like
a
panorama
You
feel
it
and
you
live
over
the
past
of
spirits
and
you
make
the
mistake
of
taking
this
for
the
memory
of
former
incarnations
I
did
not
know
this
when
I
lived
I
took
it
for
granted
that
these
memories
were
true
but
when
I
came
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
learned
differently
I
studied
a
great
deal
Theosophy
is
the
best
and
highest
philosophy
of
life
intrinsically
but
let
us
study
the
truth
let
us
live
up
to
the
truth
of
it
and
forget
theories
Let
us
develop
the
truth
within
us
find
ourselves
Do
not
let
us
look
far
away
do
not
let
us
look
in
the
past
do
not
let
us
look
into
the
future
but
let
us
find
ourselves
in
our
present
condition
and
let
us
be
true
to
ourselves
Let
us
forget
all
theories
and
dogmas
Let
us
know
and
feel
the
nearness
of
God
Reincarnation
is
not
true
I
did
not
want
to
believe
that
They
told
me
here
in
the
spirit
world
that
I
could
not
reincarnate
I
have
tried
and
tried
to
come
back
to
be
somebody
else
but
I
could
not
We
cannot
reincarnate
We
progress
we
do
not
come
back
Why
should
you
come
back
to
live
another
life
when
you
have
gained
experience
and
an
understanding
while
you
were
here
and
furthermore
since
this
is
only
a
preliminary
school
on
earth
Let
us
learn
to
find
ourselves
While
I
am
sorry
to
say
many
have
not
found
themselves
let
all
of
us
here
acquire
knowledge
so
that
when
we
go
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
we
shall
go
on
to
a
higher
life
In
earth
life
you
have
your
material
body
to
hinder
you
If
you
want
to
write
a
book
you
have
to
look
up
data
here
and
there
and
go
to
the
library
to
find
some
book
that
contains
what
you
wish
to
know
You
may
have
to
go
from
one
place
to
another
and
yet
not
find
it
It
all
takes
time
and
time
is
limited
You
are
hindered
In
the
spirit
world
if
we
want
data
on
a
certain
thing
we
think
of
it
and
it
is
all
before
us
There
is
no
time
no
matter
to
hinder
In
the
spirit
world
if
we
want
earthly
experience
do
you
think
we
have
to
reincarnate
to
get
that
experience
No
we
do
not
For
illustration
say
one
wants
to
know
more
about
medicine
He
then
goes
to
a
school
as
a
student
hears
everything
sees
everything
and
comes
in
contact
with
everything
learning
it
much
quicker
than
he
could
grasp
it
on
earth
and
he
has
it
much
clearer
in
his
mind
In
earth
life
you
have
to
study
for
years
and
then
you
do
not
get
it
as
clearly
as
we
do
Suppose
you
want
experience
in
the
spirit
world
with
machinery
or
anything
else
you
can
get
it
easily
We
have
everything
in
the
spirit
world
because
everything
that
is
invented
on
earth
has
first
been
invented
in
the
spirit
world
Suppose
an
inventor
passes
on
before
completion
of
his
invention
He
will
not
give
it
up
He
studies
it
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
because
it
is
easier
to
study
there
as
he
has
more
time
When
he
has
everything
ready
he
finds
some
sensitive
and
impresses
the
invention
on
his
mind
Then
that
one
commences
on
it
perfects
it
and
gives
it
to
the
world
If
I
impress
a
sensitive
with
an
idea
in
one
sense
I
reincarnate
not
in
his
body
but
by
impressing
him
with
what
I
want
done
In
this
way
we
come
and
go
if
we
are
attracted
to
earth
life
and
want
to
be
here
When
you
have
once
reached
the
spirit
world
where
all
are
congenial
where
all
is
life
where
all
is
bliss
where
there
is
no
jealousy
no
envy
where
all
is
one
grand
harmony
do
you
think
for
one
moment
that
you
would
want
to
leave
that
beautiful
condition
to
come
back
to
earth
and
be
a
little
baby
restricted
in
mind
and
knowing
nothing
nothing
whatever
Furthermore
you
might
get
into
a
sickly
crippled
body
and
be
worse
than
you
were
before
No
reincarnation
is
not
true
I
believed
it
I
taught
it
and
I
was
sure
that
I
should
come
back
and
be
somebody
else
But
I
will
not
I
can
do
far
more
good
now
If
I
want
to
do
some
missionary
work
or
some
good
I
go
down
to
the
earth
sphere
the
earthbound
sphere
where
the
spirits
are
in
all
kinds
of
misery
I
preach
to
them
and
teach
them
I
try
to
rescue
them
So
I
find
my
work
Why
should
we
go
down
from
the
harmony
in
the
spirit
world
to
what
I
might
call
hell
Here
we
have
one
group
singing
and
praying
and
praising
God
from
early
morning
until
night
and
they
are
so
selfhypnotized
that
we
cannot
talk
to
them
We
go
to
another
group
and
there
we
find
the
misers
They
are
so
busy
counting
money
money
which
is
their
God
that
we
cannot
reach
them
We
go
to
others
who
have
been
ruined
in
life
they
are
bitter
and
jealous
they
have
nothing
but
revenge
in
their
minds
They
have
no
love
or
kindness
They
are
like
sponges
which
have
been
dipped
in
muddy
water
you
would
not
even
know
they
were
sponges
Their
love
has
turned
to
hate
and
they
cannot
be
taught
love
and
kindness
They
will
spit
at
you
they
will
laugh
at
you
for
they
feel
that
there
is
no
God
no
kindness
no
love
but
all
is
jealousy
and
selfishness
But
we
are
not
disappointed
our
mission
is
to
turn
these
souls
to
better
things
We
may
have
a
hard
time
We
cannot
go
there
and
pray
for
them
no
no
They
would
shut
the
door
and
say
they
did
not
want
us
and
so
we
cannot
go
there
and
talk
and
lecture
You
may
ask
how
it
is
possible
to
reach
them
First
we
try
to
concentrate
on
them
Then
we
have
music
Sometimes
we
have
to
play
very
softly
so
they
can
hardly
hear
it
then
we
play
a
little
louder
No
matter
how
evil
how
mean
how
low
souls
have
been
they
will
listen
to
music
When
they
have
given
their
attention
to
the
music
we
concentrate
on
them
to
waken
and
look
up
to
higher
things
Artists
then
paint
pictures
of
the
higher
life
for
them
object
lessons
little
stories
Their
life
history
can
be
seen
by
us
and
we
put
this
in
pictures
one
by
one
and
let
them
see
the
mistakes
they
have
made
Presently
they
ask
questions
and
then
we
come
a
little
closer
to
them
After
that
we
take
them
to
the
higher
life
In
another
group
are
those
who
are
self
hypnotized
They
have
gone
to
sleep
They
were
taught
that
death
is
a
sleep
and
that
they
will
sleep
until
the
Last
Day
when
God
will
sit
on
His
throne
and
judge
them
They
are
difficult
to
reach
especially
if
they
have
put
themselves
into
an
actual
death
sleep
Sometimes
we
have
to
bring
them
to
control
a
medium
and
waken
them
in
that
way
When
we
cannot
reach
the
earthbound
spirits
at
all
we
have
to
bring
them
to
earth
life
to
a
circle
like
this
where
they
get
understanding
through
matter
In
one
sense
you
can
call
this
reincarnation
because
we
have
to
bring
them
to
matter
to
find
themselves
I
wish
we
could
have
more
circles
like
this
to
waken
these
spirits
and
make
them
understand
about
the
life
beyond
Some
may
say
this
is
not
Madam
Blavatsky
but
do
not
doubt
it
is
They
may
say
She
would
not
say
so
and
so
she
would
not
talk
so
and
so
but
it
is
Madam
Blavatsky
If
you
have
any
questions
you
would
like
to
ask
I
will
try
to
answer
them
Ques
Will
you
tell
us
about
the
Masters
What
do
you
think
of
them
by
now
Sp
We
talk
of
Masters
yes
We
are
all
masters
when
we
try
to
study
higher
things
but
a
Master
as
we
understand
it
in
Theosophy
is
some
big
and
great
mind
A
master
is
one
who
can
master
matter
can
overcome
matter
one
who
can
live
a
pure
and
good
life
and
master
the
conditions
of
life
Learn
the
lessons
of
Nature
learn
how
to
progress
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
most
of
those
who
want
to
be
Masters
on
earth
fall
It
is
not
they
themselves
who
fall
but
they
become
so
sensitive
so
psychic
that
although
they
do
not
know
they
are
on
the
borderland
earthbound
spirits
step
in
control
them
and
they
fall
We
should
master
matter
first
before
we
try
to
master
new
ideas
Take
myself
what
did
I
really
do
that
was
good
for
humanity
Ans
You
led
many
out
of
orthodoxy
Sp
Yes
but
I
only
gave
them
more
theory
I
could
have
done
oh
so
much
more
if
I
had
stayed
with
my
mediumship
and
worked
to
bring
this
world
and
the
other
together
I
was
a
medium
and
I
could
have
done
a
great
work
but
I
became
obsessed
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
Theosophists
are
breaking
up
You
live
now
in
a
time
when
things
are
breaking
up
there
is
a
general
restlessness
All
theories
will
go
down
and
philosophy
will
rise
Dr
There
should
be
more
simplicity
in
life
Sp
That
is
a
very
good
word
to
apply
You
have
found
the
truth
You
have
good
workers
on
the
other
side
connected
with
this
medium
You
have
no
theories
no
mysterious
things
as
Theosophists
have
They
think
the
more
mysterious
they
are
the
greater
Masters
they
are
Where
are
they
Where
are
they
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
they
are
so
self
hypnotized
that
their
imagination
runs
away
with
them
One
may
look
back
and
say
I
was
Julius
Caesar
He
has
probably
read
some
book
about
Julius
Caesar
and
become
so
wrapped
up
in
it
that
he
feels
he
has
lived
in
that
time
Then
he
receives
spirit
impressions
and
is
sure
that
this
was
his
former
life
You
can
make
people
believe
almost
anything
They
do
not
build
their
houses
on
the
rock
of
reason
for
a
storm
will
blow
them
down
All
denominations
have
some
truth
You
have
heard
the
story
of
the
elephant
Of
the
blind
men
who
examined
an
elephant
and
each
declared
that
an
elephant
was
like
that
part
which
he
had
touched
like
the
trunk
the
leg
or
the
tail
Every
one
had
the
truth
but
none
the
whole
truth
We
do
not
seek
for
the
whole
truth
so
one
hangs
on
to
the
tail
another
to
the
trunk
and
so
on
Let
us
all
join
together
then
we
will
find
the
whole
elephant
and
we
will
all
be
together
in
one
great
truth
Ques
Will
there
be
psychics
to
carry
on
further
investigations
Sp
When
the
time
comes
and
the
people
are
ready
the
psychics
will
be
ready
also
We
can
all
join
together
then
and
there
will
be
psychic
circles
in
every
church
Ques
Why
are
there
not
more
inspirational
speakers
to
teach
the
truth
Sp
The
public
lecture
work
will
be
inspirational
Lecturers
and
politicians
often
think
they
are
going
to
say
what
they
have
written
down
but
before
they
know
it
they
speak
of
something
altogether
different
They
are
speaking
inspirationally
for
there
are
always
those
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
who
are
interested
in
this
life
and
are
ready
to
inspire
a
speaker
Ques
Will
a
psychic
be
protected
Sp
One
should
always
be
positive
in
ordinary
life
cure
disappointment
never
let
anything
disturb
one
No
anger
or
sorrow
may
creep
in
because
anger
comes
from
the
other
side
the
lower
sphere
Everyone
must
be
positive
When
we
open
the
door
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
there
are
crowds
of
earthbound
spirits
who
want
to
see
the
light
which
they
can
see
through
a
mortal
body
Having
lost
their
physical
sight
they
are
blind
for
there
is
no
material
light
in
the
earth
sphere
and
without
an
understanding
they
have
no
spiritual
light
Ques
Should
not
a
psychic
be
well
informed
on
all
subjects
Sp
Suppose
a
great
musician
had
to
play
on
a
poor
piano
He
could
not
bring
out
the
shading
of
the
music
in
any
way
He
must
have
a
fine
instrument
So
it
is
with
a
psychic
A
psychic
should
be
informed
on
all
topics
regarding
the
world
An
uncultured
psychic
cannot
be
used
to
speak
properly
on
scientific
subjects
Ques
What
becomes
of
the
spirit
of
a
psychic
while
another
spirit
is
controlling
Sp
You
understand
that
in
spirit
we
can
be
large
or
small
as
we
think
The
spirit
of
Mrs
Wickland
at
the
present
time
is
in
her
magnetic
aura
There
can
be
a
number
of
spirits
in
one
aura
Some
come
and
some
go
but
only
one
can
control
at
a
time
Mrs
Wickland
just
now
is
in
a
coma
state
She
does
not
function
on
the
mental
plane
She
is
the
live
wire
she
is
the
battery
She
is
the
motor
and
we
have
many
lines
from
that
motor
If
she
left
we
would
not
have
the
electrical
force
to
control
In
this
case
the
psychic
is
the
battery
through
which
we
work
Ques
Theosophy
teaches
that
during
sleep
one
develops
mentally
and
spiritually
that
the
body
will
stay
at
rest
but
the
soul
will
leave
the
body
connected
only
by
a
slender
thread
And
gain
experience
on
the
mental
or
astral
plane
Is
that
true
Sp
Yes
it
is
When
you
sleep
you
often
dream
Some
dreams
are
meaningless
others
are
real
experiences
When
you
study
Yoga
you
learn
to
leave
the
body
Hindus
study
Yoga
and
leave
the
body
at
will
Most
persons
do
not
know
that
they
leave
the
body
and
travel
in
the
spirit
world
Ques
Would
it
be
desirable
to
have
continuous
consciousness
Sp
If
humanity
had
continuous
consciousness
it
would
be
a
big
factor
in
the
welfare
of
this
world
God
is
All
in
All
even
to
the
little
microscopic
things
He
is
all
Life
If
all
were
taught
this
simple
truth
earth
life
would
become
ideal
There
is
no
death
only
progression
All
should
be
taught
that
Selfishness
ignorance
and
jealousy
would
be
gone
then
doubt
would
be
buried
Love
and
charity
would
rule
Suppose
you
go
out
of
your
body
You
pass
through
the
first
strata
what
do
you
find
Selfishness
You
have
to
pass
through
this
first
strata
before
you
can
reach
the
higher
Ignorance
selfishness
and
jealousy
must
be
passed
through
before
you
can
reach
the
better
life
It
is
a
case
of
development
The
Hindus
have
peace
and
harmony
They
live
for
higher
things
although
I
do
not
mean
every
one
in
India
does
this
But
when
the
more
advanced
leave
their
bodies
no
one
can
get
in
and
disturb
them
What
I
want
to
say
tonight
is
that
we
should
study
life
as
it
it
Let
the
dreamers
and
thinkers
of
the
past
take
care
of
themselves
I
see
now
that
I
had
many
earthbound
spirits
around
me
I
never
saw
so
many
religions
in
one
city
as
in
Los
Angeles
People
go
from
one
church
to
another
and
they
do
not
know
where
they
are
at
Cranks
and
others
sing
and
pray
and
everybody
loves
Jesus
Jesus
is
the
Truth
Read
Anna
Kingsford
s
works
and
you
will
find
many
interesting
things
there
She
was
not
a
crank
We
read
many
books
together
She
was
a
wonderful
woman
Dr
Wasn
t
she
opposed
to
mediumship
Sp
She
was
a
medium
herself
Her
writings
were
not
her
own
Writers
have
a
hard
time
When
they
think
they
are
getting
along
very
nicely
their
thoughts
suddenly
change
They
are
influenced
by
some
spirit
writer
All
Anna
Kingsford
s
writings
were
inspirational
Ques
What
about
Olcott
Sp
Olcott
has
found
the
truth
Let
us
be
sensible
and
learn
not
to
be
foolish
Let
us
find
the
simple
truth
I
have
greatly
enjoyed
this
talk
with
all
of
you
and
I
will
certainly
come
again
Do
all
you
can
to
further
this
noble
work
This
room
is
full
of
spirits
who
have
listened
to
what
was
said
tonight
Many
have
been
helped
and
will
go
with
us
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
May
strength
and
power
be
with
you
all
Let
God
s
light
shine
in
your
soul
and
go
on
with
this
good
work
Good
Night
CHAPTER
XVI
Philosophy
THE
philosophy
of
life
and
descriptions
of
conditions
in
the
higher
realms
have
been
given
by
spirits
who
have
attained
enlightenment
and
are
desirous
of
helping
humanity
to
an
understanding
of
the
spiritual
laws
A
friend
of
many
years
standing
formerly
a
Methodist
minister
had
followed
our
work
with
great
interest
and
had
been
a
constant
attendant
at
our
circles
in
which
his
daughter
took
an
active
part
Five
days
after
he
passed
away
he
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
and
several
months
later
spoke
to
us
again
telling
of
his
experiences
in
spirit
life

SR
PSYCHIC
MRS
WICKLAND
Well
I
am
here
again
I
have
been
here
before
many
times
Do
you
know
who
I
am
I
am
Doctor
Y
I
am
glad
that
I
can
be
with
you
here
tonight
and
I
am
pleased
this
circle
is
continuing
We
are
here
every
time
you
have
a
meeting
and
I
wish
you
could
see
the
spirits
who
are
waiting
to
come
in
for
an
understanding
of
life
Life
is
a
great
problem
to
the
world
I
wish
people
would
study
life
and
its
existence
in
matter
It
is
a
shame
to
send
so
many
spirits
out
of
their
bodies
into
the
darkness
of
ignorance
They
only
believe
they
sing
and
praise
God
and
we
cannot
reach
them
They
are
so
self
hypnotized
by
their
religion
in
the
first
place
that
they
do
not
know
they
are
dead
and
in
the
second
place
by
their
praising
of
God
and
singing
that
we
cannot
reach
them
with
the
understanding
that
they
must
praise
God
in
a
different
way
We
must
act
we
must
work
for
humanity
We
must
learn
the
first
lesson
that
Christ
taught
to
serve
others
and
to
love
God
above
all
things
and
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
How
many
do
really
love
God
They
pray
and
sing
but
they
do
not
do
what
the
Bible
teaches
I
understood
a
great
deal
about
the
other
world
and
still
I
was
like
a
child
regarding
that
understanding
because
I
had
not
learned
to
control
matter
and
the
conditions
that
surround
us
When
we
pass
through
the
material
sphere
of
ether
the
sphere
around
this
world
we
pass
through
the
sphere
in
which
are
most
of
the
spirits
of
darkness
which
we
call
earthbound
spirits
There
all
is
selfishness
and
ignorance
These
spirits
must
serve
to
help
themselves
to
a
higher
understanding
for
they
have
not
served
but
have
been
served
in
their
earth
lives
They
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
live
and
do
for
others
they
have
lived
only
for
self
They
are
waiting
to
be
served
Their
minds
have
not
been
developed
to
do
for
others
I
wish
I
could
take
you
to
the
sphere
of
suicides
the
sphere
of
the
churches
the
sphere
of
the
slums
the
sphere
of
the
misers
and
so
on
Here
they
are
in
darkness
crying
for
help
Many
of
them
do
not
know
what
to
do
They
go
to
mortals
and
try
to
control
them
upsetting
their
lives
and
they
are
ignorant
of
what
they
are
doing
Frank
and
Charles
relatives
in
the
spirit
world
have
taken
me
to
all
those
places
and
shown
me
many
things
If
you
could
actually
realize
what
that
means
I
wish
I
could
make
a
picture
for
you
of
all
those
conditions
and
the
agony
of
despair
the
spirits
are
in
They
will
have
to
find
themselves
and
waken
to
a
realization
that
they
must
not
look
for
God
outside
but
within
themselves
When
you
find
this
wonderful
understanding
of
life
and
realize
what
the
object
of
life
is
that
is
glory
No
one
can
do
this
for
you
others
can
only
teach
you
but
you
have
to
work
for
yourself
There
is
no
time
in
the
spirit
world
you
have
all
the
time
in
eternity
to
find
yourself
and
as
soon
as
you
understand
God
in
His
glory
you
will
have
happiness
Then
your
spiritual
eyes
will
be
opened
and
you
will
awaken
to
a
world
of
grandeur
You
will
awaken
and
realize
harmony
and
glory
But
this
is
not
Heaven
Heaven
must
be
found
within
you
There
is
a
world
of
spirits
and
there
is
a
future
life
everlasting
There
you
have
your
homes
as
you
have
made
them
while
here
Nearest
to
the
earth
is
the
City
of
Ignorance
and
the
conditions
in
which
many
awaken
No
matter
how
good
you
have
been
nor
how
well
you
have
lived
your
life
that
alone
is
not
sufficient
If
you
are
ignorant
of
the
life
and
system
of
the
other
side
you
are
in
darkness
for
the
time
being
until
you
awaken
and
realize
that
there
is
a
life
after
this
Each
has
a
home
in
the
spirit
world
made
by
service
to
others
during
earth
life
As
you
have
made
it
here
so
you
will
have
it
there
If
you
have
done
good
acts
and
lived
a
pure
upright
life
doing
the
best
you
know
how
your
home
is
beautiful
But
you
will
not
know
how
to
reach
that
home
if
you
are
ignorant
of
the
laws
governing
the
spirit
world
If
you
have
lived
a
life
of
selfishness
and
lived
only
and
entirely
for
self
your
home
is
a
little
place
that
you
can
hardly
creep
into
and
you
see
nothing
but
self
You
have
no
company
but
your
own
self
You
have
your
thoughts
of
self
you
have
lived
for
self
and
you
have
to
live
in
that
state
of
mind
until
you
ask
God
for
help
and
say
Not
my
will
any
longer
but
Thy
will
Give
me
help
Then
your
spirit
comprehends
the
results
of
your
actions
during
earth
life
You
go
back
to
the
earth
plane
again
and
there
you
have
to
serve
those
whom
you
have
harmed
through
your
selfishness
If
they
are
still
in
earth
life
you
have
to
watch
and
help
them
all
you
can
and
you
will
have
to
serve
them
until
you
have
atoned
for
the
harm
you
have
done
them
while
you
were
on
earth
If
they
have
passed
out
and
are
in
the
dark
you
will
have
to
find
them
and
help
bring
them
to
an
understanding
of
life
and
you
will
have
to
serve
them
until
you
have
paid
your
debt
After
you
have
done
that
you
step
out
of
that
sphere
into
a
higher
sphere
where
your
home
is
Your
home
is
given
to
you
after
you
have
earned
it
Then
your
friends
come
to
you
and
help
you
and
there
is
a
reunion
like
which
there
is
nothing
on
earth
because
that
reunion
with
your
relatives
and
friends
is
a
reunion
in
reality
All
are
like
one
all
are
in
tune
all
are
in
harmony
with
each
other
Just
to
be
able
to
say
I
live
in
the
hearts
of
my
friends
is
great
happiness
The
reunion
that
they
had
for
me
at
the
time
I
passed
out
and
came
to
an
understanding
of
life
can
never
be
described
Many
of
my
friends
I
met
later
and
I
have
been
helping
to
waken
them
to
the
glory
of
understanding
Let
us
not
believe
but
let
us
act
Let
us
all
do
our
duty
while
we
are
here
and
let
us
understand
the
wonders
of
Nature
and
the
wonders
of
God
We
could
not
worship
more
than
God
for
God
is
everything
You
are
one
part
of
His
grand
work
the
flowers
are
another
part
of
His
grand
work
the
animals
another
part
so
how
could
you
be
outside
God
Why
should
you
not
worship
His
manifestations
in
every
way
You
are
in
the
very
midst
of
Him
When
you
are
one
with
God
you
have
great
glory
I
want
to
say
Hallelujah
A
favorite
expression
in
earth
life
That
is
grand
that
is
beautiful
This
is
a
step
every
one
has
to
take
every
one
has
to
pass
through
this
I
learned
my
first
step
in
a
few
months
When
I
woke
up
from
the
sleep
of
death
we
call
it
a
sleep
of
transition
I
was
really
awake
I
had
understanding
I
was
told
about
the
grand
things
in
spirit
but
I
never
could
have
imagined
it
as
grand
as
I
found
it
Let
us
visit
the
churches
of
the
earth
sphere
the
place
of
the
spirits
who
pass
out
with
religious
belief
and
dogma
These
gather
in
a
group
and
do
not
try
to
waken
to
the
realization
that
they
are
still
sleeping
spiritually
because
they
have
never
asked
Who
am
I
Where
did
I
come
from
Where
do
I
go
Where
is
the
real
life
They
are
self
hypnotized
by
their
belief
in
Jesus
Christ
and
in
God
sitting
on
a
throne
with
Christ
at
His
right
side
judging
the
people
good
and
bad
Some
they
think
have
to
go
to
a
burning
hell
and
some
will
go
in
glory
to
God
in
Heaven
That
is
the
belief
they
have
and
although
dead
the
majority
of
those
who
only
believe
are
still
on
earth
going
to
church
They
want
to
be
on
earth
singing
the
same
songs
and
praying
the
same
prayers
They
think
that
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
sing
and
pray
Many
do
not
know
they
have
passed
out
They
do
not
even
stop
to
think
that
their
relatives
and
friends
do
not
talk
to
them
as
they
did
formerly
We
have
a
very
hard
time
to
reach
them
Some
sing
and
pray
others
walk
alone
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
matter
at
other
times
they
become
attached
to
mortals
and
hypnotize
them
so
by
their
belief
that
the
mortals
become
obsessed
and
are
sent
to
the
asylum
for
religious
mania
It
is
a
great
pity
that
men
cannot
understand
God
When
they
have
that
understanding
they
cannot
live
for
themselves
they
will
want
to
work
for
others
and
give
every
one
of
their
happiness
I
have
still
to
see
the
depth
of
misery
to
which
the
wretched
ones
go
because
of
hate
and
selfishness
These
hate
all
humanity
That
is
the
worst
condition
They
are
so
crippled
that
you
can
hardly
believe
they
are
persons
They
have
to
be
taught
to
realize
but
how
can
they
be
reached
They
are
afraid
of
themselves
and
they
have
to
remain
in
that
condition
until
they
pray
in
all
earnestness
to
be
freed
I
have
learned
this
in
the
few
months
I
have
been
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
I
have
a
very
nice
home
in
the
spirit
world
I
have
my
relatives
and
friends
but
everything
is
very
different
here
from
there
I
have
to
help
many
of
my
friends
because
even
though
some
passed
out
long
before
I
they
are
still
in
darkness
regarding
an
understanding
of
the
real
life
The
teaching
of
children
should
be
very
different
from
what
it
is
Children
should
be
taught
about
God
in
Nature
taught
that
God
is
Love
If
they
were
properly
taught
you
would
not
have
any
crime
They
would
love
Nature
they
would
love
animals
they
would
love
humanity
at
large
But
they
are
taught
not
to
worship
Nature
How
could
you
worship
God
more
beautifully
than
to
worship
Him
through
His
manifestation
I
am
glad
to
be
with
you
tonight
and
I
want
you
all
to
go
on
with
your
work
If
you
could
only
see
every
evening
when
you
have
your
meeting
how
many
crippled
and
unfortunate
spirits
listen
and
try
to
get
help
so
they
can
pass
into
the
life
beyond
Humanity
should
rouse
itself
and
not
send
so
many
ignorant
spirits
to
the
other
side
because
these
only
stay
near
the
earth
and
do
harm
to
those
who
are
here
on
earth
Humanity
will
have
a
difficult
time
for
a
little
while
because
of
crime
and
selfishness
All
that
people
live
for
now
is
money
and
self
They
will
have
to
change
their
viewpoint
some
time
Then
peace
will
go
over
the
earth
Now
it
is
war
war
with
everybody
but
when
peace
and
harmony
prevail
you
will
find
a
glorious
condition
I
say
Hallelujah
Let
that
time
come
as
quickly
as
possible
Just
now
it
is
fighting
and
laws
Unless
this
is
changed
people
will
rise
because
they
want
freedom
but
God
speed
the
day
when
the
peace
spirit
will
come
over
all
Frank
is
a
good
fellow
to
be
with
and
he
is
not
afraid
to
make
inquiries
At
times
I
feel
like
saying
No
I
can
t
do
that
but
he
says
there
is
nothing
which
can
harm
you
if
you
are
not
afraid
Fear
is
what
we
must
avoid
we
must
develop
power
When
you
develop
fear
you
create
conditions
of
fear
around
you
You
should
develop
within
yourself
the
power
of
God
the
power
to
conquer
the
power
of
Love
Then
you
will
conquer
no
matter
what
comes
I
wish
you
could
all
understand
God
not
as
a
person
but
as
the
Life
of
the
whole
Universe
and
realize
that
there
is
no
life
without
God
He
is
the
Divine
in
everything
but
we
are
clothed
with
selfishness
jealousy
and
ignorance
If
you
are
troubled
by
obsession
say
to
yourself
I
am
master
over
my
own
body
and
I
shall
be
Repeat
it
over
and
over
again
and
you
will
find
that
you
have
power
Do
not
send
out
thoughts
of
evil
because
they
only
hinder
your
own
self
They
create
more
thoughts
of
anger
and
you
will
not
have
gained
anything
Develop
within
yourself
power
and
strength
to
conquer
Say
to
yourself
over
and
over
again
I
am
master
and
nobody
else
can
interfere
When
you
do
that
you
will
be
free
Do
not
think
of
the
other
one
obsessing
spirit
who
is
trying
to
bother
you
Send
out
a
kind
thought
to
him
Doctor
I
want
to
thank
you
and
your
wife
for
that
nice
little
party
funeral
I
had
that
is
what
I
call
it
It
was
a
nice
little
party
at
the
time
I
passed
to
the
spirit
world
I
do
not
think
there
was
one
in
that
little
church
who
thought
it
was
a
funeral
It
was
a
party
I
was
with
them
during
the
service
I
do
not
think
any
one
thought
of
the
coffin
I
thank
you
all
for
letting
the
service
be
held
in
that
fine
little
church
and
also
for
suggesting
that
they
all
wear
white
That
was
glory
and
I
felt
like
shouting
Hallelujah
I
wish
all
funerals
could
be
like
that
Sadness
and
sorrow
bring
to
the
spirits
sadness
and
sorrow
and
gloom
They
cannot
get
out
of
that
gloom
for
years
Now
I
must
go
Another
old
friend
a
physician
and
metaphysician
who
had
been
a
lecturer
among
the
Spiritualists
during
his
earth
life

us
occasionally
EXPERIENCE
OCTOBER
Spirit
DR
ADAMS
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
am
heart
and
soul
in
this
work
I
was
in
this
work
when
in
life
not
so
much
doing
the
obsession
work
as
does
Doctor
but
I
was
in
the
work
of
spreading
the
truth
that
there
is
a
life
after
this
It
is
a
real
life
not
an
imaginary
one
it
is
a
life
of
understanding
not
a
life
of
belief
If
you
only
believe
you
will
be
in
darkness
with
a
closed
door
because
you
have
only
belief
not
knowledge
of
the
other
world
The
Bible
teaches
so
much
and
if
people
would
only
understand
it
as
it
was
really
meant
not
take
it
literally
or
historically
it
would
be
so
much
better
You
must
understand
that
at
the
time
the
Bible
was
written
the
people
were
not
as
enlightened
as
they
are
today
and
there
was
so
much
selfishness
When
the
first
church
was
formed
it
was
the
church
of
the
understanding
of
life
and
the
teaching
was
to
live
for
high
thoughts
and
to
sacrifice
self
for
others
When
you
study
and
study
deeply
earth
conditions
have
no
existence
for
you
Religion
is
often
used
as
a
whip
for
ignorant
people
The
leaders
say
We
want
these
people
to
obey
us
we
want
them
to
do
as
we
tell
them
to
do
we
want
them
to
be
slaves
Look
back
in
history
and
you
will
find
that
people
were
easygoing
very
lazy
did
not
care
they
did
not
care
to
do
anything
The
women
were
the
ones
who
did
the
work
they
did
the
farming
for
the
men
were
too
lazy
The
women
had
to
do
the
work
and
be
the
slaves
Then
along
came
a
shrewd
man
who
thought
We
will
make
these
men
work
and
the
leaders
got
up
a
scheme
to
scare
people
They
told
them
that
if
they
did
not
do
so
and
so
the
devil
would
get
hold
of
them
when
they
die
and
they
would
go
to
hell
and
damnation
Then
they
painted
hell
in
the
worst
condition
they
could
They
painted
it
as
a
big
oven
burning
There
were
skeletons
here
and
there
and
hot
fire
and
the
one
that
put
people
in
the
fire
was
the
devil
and
he
put
them
in
with
his
pitchfork
That
made
the
men
wake
up
That
picture
gave
them
energy
strength
and
power
They
were
afraid
afraid
they
would
get
into
that
hell
when
they
died
Humanity
tried
to
do
everything
possible
to
escape
that
hell
and
the
leaders
were
able
to
make
the
people
do
whatever
they
told
them
One
conceived
the
idea
that
he
wanted
to
be
leader
then
another
wanted
to
be
the
leader
but
how
could
both
be
leaders
in
one
circle
Then
another
conceived
the
idea
that
religion
would
be
better
if
he
had
a
little
clique
of
his
own
so
he
preached
in
his
way
and
called
it
whatever
he
pleased
Along
came
another
and
he
had
his
idea
because
he
wanted
to
be
leader
so
he
gathered
some
people
into
his
corner
and
preached
in
his
way
So
we
had
one
group
here
and
another
there
One
wanted
to
rule
the
world
but
along
came
another
sect
and
they
called
themselves
by
a
new
name
and
felt
they
wanted
to
rule
They
fought
and
had
wars
Then
followed
other
religions
and
all
had
adherents
Each
tried
to
be
a
greater
leader
than
the
other
Some
were
more
crabbed
but
all
tried
to
get
the
people
together
and
hold
them
some
by
the
picture
I
spoke
of
regarding
hell
They
could
not
get
them
together
much
in
the
beginning
unless
they
held
them
in
bondage
That
has
gone
on
for
years
and
years
but
now
there
has
come
a
new
era
and
all
will
be
at
least
partially
broken
up
There
will
be
a
different
condition
Nowadays
some
of
the
people
believe
and
some
do
not
and
some
think
they
do
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
religion
and
so
we
have
a
state
of
turmoil
They
are
all
fighting
and
fighting
Each
one
fights
to
see
if
he
cannot
get
the
best
of
others
The
idea
is
to
get
all
the
money
you
can
all
the
power
you
can
and
then
be
the
leader
People
want
to
get
all
they
can
now
as
this
is
the
time
to
make
money
and
they
say
they
will
make
it
regardless
of
the
method
They
have
become
so
selfish
in
their
money
making
that
their
true
citizenship
is
lost
Things
are
very
different
now
from
what
they
were
when
I
was
a
boy
It
will
be
very
hard
for
some
time
because
capital
wants
to
rule
and
labor
wants
to
rule
so
we
have
friction
and
trouble
The
churches
are
trying
to
make
people
go
to
church
but
if
they
continue
to
keep
people
down
there
will
in
time
be
a
war
that
will
be
terrible
because
holding
people
down
kills
the
better
nature
in
them
People
get
all
they
can
from
each
other
The
spirit
of
the
day
is
to
get
all
you
can
no
matter
how
you
get
it
When
I
lived
on
this
earth
plane
it
was
an
honor
to
do
your
work
well
and
to
be
faithful
to
your
employer
Now
if
the
employer
does
not
like
your
work
he
can
easily
get
another
man
to
take
your
place
How
can
you
expect
such
people
to
feel
right
when
they
pass
out
of
their
bodies
They
leave
their
bodies
and
take
possession
of
any
one
they
can
reach
on
the
earth
plane
and
therefore
we
have
insanity
and
all
kinds
of
suicides
They
had
war
for
four
years
and
killed
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
These
left
the
world
they
loved
filled
with
hatred
and
they
come
back
and
try
to
crush
this
world
The
time
will
come
when
conditions
will
be
very
serious
but
after
that
things
will
be
better
People
will
reach
a
better
understanding
and
will
learn
through
sorrows
and
try
to
comprehend
the
mystery
of
life
There
will
be
great
inventions
which
will
be
remarkable
At
this
time
people
are
being
crushed
but
after
a
while
there
will
be
an
awakening
It
is
said
The
mills
of
the
gods
grind
slowly
but
they
grind
exceeding
fine
and
that
is
what
the
world
is
going
through
now
The
time
will
come
when
people
will
know
that
we
are
not
dead
when
we
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
but
that
we
live
We
are
trying
to
help
and
guide
you
all
and
we
hope
to
have
more
sincerity
among
the
people
Death
will
only
be
like
a
journey
which
they
take
to
another
country
where
they
will
be
with
their
loved
ones
if
they
have
understanding
You
have
flying
machines
now
but
after
a
few
years
you
will
have
air
inventions
that
are
not
dreamed
of
at
this
time
This
is
only
the
beginning
You
will
use
more
electricity
and
atmospheric
conditions
will
be
used
as
power
You
will
get
power
from
the
sun
which
will
be
of
great
benefit
to
humanity
then
the
capitalists
cannot
buy
things
as
they
do
now
They
crush
the
poor
people
now
because
they
can
buy
everything
and
the
others
cannot
have
it
They
say
God
did
not
give
it
to
you
He
gave
it
to
me
Machinery
will
run
by
that
power
Any
one
with
a
little
instruction
will
be
able
to
use
it
and
can
take
all
the
power
he
wants
from
the
atmosphere
Selfishness
will
then
be
done
away
with
and
people
will
learn
to
live
and
love
as
Christ
taught
them
They
will
not
live
a
life
of
belief
as
they
have
during
the
past
centuries
In
the
future
people
will
know
that
if
they
do
not
do
right
they
will
suffer
for
it
They
have
already
taken
away
most
of
the
pictures
of
burning
hell
and
therefore
the
churches
no
longer
have
the
control
of
the
people
they
had
in
the
past
When
ministers
teach
the
truth
regarding
the
life
after
this
they
will
have
their
churches
full
People
will
then
go
to
church
to
worship
and
will
not
only
believe
We
all
make
mistakes
and
we
should
learn
through
those
mistakes
God
wants
us
to
be
wise
and
understand
Him
It
is
not
that
God
made
a
mistake
and
did
not
know
what
He
was
doing
He
has
given
you
power
you
are
a
part
of
Him
and
after
you
learn
to
understand
God
in
all
His
wonders
you
will
be
in
the
happy
state
that
we
call
Bliss
and
that
is
Heaven
You
have
to
search
for
that
understanding
People
should
gather
together
and
unite
and
be
in
harmony
Always
selfishness
and
jealousy
creep
in
Let
us
try
to
conquer
them
and
put
them
away
and
have
love
in
our
hearts
If
only
people
would
understand
what
love
means
They
talk
it
with
their
lips
but
they
never
practice
it
I
had
a
very
hard
time
of
it
when
I
was
on
earth
because
I
believed
in
a
life
after
this
and
preached
it
They
called
me
crazy
they
said
I
would
go
to
hell
They
said
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
spirit
world
when
we
die
we
go
to
the
grave
and
stay
there
until
the
last
day
Then
we
shall
be
awakened
and
God
will
sit
on
His
throne
and
call
the
sinners
on
one
side
and
the
good
on
another
One
lot
will
go
to
hell
and
damnation
and
the
others
will
be
in
Heaven
and
glory
Isn
t
that
terrible
They
say
God
made
them
all
some
to
be
condemned
and
others
to
go
to
glory
Imagine
some
going
to
Heaven
and
seeing
the
others
lie
in
hell
and
burn
I
had
many
struggles
and
troubles
in
life
Of
course
I
was
a
physician
but
I
also
practiced
magnetism
and
I
taught
the
truth
of
the
life
hereafter
because
I
felt
it
was
my
duty
I
did
all
I
could
to
build
up
the
church
of
Spiritualism
and
I
worked
very
hard
I
wanted
to
preach
the
philosophy
of
spirit
return
not
phenomena
Do
all
you
can
to
open
the
door
to
the
unseen
but
always
with
understanding
of
the
governing
laws
The
average
Spiritualists
of
today
have
not
even
studied
the
philosophy
of
life
and
do
not
know
the
laws
that
govern
between
this
world
and
the
next
Spiritualism
is
the
Science
of
the
Bible
The
Bible
says
The
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
giveth
life
If
you
understand
the
Bible
it
becomes
a
grand
book
Many
go
blindly
to
church
only
believing
and
have
no
knowledge
or
understanding
I
shall
be
glad
when
all
phenomena
will
be
buried
and
philosophy
will
take
its
place
and
preachers
will
preach
the
true
gospel
of
God
not
of
the
Savior
but
God
the
Divine
the
Life
in
each
of
us
We
must
understand
God
better
and
learn
to
know
Him
as
we
have
the
power
to
do
Do
not
let
us
condemn
anything
through
ignorance
selfishness
and
jealousy
These
we
should
crush
under
our
feet
and
we
should
live
up
to
the
best
of
our
Love
Wisdom
and
Understanding
of
our
Maker
Good
Night
Many
years
ago
Mrs
Wickland
had
an
intimate
friend
Mrs
Lackmund
whose
little
girl
at
the
age
of
two
and
a
half
became
an
imbecile
after
one
sudden
convulsion
The
mother
was
convinced
that
this
condition
was
caused
by
spirit
obsession
and
together
with
Mrs
Wickland
began
to
investigate
the
subject
Mrs
Lackmund
and
Mrs
Wickland
had
made
an
agreement
that
whichever
one
of
them
should
first
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
would
try
to
return
and
communicate
with
the
other
saying
as
a
test
Spirit
return
is
true
A
year
after
this
Mrs
Lackmund
died
and
two
weeks
later
during
the
night
appeared
to
Mrs
Wickland
so
life
like
that
the
latter
did
not
realize
she
was
a
spirit
Mrs
Lackmund
touched
her
friend
lightly
on
the
cheek
and
Mrs
Wickland
sat
up
exclaiming
Mrs

Shortly
after

she
appeared
to
Mrs

seance
giving
unmistakable
proof
of

repeated
her

Spirit

MRS
WICKLAND
How
few
people
understand
life
or
God
in
the
right
way
Instead
of
believing
in
God
and
using
His
name
so
much
and
calling
on
Him
to
do
what
they
should
do
themselves
they
should
realize
that
God
is
Love
and
the
Light
of
Understanding
How
can
we
live
and
not
understand
Him
in
the
right
way
If
people
would
only
understand
God
as
it
was
meant
they
should
understand
Him
they
would
not
have
so
much
selfishness
worry
or
fighting
because
people
would
have
more
love
for
each
other
and
not
think
so
much
of
self
They
would
worship
God
not
money
People
think
the
more
money
they
have
the
happier
they
will
be
They
do
not
know
what
happiness
means
they
do
not
know
what
true
happiness
is
They
think
they
will
be
happy
when
they
have
plenty
of
money
to
get
things
things
to
eat
and
things
to
drink
and
live
a
life
of
injury
to
the
body
These
are
the
things
most
thought
of
at
present
In
time
however
the
world
will
understand
God
The
churches
will
soon
waken
and
teach
the
true
gospel
of
God
teach
people
not
to
believe
but
to
understand
to
understand
His
wondrous
works
to
understand
Him
and
how
He
manifests
in
everything
Every
flower
is
a
manifestation
of
God
The
odor
of
a
beautiful
flower
is
God
and
He
sends
it
out
to
everyone
that
His
presence
may
be
felt
You
can
see
God
s
manifestation
through
the
beautiful
spirit
of
the
odor
that
shines
I
call
it
so
through
that
flower
You
do
not
need
to
touch
it
If
you
were
blind
you
would
know
there
must
be
a
flower
because
of
the
odor
for
it
permeates
the
atmosphere
Shall
you
not
worship
God
and
see
how
wonderfully
He
manifests
Himself
to
you
in
the
exquisite
odor
of
flowers
that
make
you
feel
happier
for
having
them
around
you
See
the
Master
s
work
in
one
flower
and
another
Can
you
make
them
as
they
are
Can
you
paint
them
with
their
odor
In
your
garden
you
plant
one
flower
here
and
another
flower
there
why
do
they
not
mix
Why
do
not
green
leaves
grow
among
the
petals
of
the
red
flower
The
green
leaves
take
from
the
atmosphere
what
they
need
and
the
red
flower
takes
what
it
needs
and
colors
itself
The
flowers
clothe
themselves
from
the
colors
of
the
sun
One
is
purple
one
red
another
yellow
another
blue
and
each
has
its
place
in
the
beautiful
Nature
of
God
All
is
perfect
in
God
s
Nature
When
you
go
from
the
kingdom
of
flowers
and
vegetables
to
the
animals
you
will
find
something
that
you
do
not
often
find
in
men
and
women
faithful
love
Men
and
women
should
be
the
crown
of
God
s
creation
but
they
are
bound
by
doubt
and
creed
Many
think
themselves
holy
but
the
holiness
is
only
superficial
They
make
no
effort
to
be
honest
in
their
every
day
life
They
go
to
church
on
Sunday
pray
to
God
and
tell
Him
how
good
they
are
then
condemn
another
man
who
does
not
go
to
church
at
all
but
who
tries
sincerely
to
live
the
right
kind
of
life
as
best
he
knows
how
Probably
the
latter
is
nearer
God
in
his
way
than
the
one
who
worships
outwardly
and
does
not
live
a
sincere
life
Earthbound
spirits
who
torment
mortals
by
obsessing
them
are
man
made
devils
Selfishness
has
made
them
what
they
are
They
go
out
of
the
physical
in
ignorance
of
the
real
life
full
of
hatred
because
they
were
crushed
in
one
way
or
another
They
have
hatred
for
all
mankind
and
the
first
persons
they
can
attach
themselves
to
they
try
to
harm
and
there
you
have
obsession
You
must
all
be
on
your
guard
you
must
every
one
of
you
try
to
fight
obsession
Humanity
is
fighting
sickness
but
does
not
fight
the
actual
cause
of
insanity
Insanity
is
nothing
but
obsession
by
spirits
who
are
sent
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
without
understanding
the
truth
of
God
Christ
taught
us
to
love
God
above
all
things
and
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
People
do
not
love
their
neighbors
as
they
should
Teach
children
the
right
way
of
living
teach
them
the
right
understanding
of
God
and
of
the
teachings
of
Christ
Teach
them
to
live
according
to
high
principles
not
to
worship
Christ
as
a
person
but
as
the
True
Understanding
and
the
Light
of
Life
Then
you
will
not
send
earthbound
spirits
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
to
obsess
sensitives
who
have
to
be
sent
to
the
asylums
People
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
insane
They
are
sent
to
the
asylum
but
that
is
all
They
are
given
morphine
closed
up
in
a
room
and
left
there
This
is
done
only
to
protect
humanity
so
that
the
insane
will
not
harm
themselves
or
others
Instead
of
that
they
should
be
taught
the
Golden
Rule
and
be
given
an
opportunity
to
develop
higher
ideals
This

Good
Night
In
the
first
years
of
Mrs
Wickland
s

work
a
friend
Mrs
Case
was
deeply
interested

MRS
CASE
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
You
do
not
know
me
personally
but
I
feel
that
I
am
one
of
you
I
knew
Mrs
Wickland
before
she
was
married
and
as
Miss
Anna
Anderson
she
first
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
spirit
return
I
had
investigated
the
subject
slightly
and
had
read
one
of
Dr
Hartmann
s
books
as
well
as
some
theosophical
writings
I
was
interested
in
various
studies
but
not
set
in
any
One
evening
in
during
a
circle
which
I
attended
in
Minneapolis
Miss
Anderson
became
entranced
by
the
spirit
of
my
daughter
Alice
My
daughter
Alice
and
son
Willie
and
my
husband
had
all
died
in
one
month
Alice
came
over
to
me
and
throwing
herself
in
my
arms
said
Oh
Mamma
Oh
Mamma
I
am
so
glad
that
I
can
come
to
you
This
is
Alice
I
was
greatly
astonished
but
very
delighted
and
after
we
had
talked
with
each
other
for
a
little
while
Alice
said
Mamma
Willie
is
also
here
and
he
wants
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
Then
my
son
spoke
to
me
This
surprising
experience
converted
me
and
from
that
time
I
was
eager
to
know
more
regarding
the
truth
My
daughter
Mrs
Z
and
I
often
had
little
seances
in
my
home
with
Miss
Anderson
and
had
many
delightful
visits
with
our
spirit
friends
my
mother
an
aunt
and
several
others
I
was
anxious
that
Miss
Anderson
should
bring
her
work
out
to
the
world
but
she
was
very
modest
regarding
her
mediumship
I
wanted
people
to
know
this
great
truth
so
I
went
to
Stillwater
Minnesota
and
rented
an
opera
house
intending
to
lecture
on
the
subject
of
spirit
return
and
then
have
Miss
Anderson
give
demonstrations
We
advertised
widely
and
many
people
were
present
at
the
meeting
I
had
my
lecture
prepared
but
at
the
last
moment
lost
my
courage
and
could
not
face
the
audience
We
could
not
have
the
meeting
a
failure
so
I
insisted
that
Miss
Anderson
go
into
a
trance
and
let
the
Russians
spirits
give
their
drama
She
consented
and
the
play
was
well
given
Then
Pretty
Girl
guide
came
and
the
evening
was
quite
a
success
This
was
how
Miss
Anderson
now
Mrs
Wickland
was
first
brought
before
the
public
When
I
became
very
sick
Miss
Anderson
was
with
me
a
great
deal
Through
her
I
spoke
often
to
my
spirit
friends
and
asked
them
when
I
would
go
to
my
home
in
the
spirit
world
See
Chap
Page
I
was
told
that
I
could
not
live
much
longer
but
that
it
would
be
some
time
before
I
passed
to
the
other
side
I
was
taken
sick
before
Thanksgiving
and
on
the
of
February
I
left
my
earthly
body
for
my
spirit
body
I
went
to
sleep
about
o
clock
Saturday
night
and
passed
out
Monday
at
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
At
the
time
my
daughter
sat
watching
me
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
in
the
room
I
felt
and
knew
I
was
going
and
my
daughter
Carrie
saw
my
soul
leaving
my
body
My
spirit
children
Alice
and
Willie
came
to
my
bedside
and
my
daughter
saw
them
take
me
away
When
there
is
understanding
there
is
no
death
You
only
go
to
sleep
in
your
earthly
body
and
wake
up
in
your
spirit
body
with
your
friends
about
you
It
is
a
very
pleasant
sensation
I
was
very
happy
to
think
I
had
had
such
a
peaceful
transition
I
merely
went
to
sleep
and
woke
up
in
the
spirit
world
with
my
relatives
and
friends
around
me
But
my
husband
was
not
there
When
I
asked
Why
is
my
husband
not
here
with
the
rest
I
was
told
that
he
had
been
drawn
back
to
earth
life
where
the
children
and
I
were
His
home
was
his
attraction
We
had
not
been
able
to
see
him
there
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
speak
through
a
medium
so
he
had
remained
in
a
stupor
I
went
with
my
spirit
relatives
to
find
my
husband
and
when
we
woke
him
we
were
both
very
happy
We
went
back
to
my
daughter
Carrie
to
tell
her
that
we
were
reunited
and
she
saw
us
clairvoyantly
and
was
very
pleased
After
that
I
often
came
back
and
talked
to
my
children
through
Miss
Anderson
until
she
married
and
left
Minneapolis
for
Chicago
but
I
have
retained
my
interest
in
Mrs
Wickland
and
am
one
of
the
Mercy
Band
Mrs
Wickland
s
work
has
grown
very
much
she
has
developed
and
has
had
a
great
many
experiences
She
is
doing
a
noble
work
for
humanity
This
work
has
helped
many
in
earth
life
but
many
many
more
on
the
other
side
Every
one
who
has
been
converted
goes
into
the
Mercy
Band
as
a
helper
and
helps
here
as
well
as
on
the
other
side
If
only
there
were
more
on
earth
who
would
carry
on
the
work
of
obsession
Humanity
wants
to
have
more
knowledge
and
is
looking
for
the
truth
Later
on
instruments
will
be
invented
through
which
spirits
can
speak
Spirit
philosophy
will
come
to
the
front

helping
to
bring
the
truth
before
humanity
Those
who
have
passed
out
as
children
continue
their
development
in

world
and
often
acquire

experience
by
contacting

as

PRETTY
GIRL
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
I
was
five
years
old
when
I
passed
out
of
earth
life
and
had
been
eight
years
in
the
spirit
world
when
I
was
appointed
as
a
controlling
spirit
to
protect
Mrs
Wickland
through
life
against
mischievous
spirits
A
guide
is
a
teacher
and
I
am
a
guide
now
but
then
I
was
only
a
control
At
that
time
Mrs
Wickland
was
often
asked
to
give
help
and
advice
to
persons
who
came
to
her
in
trouble
and
she
saved
many
from
suicide
by
urging
them
to
be
more
cheerful
and
to
search
for
the
bright
side
of
life
instead
of
the
gloomy
one
I
was
sent
as
control
and
adviser
because
I
myself
had
seen
the
dark
side
of
earth
life
and
could
sympathize
more
fully
with
persons
who
were
in
trouble
than
could
one
who
had
never
known
sorrow
I
was
born
in
London
in
the
Whitechapel
district
on
the
of
August
My
parents
were
drunkards
and
many
times
when
they
came
home
I
had
to
hide
otherwise
I
would
have
had
a
whipping
My
father
and
mother
swore
at
me
and
called
me
all
kinds
of
names
and
most
of
the
time
I
was
playing
on
the
streets
I
had
light
curly
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
passers
by
used
to
pat
me
on
the
head
and
say
Pretty
little
girl
pretty
girl
Those
are
the
only
kind
words
I
remember
from
my
earth
life
and
I
heard
Pretty
Girl
so
often
I
thought
that
was
my
name
A
neighbor
lady
was
the
only
person
who
ever
helped
me
she
was
very
kind
and
took
care
of
me
When
I
was
five
years
old
I
died
Eight
years
later
in
I
came
to
be
Mrs
Wickland
s
control
because
I
needed
further
earth
experience
and
because
a
youthful
spirit
brings
to
a
psychic
a
feeling
of
youth
and
strength
It
is
often
asked
why
mediums
usually
have
children
or
young
people
as
guides
When
a
spirit
who
has
lived
to
an
old
age
on
earth
acts
as
guide
through
his
contact
with
matter
he
is
apt
to
sense
his
last
physical
condition
and
this
often
leaves
an
old
and
tired
feeling
with
the
medium
while
children
bring
a
youthful
magnetism
For
this
reason
many
mediums
have
children
as
guides
Then
also
the
children
learn
earthly
conditions
and
through
this
experience
progress
in
the
spirit
world
They
do
not
need
to
reincarnate
because
they
gain
earth
experience
through
contact
with
mortals
Advanced
spirits
say
such
as
Abraham
Lincoln
do
not
need
to
come
to
earth
for
further
experience
They
do
their
duty
in
the
spirit
world
often
helping
earthbound
spirits
and
giving
lectures
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
If
a
medium
in
earth
life
should
happen
to
be
properly
tuned
in
as
a
radio
such
a
lecture
may
be
received
and
delivered
In
such
instances
the
medium
often
thinks
the
advanced
spirit
is
his
guide
But
a
spirit
like
Lincoln
is
a
guide
to
no
one
he
does
not
need
to
return
to
control
a
medium
in
order
to
progress
If
mediums
are
in
tune
they
may
receive
and
repeat
lectures
given
in
the
spirit
world
but
they
are
only
receiving
instruments
and
are
speaking
inspirationally
The
first
time
I
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
I
thought
I
had
come
to
life
again
I
acted
as
a
girl
of
the
street
with
no
knowledge
of
anything
I
was
very
jolly
and
boisterous
and
the
people
in
the
circle
told
me
if
I
did
not
behave
myself
I
could
not
come
again
So
I
tried
to
behave
and
do
my
very
best
I
wanted
to
learn
so
that
after
a
while
I
could
be
a
teacher
helper
and
adviser
I
went
to
school
on
the
spirit
side
of
life
to
learn
the
lessons
of
earth
and
these
lessons
I
gave
many
times
to
persons
in
earth
life
When
Mrs
Wickland
first
developed
her
mediumship
she
also
studied
Theosophy
Christian
Science
and
Psychology
She
questioned
whether
during
her
trance
condition
a
spirit
was
actually
speaking
or
whether
it
was
her
own
subconscious
mind
Wishing
to
learn
the
facts
she
took
up
the
study
of
Astrology
and
had
Dr
Wickland
ask
me
what
my
birth
date
birth
place
general
appearance
last
sickness
and
date
of
death
were
Then
Mrs
Wickland
cast
my
horoscope
which
indicated
that
a
person
born
on
the
date
given
would
have
light
curly
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
happy
sunny
disposition
which
I
had
She
also
found
that
five
years
after
birth
this
person
had
Saturn
Uranus
and
Mars
in
Taurus
the
sign
that
rules
the
throat
which
indicated
death
at
that
time
from
throat
disease
I
had
died
from
diphtheria
This
proved
to
Mrs
Wickland
that
it
was
not
her
subconscious
mind
speaking
for
she
was
much
older
than
I
and
she
also
learned
that
what
I
had
said
previously
was
true
Everyone
in
earth
life
is
guided
by
a
spirit
But
sometimes
an
earthbound
spirit
steps
in
and
takes
control
and
then
there
is
obsession
or
possession
Mortals
live
in
the
slum
of
earthbound
spirits
Few
realize
what
is
on
the
other
side
How
many
try
to
learn
where
they
will
go
after
they
pass
out
The
majority
after
leaving
the
body
remain
for
some
time
just
where
they
have
been
during
earth
life
It
makes
no
difference
whether
they
are
intelligent
or
ignorant
if
they
have
no
knowledge
of
the
other
side
they
stay
just
where
they
have
passed
out
Many
are
in
a
heavy
sleep
or
in
a
coma
state
following
the
use
of
narcotics
and
will
remain
so
for
some
time
unless
some
relative
or
friend
in
the
spirit
world
finds
them
and
wakens
them
or
someone
from
either
side
sends
a
messenger
by
thought
waves
to
rouse
them
Some
have
hypnotized
themselves
into
a
coma
condition
by
a
religious
belief
that
they
will
stay
in
the
grave
until
the
Last
Day
or
by
thinking
that
death
is
the
end
There
are
many
with
various
religious
beliefs
who
do
not
know
they
are
dead
they
go
about
preaching
and
singing
because
they
have
not
found
Jesus
and
they
gather
around
the
churches
on
earth
and
continue
to
sing
and
pray
There
may
be
persons
in
the
churches
who
are
sensitives
or
of
nervous
temperament
some
of
the
spirits
take
control
of
them
and
pray
and
sing
until
those
persons
are
called
insane
and
sent
to
asylums
Other
spirits
exert
a
bad
influence
on
humanity
They
may
want
revenge
and
they
hypnotize
or
obsess
sensitive
persons
and
influence
them
to
commit
murder
or
suicide
Often
a
murderer
knows
nothing
about
the
crime
of
which
he
is
accused
for
the
deed
was
done
by
a
revengeful
spirit
What
right
have
the
wise
men
of
earth
such
as
the
judges
and
lawyers
to
condemn
that
person
and
take
his
life
The
person
who
is
executed
goes
out
of
earth
life
filled
with
hatred
and
comes
back
for
revenge
impressing
others
to
kill
or
commit
suicide
The
judges
and
lawyers
should
ascertain
whether
the
accused
person
is
actually
guilty
or
influenced
by
some
revengeful
spirit
who
has
acted
through
him
Jesus
said
He
that
is
without
sin
among
you
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
Instead
of
condemning
criminals
the
judges
the
lawyers
and
the
ministers
should
teach
them
teach
them
higher
truths
and
bring
out
their
better
nature
If
those
in
prison
knew
that
when
they
are
released
people
would
help
them
and
give
them
a
chance
they
would
be
greatly
encouraged
to
do
better
Many
call
themselves
Christians
but
will
not
help
those
in
need
as
Christ
would
have
done
When
an
employer
learns
that
a
man
has
been
in
prison
he
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
him
The
man
cannot
get
work
Where
can
he
go
Nowhere
but
back
to
crime
When
we
go
to
the
lowest
sphere
to
help
we
try
to
reach
the
better
nature
of
men
and
women
We
give
them
object
lessons
and
when
their
love
and
sympathy
are
won
they
become
true
friends
no
matter
how
low
they
have
been
When
those
who
have
lived
only
for
self
and
for
enjoyment
reach
the
spirit
side
of
life
they
have
to
serve
others
Serving
is
progression
in
the
spirit
world
Because
of
their
simplicity
of
life
and
religion
and
their
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
Nature
the
American
Indians
are
seldom
bound
in
spirit
after
leaving
the
earth
plane
and
are
often
sent
as

EXPERIENCE
MARCH
Spirit
SILVER
STAR
Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
Mediums
so
often
have
Indians
as
controls
guides
and
helpers
because
Indians
have
no
beliefs
or
dogmas
to
overcome
when
they
pass
to
the
spirit
world
From
early
infancy
they
are
taught
regarding
The
Great
Spirit
and
The
Happy
Hunting
Ground
They
believe
in
The
Great
Spirit
of
all
Things
and
the
Medicine
Man
has
taught
them
how
to
control
Nature
We
Indians
are
sent
to
earth
to
guard
mortals
because
we
know
the
law
of
protection
and
so
we
are
often
the
doorkeepers
to
protect
mediums
from
earthbound
spirits
The
pale
faces
die
from
all
kinds
of
diseases
but
the
Indians
do
not
There
is
little
sickness
among
the
Indians
they
live
in
Nature
and
they
die
a
natural
death
So
when
they
come
back
to
control
they
bring
an
influence
of
strength
and
health
Indian
spirits
seldom
obsess
people
they
do
not
make
people
crazy
because
they
know
the
laws
governing
the
control
of
a
mortal
I
am
a
Chippewa
Indian
and
was
born
near
Shell
Lake
in
on
an
Indian
Reservation
in
Northern
Wisconsin
I
was
four
and
a
half
years
old
when
I
was
hurt
on
the
head
by
a
fall
and
passed
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
when
Mrs
Wickland
cast
a
horoscope
for
me
she
found
that
death
resulting
from
an
injury
was
shown
I
came
to
Mrs
Wickland
in
at
Eau
Claire
Wisconsin
I
am
the
Doorkeeper
When
I
first
controlled
Mrs
Wickland
I
could
only
talk
the
Chippewa
language
and
what
English
I
know
I
have
learned
while
being
in
control
of
Mrs
Wickland
Different
persons
in
the
circles
have
taught
me
English
Some
people
think
Indians
do
not
know
anything
because
they
have
not
had
much
schooling
but
they
have
true
love
for
The
Great
Spirit
and
a
true
love
for
helping
others
Of
course
there
are
evil
Indians
as
well
as
good
Indians
but
the
bad
ones
are
only
those
who
have
no
understanding
of
The
Great
Spirit
and
most
of
their
bad
habits
are
acquired
from
the
pale
faces
Before
the
pale
faces
came
to
America
there
was
no
fear
among
the
Indians
The
Indians
of
different
tribes
fought
with
each
other
but
were
fearless
Then
the
pale
faces
came
and
hunted
them
down
like
animals
Fear
and
anger
crept
into
the
hearts
of
the
Indians
and
then
came
trouble
and
war
Many
pale
faces
wanted
Indian
land
and
some
stole
the
land
from
the
Indians
and
then
the
Indians
got
angry
and
fought
They
thought
all
the
pale
faces
were
the
same
and
then
came
trouble
If
the
pale
faces
had
treated
the
Indians
kindly
in
the
beginning
they
would
never
have
had
wars
with
them
Treat
an
Indian
with
kindness
and
he
will
do
much
for
you
The
Medicine
Men
are
those
who
study
Nature
s
forces
and
have
power
over
them
and
the
Indians
are
often
able
to
make
rain
When
they
pray
they
use
the
higher
forces
of
life
They
do
not
do
what
the
pale
faces
often
do
pray
with
the
mouth
and
only
talk
They
say
little
but
dance
around
in
a
big
circle
and
concentrate
Sometimes
they
have
a
Snake
Dance
They
have
learned
to
charm
snakes
so
they
will
not
bite
because
the
Indians
have
no
fear
If
the
pale
faces
would
overcome
fear
they
could
do
wonderful
things
In
olden
times
the
pale
faces
had
no
fear
but
they
were
scared
by
the
stories
of
hell
and
the
devil
and
this
fear
grew
so
that
the
people
lost
control
of
Nature
s
finer
forces
There
are
no
religions
in
the
spirit
world
all
are
brothers
and
sisters
in
Truth
All
are
alike
in
the
Higher
Life
after
they
have
an
understanding
of
The
Great
Spirit
Another
one
of
Mrs
Wickland
s
guiding
spirits
is
Movilia
an
Esquimo
who
brings
strength
and
power
to
the
circle
He
lived
in
Greenland
and
was
a
traveling
lecturer
doctor
and
entertainer
a
Medicine
Man
of
high
order
with
a
profound
knowledge
of
Nature
He
journeyed
among
his
people
as
an
organizer
and
a
philosopher
accompanied
by
his
wife
a
poetess
and
singer
and
his
children
who
danced
symbolical
dances
Some
of
the
Esquimo
songs
when
given
through
Mrs
Wickland
by
Movilia
and
his
wife
have
been
recognized
by
an
Alaskan
traveler
as
being
a
part
of
certain
Esquimo
ceremonies
These
Esquimos
do
not
speak
English
but
one
evening
Movilia
brought
another
Esquimo
who
acted
as
interpreter
for
him
and
told
us
something
of
the
Esquimo
religion

Psychic
MRS
WICKLAND
My
name
is
Esovilia
Chevilia
Esquimo
and
the
ones
for
whom
I
talk
are
Movilia
and
his
wife
We
believe
in
the
Great
Spirit
of
Love
Wisdom
and
Knowledge
and
that
we
are
a
part
of
that
Great
Spirit
and
that
when
we
pray
from
our
hearts
we
shall
receive
what
we
ask
for
The
Medicine
Man
is
the
one
who
knows
the
Secret
of
the
Universe
the
Secret
of
Love
the
Secret
of
Knowledge
and
the
Secret
of
Wisdom
and
Truth
It
is
in
that
Spirit
we
live
and
each
tries
to
do
the
best
he
knows
how
Sometimes
there
comes
a
missionary
who
thinks
we
are
not
Christians
and
that
we
do
not
live
right
and
does
not
think
we
love
God
as
they
call
The
Great
Spirit
We
love
the
Great
Spirit
of
Love
the
Great
Spirit
of
Truth
The
Great
Spirit
and
we
worship
Him
We
do
not
believe
we
know
We
know
the
truth
and
we
know
that
we
are
a
part
of
that
Divine
Spirit
that
is
within
us
and
when
we
are
in
contact
with
that
Great
Spirit
of
Truth
we
have
much
in
our
hearts
We
can
understand
His
meaning
of
Life
His
meaning
of
Love
for
His
children
here
on
earth
Some
of
the
missionaries
who
come
to
us
say
that
Christ
died
for
our
sins
Dear
friends
we
do
not
have
sins
for
Christ
to
die
for
for
God
is
Love
and
Power
He
is
Wisdom
Knowledge
and
Truth
We
are
a
part
of
that
wonderful
Being
When
we
are
a
part
of
that
wonderful
spirit
how
could
we
be
full
of
sin
We
could
not
fall
away
from
Him
because
we
are
a
part
of
Him
we
live
in
Him
and
are
a
part
of
Him
We
could
not
get
away
from
Him
because
He
is
every
where
He
is
the
whole
Universe
the
whole
Love
the
whole
Life
of
everything
How
can
anyone
think
we
could
believe
in
such
a
doctrine
that
He
the
Great
Spirit
that
knows
everything
is
everywhere
and
knows
the
past
present
and
future
could
in
all
His
power
and
greatness
let
us
go
down
and
down
and
fall
in
sin
How
could
He
The
missionary
says
we
must
be
born
in
His
image
and
must
believe
in
Him
that
He
died
for
our
sins
and
if
we
believe
that
we
will
go
to
Heaven
when
we
die
We
pray
to
the
wonderful
Spirit
that
you
call
God
You
have
dogmas
and
dogmas
and
creeds
and
beliefs
We
put
ourselves
in
rapport
with
that
Great
Spirit
and
we
believe
in
His
power
We
try
to
get
the
power
from
the
Great
Spirit
for
healing
and
for
other
purposes
We
have
Hope
in
that
power
we
have
Wisdom
in
that
power
The
Christians
believe
and
believe
that
they
fall
in
sin
and
that
somebody
must
raise
them
up
If
you
step
outside
of
the
Law
you
know
what
will
happen
If
you
put
your
hand
in
the
fire
you
know
you
have
broken
the
Law
and
must
suffer
If
you
have
the
belief
that
you
have
fallen
in
sin
you
have
transgressed
the
Law
and
you
will
suffer
We
must
find
the
Great
Spirit
within
not
look
outside
Find
ourselves
and
we
will
find
Him
for
we
are
a
part
of
that
wonderful
Mind
that
wonderful
Power
Let
us
all
try
to
get
in
rapport
with
Him
in
His
wonderful
wonderful
glory
When
you
are
in
rapport
with
the
Great
Spirit
you
will
feel
happy
You
have
then
learned
your
lesson
and
will
go
on
your
way
and
not
overstep
the
Law
You
will
get
out
of
your
ignorance
You
travel
on
the
pathway
of
Life
if
you
walk
out
of
the
pathway
you
may
remain
as
long
as
you
wish
but
you
must
finally
get
back
on
the
road
again
What
made
you
go
from
the
pathway
You
overstepped
the
law
of
Nature
You
finally
get
so
weary
of
breaking
the
laws
of
Nature
that
you
will
ask
What
am
I
here
for
and
where
am
I
going
Then
you
will
find
you
are
a
Truth
Seeker
you
will
knock
and
the
door
will
be
opened
You
will
look
within
instead
of
as
before
without
You
have
been
living
in
the
material
with
all
its
dogmas
here
one
here
another
And
then
there
is
so
much
condemning
You
are
all
Christians
and
yet
you
condemn
and
fight
and
fight
each
other
and
you
have
so
much
turmoil
This
condition
will
continue
until
you
ask
yourself
What
is
it
all
about
Then
you
will
try
to
find
out
When
you
seek
for
things
from
your
heart
you
will
find
Ask
God
to
reveal
Himself
to
you
Ask
God
to
manifest
Himself
in
your
heart
before
you
leave
the
broad
road
of
Experience
for
the
narrow
road
of
Reason
When
you
get
on
the
narrow
road
you
will
feel
happy
and
contented
and
you
come
into
the
Glory
of
the
Infinite
There
all
is
beautiful
There
is
no
selfishness
The
narrow
road
is
only
for
Love
Kindness
Knowledge
and
Wisdom
of
God
The
Christians
look
for
God
outside
we
look
for
God
within
ourselves
Within
ourselves
we
look
for
the
Great
Spirit
We
do
not
have
so
many
creeds
and
dogmas
and
so
many
religious
speculations
We
do
not
have
to
speculate
for
we
know
One
gets
the
truth
one
way
one
another
and
so
they
go
all
divided
nothing
definite
People
must
change
for
they
have
had
enough
of
dogmas
Let
them
get
more
of
the
Wisdom
of
God
on
the
narrow
road
of
Reason
and
find
themselves
When
they
have
found
themselves
they
will
have
no
sorrow
and
no
unhappiness
because
they
will
be
happy
with
the
Love
of
God
When
they
love
God
they
will
love
others
for
they
cannot
keep
it
to
themselves
You
want
your
friends
to
love
God
with
you
You
want
them
to
see
the
glory
of
God
We
never
saw
such
a
thing
as
you
Christians
call
The
Devil
we
call
it
Selfishness
and
Ignorance
Find
yourself
now
If
you
do
not
you
will
have
to
stop
here
there
and
everywhere
When
you
have
that
beautiful
knowledge
all
is
happiness
You
must
experience
this
feeling
within
yourself
before
you
can
teach
it
to
others
This
is
the
Religion
of
the
Esquimos
I
was
a
Medicine
Man
on
earth
and
I
was
also
a
teacher
Esquimo
Movilia
was
the
one
that
came
to
me
and
wanted
me
to
say
to
you
what
he
wishes
to
say
I
have
only
repeated
what
he
told
me
to
say
We
have
no
wars
We
try
to
live
as
near
Nature
and
the
Great
Spirit
as
we
can
We
are
not
a
pretty
people
and
we
do
not
have
so
much
changing
as
you
do
in
dress
We
have
our
beauty
within
us
Prettiness
is
only
skin
deep
so
we
do
not
care
The
Christian
has
to
be
awakened
through
suffering
and
trouble
Then
you
begin
to
look
for
what
is
called
the
truth
You
think
that
Jesus
died
for
your
sins
He
could
not
and
He
did
not
The
sins
that
are
committed
now
are
many
more
than
when
He
was
on
earth
Many
things
have
been
discovered
that
were
not
known
then
so
how
could
he
die
for
something
that
was
not
known
I
think
that
is
very
strange
God
made
us
and
He
knew
When
you
find
God
within
yourself
you
cannot
do
wrong
You
sing
and
are
happy
and
happiness
is
something
we
all
want
We
had
one
man
come
to
us
and
preach
He
took
away
with
him
one
of
the
best
men
we
had
and
tried
to
bring
him
up
with
your
Christians
He
returned
to
us
a
ruined
man
full
of
diseases
We
do
not
have
such
diseases
because
we
live
up
to
the
highest
laws
of
Nature
He
came
back
and
told
us
how
you
who
call
yourselves
Christians
live
We
all
felt
so
horrified
to
know
that
the
Christians
were
so
diseased
in
mind
and
body
That
is
what
the
Christians
did
for
our
fellow
Esquimo
So
I
felt
that
I
wanted
to
come
and
tell
you
of
our
religion
Let
all
in
this
little
circle
find
themselves
and
God
because
you
and
God
are
one
Here
is
a
big
light
say
a
candle
which
stands
in
the
center
Around
it
are
smaller
candles
but
they
are
all
a
part
of
the
same
material
as
the
larger
candle
You
take
the
smaller
candles
and
light
them
from
the
big
one
then
you
have
the
spark
of
Life
Can
you
then
understand
what
is
meant
by
being
a
spark
of
God
When
you
die
as
the
Christians
call
it
you
only
blow
out
the
candle
The
tallow
has
gone
back
to
the
elements
Find
God
within
you
then
you
have
Power
Strength
and
Love
and
are
learning
to
get
Wisdom
Then
you
have
learned
to
get
strength
and
conquer
material
to
conquer
sorrow
and
sickness
You
cannot
be
sick
for
you
have
the
light
of
understanding
and
the
more
understanding
you
have
the
more
strength
you
have
All
of
you
here
are
a
part
of
that
Universal
Light
and
you
must
all
have
that
light
from
the
candle
Do
not
worship
the
candle
but
worship
the
Light
of
Understanding
and
God
Do
not
let
anyone
come
in
your
way
and
make
you
think
you
cannot
reach
God
The
Christians
do
not
truly
understand
God
They
must
have
somebody
to
talk
for
them
their
Savior
as
they
call
him
They
worship
Christ
Christ
is
Truth
and
when
you
find
Truth
that
is
Christ
Worship
God
When
you
understand
how
to
worship
God
you
will
have
strength
and
power
and
success
will
be
yours
We
say
Find
God
within
your
heart
and
all
else
will
come
to
YOU
We
do
not
believe
we
know
Have
the
true
knowledge
of
God
in
your
heart
and
you
will
be
happy
Good
Night
From
the
time
Mrs
Wickland
first
developed
as
a
psychic
she
has
been
especially
under
the
protection
of
the
spirit
Dr
Root
who
has
fostered
this
obsession
work
and
urged
us
to
bring
it
before
the
public
He
has
come
often
to
speak
with
encouragement
and
to
lecture
to
invisible
as
well
as
visible
audiences
on
the
higher
philosophy

DR

PSYCHIC
MRS
WICKLAND
As
we
are
gathered
together
in
this
little
hall
I
wish
you
could
open
your
psychic
eyes
to
see
the
many
spirits
who
have
come
here
for
an
understanding
of
the
life
hereafter
There
has
never
been
real
happiness
on
earth
and
there
will
not
be
so
long
as
people
are
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
of
religion
In
all
times
there
have
been
many
different
kinds
of
religion
and
always
there
has
been
selfishness
You
now
live
in
the
Twentieth
Century
and
since
this
is
an
enlightened
age
why
should
not
people
be
more
intelligent
and
know
more
about
the
world
here
and
the
world
beyond
People
worship
the
Golden
Calf
more
than
they
worship
God
The
churches
are
falling
to
pieces
because
they
cannot
make
people
believe
as
they
used
to
in
olden
times
People
now
want
knowledge
not
belief
and
if
the
churches
would
teach
true
religion
people
would
be
better
Many
ministers
know
in
their
hearts
that
people
do
not
believe
the
old
stories
It
is
the
Golden
Calf
again
they
worship
money
and
they
stand
in
the
pulpit
and
talk
against
their
better
nature
Some
day
this
world
will
conquer
selfishness
but
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
at
present
most
of
the
people
are
insane
regarding
money
making
They
seem
not
to
be
able
to
get
money
enough
There
is
little
honor
only
money
money
There
is
little
sympathy
all
want
only
what
they
can
get
from
others
through
money
making
schemes
In
time
this
money
scheme
will
fall
to
pieces
We
should
study
the
other
side
of
life
as
well
as
this
when
we
are
on
earth
If
you
want
to
become
a
minister
doctor
lawyer
or
lecturer
you
have
to
study
to
acquire
knowledge
Why
should
we
not
study
ourselves
It
is
very
important
that
All
on
earth
should
know
where
they
are
going
after
passing
out
of
the
physical
for
they
will
then
go
to
the
right
place
and
will
not
stay
in
the
homes
they
have
left
Without
this
knowledge
many
do
not
realize
they
are
dead
and
they
remain
in
their
earthly
homes
Some
one
of
the
family
may
be
sensitive
and
may
become
obsessed
Then
the
doctors
will
declare
that
person
insane
and
send
him
to
the
asylum
for
there
is
no
pity
for
one
who
is
controlled
by
earthbound
spirits
People
should
be
taught
the
truth
then
when
they
pass
out
they
will
look
for
the
spirit
world
and
a
happy
place
beyond
instead
of
a
fictitious
Heaven
Heaven
or
hell
is
only
a
condition
within
yourself
and
Heaven
must
be
found
within
before
you
can
be
happy
in
the
spirit
world
Some
say
What
is
the
spirit
world
The
spirit
world
is
a
counterpart
of
this
with
only
one
exception
here
you
are
thrown
together
with
every
sort
of
person
while
there
you
cannot
go
anywhere
unless
you
have
understanding
of
where
you
are
going
The
spirit
side
of
life
is
like
a
school
you
progress
by
degrees
There
is
no
belief
You
learn
where
you
belong
and
where
you
are
going
It
takes
time
to
understand
but
there
is
plenty
of
time
in
eternity
to
study
and
learn
The
time
is
not
far
distant
when
people
will
open
their
eyes
and
see
and
the
churches
will
have
circles
and
try
to
understand
life
This
is
Dr
Root
I
wish
you
all
happiness
and
success
in
your
work

MRS
WICKLAND
I
am
glad
I
can
be
with
you
tonight
to
tell
you
of
the
beautiful
conditions
we
have
on
the
spirit
side
The
greater
number
think
that
when
death
comes
they
will
go
to
a
certain
place
and
stay
there
until
the
last
of
this
earth
The
Last
Day
is
every
day
that
you
throw
away
selfishness
and
ignorance
That
is
Death
Life
is
Love
and
Wisdom
Let
us
die
daily
to
our
ignorance
and
selfishness
Let
us
awaken
to
the
truth
and
an
understanding
of
God
who
has
given
us
that
truth
and
who
has
sent
forth
His
messengers
to
tell
us
what
life
is
on
the
other
side
It
is
a
life
which
is
more
spiritual
more
congenial
and
more
beautiful
in
every
respect
than
the
one
on
earth
When
you
have
Truth
in
your
heart
you
are
happy
When
you
have
selfishness
and
ignorance
in
your
heart
you
are
sorrowful
Sorrow
will
follow
you
until
you
say
Not
my
will
but
Thine
When
others
come
in
your
way
and
try
to
keep
you
down
rise
and
say
No
I
will
be
firm
and
I
will
conquer
and
then
you
can
create
happiness
and
contentment
in
your
soul
and
you
will
have
happiness
around
you
When
you
think
only
of
selfishness
and
creeds
you
have
sadness
and
sorrow
and
you
will
have
to
burn
these
out
by
suffering
and
say
Not
my
will
any
longer
but
Thy
will
Let
us
pray
to
God
because
He
is
All
in
All
He
is
with
you
all
We
could
not
live
one
minute
without
that
wonderful
power
Do
not
let
us
pray
to
anyone
else
because
God
is
within
ourselves
You
do
not
need
to
go
anywhere
except
your
own
heart
to
pray
to
Him
Have
communion
with
God
in
your
heart
and
you
do
not
need
to
take
communion
outside
When
you
have
learned
the
truth
then
communion
is
within
you
You
do
not
need
to
be
reminded
to
take
communion
with
God
because
you
know
He
is
there
to
help
you
You
have
opened
your
heart
to
God
and
He
has
heard
you
and
you
can
then
commune
with
Him
Communion
is
not
understood
as
it
should
be
You
take
communion
It
is
only
a
reminder
that
you
should
be
united
with
God
When
you
have
learned
and
have
progressed
higher
and
higher
you
do
not
need
a
physical
reminder
because
you
understand
When
you
have
communion
with
God
you
do
not
need
bread
and
wine
You
cannot
go
anywhere
without
God
God
is
in
the
air
He
is
everywhere
You
cannot
walk
on
the
earth
without
stepping
on
His
creation
and
you
should
try
to
understand
His
work
There
has
been
so
much
theorizing
One
has
one
theory
someone
else
another
One
goes
into
this
corner
another
into
that
corner
and
one
says
this
is
the
proper
way
and
the
other
says
that
is
the
proper
way
one
has
one
creed
and
one
has
another
They
go
around
in
a
little
circle
and
forget
they
are
in
the
midst
of
life
of
God
Himself
When
you
do
a
kind
act
to
another
you
do
it
unto
God
because
he
is
one
part
of
God
and
you
another
We
only
serve
God
when
we
serve
others
Live
to
serve
and
do
all
you
can
for
others
then
you
will
progress
in
understanding
To
go
to
church
to
serve
God
is
only
to
remind
you
of
what
you
should
actually
do
Act
and
do
good
to
those
who
are
in
trouble
Why
should
you
go
to
any
place
to
worship
Enter
into
thy
closet
and
pray
to
thy
Father
which
is
in
secret
Pray
earnestly
and
your
prayers
will
be
heard
Do
not
pray
idly
but
pray
earnestly
Live
so
that
people
will
know
you
have
done
your
duty
in
life
On
the
spirit
side
we
find
it
is
difficult
to
open
the
spiritual
eyes
of
many
They
are
all
so
blinded
by
creeds
and
dogmas
that
we
have
to
do
all
within
our
power
to
help
them
understand
that
God
did
not
make
dogmas
and
creeds
but
that
God
made
the
Universe
and
the
people
in
it
should
worship
Him
alone
without
any
creed
or
dogma
When
we
understand
and
realize
love
not
what
people
call
love
here
but
the
love
which
springs
out
everywhere
then
love
is
like
the
sun
When
there
is
love
in
your
heart
you
are
like
a
sun
to
others
You
have
found
God
in
your
heart
and
this
shines
forth
just
as
the
sun
shines
on
all
Those
who
have
only
creed
dogma
and
selfishness
and
are
ignorant
feel
gloomy
they
have
a
fear
of
God
a
fear
of
everything
around
them
They
have
not
opened
their
souls
eyes
to
ask
for
the
light
for
understanding
of
God
These
come
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
in
darkness
and
gather
together
one
group
here
another
there
all
in
deep
gloom
They
pray
and
sing
and
moan
from
morning
until
night
year
after
year
It
is
very
difficult
to
make
them
understand
that
they
have
passed
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
very
hard
for
them
to
wake
up
and
see
the
mistake
they
made
in
accepting
dogmas
and
creeds
They
have
clothed
themselves
with
gloom
and
have
shut
out
the
light
that
should
have
been
shining
throughout
their
lives
If
you
love
God
in
the
sense
I
have
spoken
of
then
you
will
be
happy

Another
extract
is

MRS
WICKLAND
Let
us
concentrate
for
happiness
and
contentment
for
the
betterment
of
the
world
Let
us
never
look
backward
but
forward
Let
us
all
try
to
do
the
best
we
can
and
help
others
If
little
groups
such
as
this
one
would
concentrate
in
an
effort
to
cheer
the
world
the
world
would
be
better
This
little
light
of
concentration
does
not
seem
much
but
it
will
do
much
good
for
the
ones
in
darkness
and
those
in
trouble
If
all
the
churches
would
have
concentration
circles
to
help
the
people
and
would
give
them
cheer
and
courage
and
try
to
help
them
into
a
brighter
condition
instead
of
condemning
them
and
telling
them
they
are
lost
forever
if
they
do
not
believe
a
certain
doctrine
the
world
would
be
much
happier
and
better
You
must
find
yourselves
within
before
you
can
find
yourselves
without
You
must
be
born
again
not
in
Jesus
Christ
no
you
must
realize
your
own
self
and
that
you
are
a
part
of
God
God
gave
you
light
and
understanding
Go
out
and
help
the
people
in
trouble
and
those
who
have
not
awakened
to
an
understanding
of
God
Do
not
merely
believe
in
God
but
find
Him
within
yourselves
then
you
will
not
need
belief
Belief
and
faith
are
only
the
key
If
you
have
the
key
in
your
hand
and
do
not
know
where
it
belongs
do
not
know
which
door
it
opens
if
you
have
only
faith
and
belief
and
nothing
more
you
only
hold
the
key
but
do
not
use
it
Seek
for
knowledge
until
you
can
open
the
door
of
Wisdom
and
Understanding
Most
people
have
the
key
but
they
only
hold
it
in
their
hands
and
do
not
use
it
They
say
If
I
believe
in
God
and
Jesus
Christ
I
will
be
saved
When
the
time
comes
for
them
to
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
they
merely
hold
that
key
they
have
only
belief
and
they
find
themselves
in
darkness
because
they
have
not
used
the
key
of
understanding
that
God
gave
them
with
which
to
investigate
and
find
God
within
themselves
You
do
not
need
to
go
anywhere
you
must
open
the
door
of
your
own
heart
Find
God
and
find
that
you
are
a
part
of
that
wonderful
power
When
you
open
the
door
you
have
power
and
strength
and
health
you
have
everything
and
the
strength
of
God
s
power
will
flow
in
and
you
will
do
wonderful
things
Christ
was
a
great
teacher
but
do
people
carry
out
His
teachings
They
believe
but
they
do
not
do
what
he
told
them
Each
one
is
a
part
of
God
and
when
you
do
what
you
can
for
others
you
love
God
and
worship
Him
by
so
doing
The
people
and
the
churches
should
unite
as
one
power
and
help
each
other
and
try
to
conquer
selfishness
Spread
the
truth
find
God
within
yourself
and
open
your
heart
to
Him
through
understanding
You
have
power
so
far
as
your
mind
has
developed
If
you
try
to
develop
for
more
power
you
will
have
it
Widen
out
and
try
to
know
God
s
wonderful
mystery
in
the
world
Let
us
find
God
in
Nature
everywhere
Look
at
a
snowflake
it
is
wonderful
It
has
many
beautiful
designs
Who
made
it
It
is
so
natural
that
people
do
not
realize
its
beauty
They
say
It
is
just
snow
When
individuals
step
out
of
the
physical
the
worst
hindrance
they
have
is
desire
which
must
be
overcome
Creeds
and
dogmas
hold
them
down
they
are
not
free
They
are
as
Jesus
said
bond
servants
and
will
be
held
down
They
think
when
they
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
they
will
go
to
Heaven
Stop
to
think
where
is
Heaven
Christ
said
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
is
within
you
if
God
dwells
there
The
majority
believe
that
what
you
call
death
is
a
long
sleep
and
many
who
have
not
learned
the
lesson
of
life
go
to
sleep
Some
will
sleep
for
years
because
they
are
self
hypnotized
They
think
I
am
dying
and
I
will
go
to
the
grave
and
stay
there
until
the
Last
Day
and
then
will
be
awakened
Others
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
believing
in
certain
creeds
and
dogmas
They
go
to
certain
places
in
the
earth
sphere
where
they
sing
and
pray
and
do
not
progress
any
further
They
go
over
and
over
the
same
things
It
is
only
mouth
prayers
they
offer
Sometimes
they
remain
in
that
sphere
for
years
Sometimes
they
go
about
in
the
earth
sphere
and
try
to
convert
people
They
attach
themselves
to
some
mortal
and
that
mortal
will
be
called
insane
on
religion
What
is
done
then
The
victims
are
sent
to
the
insane
asylum
and
left
there
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
They
will
not
be
free
from
the
obsessing
spirits
until
the
body
dies
Then
those
spirits
often
attach
themselves
to
other
mortals
Let
us
understand
the
truth
Let
us
do
what
we
can
to
help
ourselves
and
others
to
an
understanding
of
God
Worship
Him
everywhere
Let
us
look
at
the
sky
and
see
the
beautiful
planets
and
stars
If
this
earth
disappeared
tomorrow
the
suns
and
stars
in
the
heavens
would
be
just
the
same
This
earth
would
not
be
missed
Do
you
think
God
sits
on
this
earth
and
controls
nothing
more
No
let
us
think
and
understand
and
study
Let
us
all
worship
God
in
His
whole
Universe
There
is
Life
everywhere
The
grandeur
of
the
heavens
cannot
be
described
the
wonderful
stars
in
the
heavens
the
planets
and
all
the
Universe
Look
through
the
microscope
and
you
will
find
you
are
in
another
world
You
will
see
germs
one
or
two
of
which
will
kill
a
big
body
They
are
all
under
one
power
God
Some
say
Why
did
God
make
all
these
germs
to
torment
humanity
They
must
be
in
order
to
have
you
realize
and
think
and
overcome
When
you
have
trouble
and
try
to
overcome
you
become
strong
A
child
that
is
protected
constantly
by
its
parents
and
sent
into
the
country
grows
up
in
a
fine
atmosphere
He
is
good
because
he
has
had
no
temptation
But
he
has
no
knowledge
that
he
is
good
A
boy
from
the
slums
who
has
had
trouble
will
more
readily
develop
into
a
man
who
can
conquer
than
the
one
who
has
been
protected
He
will
be
strong
and
able
to
help
others
Let
us
find
ourselves
Let
us
all
concentrate
and
try
to
help
and
give
light
to
every
one
we
find
needing
help
Worship
God
in
His
true
sense
and
not
in
a
little
narrow
belief
Let
us
add
knowledge
to
our
faith
You
are
the
bond
servants
that
Christ
speaks
of
He
was
a
wonderful
teacher
but
you
believe
in
His
blood
and
not
in
his
teachings
Who
killed
Christ
The
very
ones
that
belonged
to
the
church
They
did
not
believe
in
Him
Christ
is
an
allegory
He
is
the
Truth
Christ
is
born
within
you
when
you
have
attained
understanding
Then
you
will
see
and
know
and
realize
God
When
you
pass
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
you
will
have
knowledge
and
you
will
go
into
a
world
that
is
far
more
beautiful
than
this
You
can
then
reach
the
spirit
world
You
do
not
need
to
call
it
spirit
world
some
object
to
that
name
Every
one
is
a
spiritual
being
You
may
call
it
the
Higher
Sphere
you
may
call
it
Heaven
but
Heaven
is
not
a
place
If
you
think
you
are
going
to
Heaven
you
will
have
to
take
it
with
you
because
it
is
a
condition
When
you
have
suffering
you
are
in
hell
and
many
have
a
hard
struggle
to
get
out
of
that
hell
When
you
are
happy
you
are
in
Heaven
the
Heaven
within
yourself
You
have
trouble
and
sickness
but
everything
is
to
help
you
learn
to
find
yourself
When
you
have
found
yourself
within
yourself
you
can
conquer
all
conditions
from
without
You
say
I
am
very
sick
You
attract
those
forces
unto
you
and
after
a
while
your
own
mind
has
created
your
condition
You
are
a
part
of
God
the
wonderful
Creator
What
you
think
you
create
You
have
power
and
you
can
use
it
for
good
or
evil
If
you
have
trouble
disease
or
suffering
and
have
not
learned
to
throw
it
off
you
hold
it
to
yourself
Then
you
become
sensitive
and
after
a
time
you
draw
influences
around
you
and
these
in
turn
throw
disease
and
bad
thoughts
on
you
and
you
are
bound
First
find
God
within
yourself
then
you
will
have
power
to
rise
Trouble
sorrow
sickness
obsession
everything
can
be
conquered
after
you
find
the
truth
Christ
is
born
in
you
and
you
can
conquer
When
you
have
found
Christ
within
yourself
you
will
still
have
struggles
Others
will
say
Do
this
or
this
and
you
will
be
wise
Some
will
say
Overcome
the
world
overcome
There
will
be
a
cross
because
there
is
a
tempter
You
have
found
yourself
but
the
tempter
speaks
to
you
Do
this
Come
with
me
and
I
will
show
you
the
world
and
happiness
Here
is
the
cross
which
shows
Christ
is
born
within
you
Jesus
the
Son
of
Man
must
be
crucified
on
the
cross
of
matter
that
Christ
enlightenment
may
live
When
you
have
reached
that
stage
you
see
everything
as
good
You
cannot
see
bad
When
you
look
back
you
see
that
what
you
thought
bad
only
taught
you
to
understand
God
Should
you
condemn
it
No
If
you
had
not
had
that
experience
you
would
not
be
where
you
are
now
You
must
teach
others
and
help
them
to
rise
with
you
If
every
one
would
do
that
the
world
would
be
happier
Let
us
send
out
thoughts
that
all
may
conquer
and
that
they
may
understand
You
should
strive
to
gain
knowledge
of
God
s
finer
forces
Find
yourself
and
you
will
find
God
Before
I
go
I
want
to
say
that
we
have
a
room
full
of
earthbound
spirits
I
often
talk
to
them
to
help
them
This
group
we
have
here
tonight
are
spirits
we
could
not
waken
because
they
could
not
see
us
A
spirit
in
ignorance
cannot
see
an
intelligent
spirit
So
we
have
to
bring
them
here
I
talk
through
this
body
and
they
hear
me
but
they
could
not
hear
me
from
the
spirit
side
of
life
because
they
had
no
understanding
Every
time
you
have
circles
here
we
have
more
spirits
present
than
we
have
mortals
When
they
see
an
earthbound
spirit
control
they
learn
their
first
lesson
and
then
we
can
take
them
to
the
spirit
side
of
life
and
help
them
find
happiness
We
are
never
idle
in
the
spirit
world
Mind
cannot
stand
still
God
s
wonderful
thoughts
go
on
Planets
do
not
stand
still
All
is
development
Mind
is
never
inactive
so
long
as
one
tries
to
develop
This
is
Dr
Root
Good
Night
For
many
years
upon
various
occasions
a
symbolical
morality
play
has
been
given
through
Mrs
Wickland
by
a
group
of
spirit
actors
They
are
twelve
in
number
eleven
actors
and
a
director
all
of
whom
were
Russian
Slavonic
when
in
earth
life
Under
the
direction
of
the
stage
manager
they
successively
assume
control
of
Mrs
Wickland
with
such
ease
and
rapidity
that
the
change
is
scarcely
noticeable
The
play
is
given
in
the
Russian
Slavonic
tongue
a
language
which
Mrs
Wickland
herself
has
never
heard
but
which
is
spoken
perfectly
through
her
by
these
actors
as
has
been
stated
by
different
persons
witnessing
the
play
who
are
familiar
with
the
language
The
costumes
worn
by
the
spirit
actors
and
unseen
by
the
average
mortal
audience
have
been
described
by
clairvoyants
as
being
authentically
Russian
Slavonic
and
very
beautiful
These
actors
with
one
of
Mrs
Wickland
s
guides
as
interpreter
have
given
the
following
account
of
The
Morality
Play
and
its
purpose
We
are
twelve
actors
controlling
this
psychic
sensitive
in
order
to
prove
spirit
return
and
spirit
control
and
that
we
can
act
as
we
acted
while
in
the
body
We
come
to
help
people
understand
that
we
are
still
living
that
we
are
not
dead
but
are
just
as
active
as
we
were
when
in
earth
life
We
give
this
play
in
the
spirit
world
for
the
earthbound
spirits
many
of
whom
do
not
realize
they
are
dead
to
their
earth
life
We
find
them
in
the
sphere
next
to
the
earth
often
in
a
semi
sleep
Preceding
the
play
we
have
music
by
excellent
musicians
this
wakens
the
earthbound
spirits
one
after
the
other
They
rise
slowly
not
realizing
where
they
are
but
the
music
brings
them
a
little
understanding
of
the
higher
life
We
then
play
our
drama
as
a
lesson
to
these
spirits
Each
character
is
symbolical
showing
that
selfish
trivial
and
debasing
attributes
must
be
overcome
before
spirits
can
progress
The
leading
lady
represents
Love
the
leading
man
her
lover
personifies
Truth
The
ruffian
typifies
Selfishness
the
elderly
maiden
lady
depicts
Frivolity
the
officer
represents
Justice
and
the
Judge
Wisdom
The
witnesses
in
the
court
trial
portray
Knowledge
Drunkenness
Misery
Sickness
Miserliness
and
Robbery
Love
the
young
maiden
cherishes
a
true
deep
affection
for
the
hero
she
dwells
in
the
same
abode
with
Frivolity
who
entertains
an
unrequited
love
sentiment
for
Selfishness
Here
is
shown
the
close
association
in
life
of
the
True
and
False
Truth
enters
and
proposes
to
Love
who
accepts
him
he
then
departs
and
is
followed
by
Selfishness
who
desires
Love
for
himself
When
his
advances
are
rejected
Frivolity
with
her
most
fascinating
coquetries
endeavors
to
charm
the
Ruffian
Selfishness
from
Love
to
herself
This
angers
him
and
he
threatens
her
with
death
then
leaves
in
a
rage
swearing
to
kill
his
rival
Truth
Love
writes
a
frantic
note
of
warning
to
her
lover
and
hastily
sends
her
servant
to
deliver
the
message
but
the
servant
arrives
too
late
for
Selfishness
has
attacked
Truth
by
the
wayside
and
fatally
wounded
him
in
a
sword
duel
Truth
dies
a
lingering
death
representing
the
murder
of
man
s
higher
nature
by
selfishness
The
servant
hurries
back
to
his
mistress
with
the
news
of
the
death
of
her
lover
She
rushes
to
the
place
of
the
attack
and
finding
Truth
dead
falls
on
her
knees
beside
him
With
a
prayer
she
draws
her
dagger
and
stabbing
herself
dies
When
Selfishness
sees
that
Love
as
well
as
Truth
is
dead
he
becomes
infuriated
declares
there
is
no
God
and
swears
that
he
will
have
fullest
revenge
An
officer
Justice
arrives
and
handcuffing
the
murderer
takes
him
into
custody
after
which
follows
the
funeral
of
the
lovers
Justice
brings
selfishness
before
the
Judge
Wisdom
and
at
the
trial
the
witnesses
Knowledge
Drunkenness
Misery
Sickness
Miserliness
and
Robbery
all
testify
that
had
it
not
been
for
Selfishness
Love
and
Truth
had
not
died
Wisdom
then
banishes
Selfishness
from
the
land
During
a
psychic
circle
held
at
our
Institute
in
May
at
which
Sir
Arthur
Conan
Doyle
and
Lady
Doyle
were
present
this
play
was
given
and
later
in
his
book
Our
Second
American
Adventure
Sir
Arthur
briefly
described
the
play
commenting
further
It
was
certainly
a
most
extraordinary
performance
and
left
us
all
in
a
state
of
amazed
admiration
I
have
seen
all
the
greatest
actresses
of
my
generation
Modjeska
Bernhardt
Duse
Terry
but
I
do
not
think
that
any
one
of
them
could
have
played
these
eleven
parts
without
a
stage
or
a
costume
in
so
convincing
a
way
The
spirits
own
account
is
that
they
are
a
band
of
players
on
the
other
side
who
represent
this
play
before
the
undeveloped
dead
in
order
to
teach
them
the
moral
and
that
they
use
the
wonderful
mediumship
of
Mrs
Wickland
in
order
to
demonstrate
their
power
to
us
mortals
It
was
very
impressive
Recently
these
invisible
performers
have
presented
through
Mrs
Wickland
another
drama
The
Soul
s
Passion
Play
symbolical
of
the
development
of
the
soul
In
The
Morality
Play
Selfishness
kills
Truth
and
causes
the
death
of
Love
while
in
The
Soul
s
Passion
Play
Truth
and
Love
conquer
Selfishness
The
Soul
s
Passion
Play
represents
the
contest
of
the
Soul
with
opposing
principles
and
symbolizes
the
victory
of
Truth
and
Love
over
Selfishness
through
Understanding
and
the
attainment
of
Bliss
Dwelling
in
the
Home
of
Happiness
with
Obedience
as
the
servant
are
Kindness
and
Friendship
father
and
mother
of
the
maiden
Love
Truth
a
young
man
admires
Love
while
Selfishness
another
maiden
who
is
found
in
the
same
society
with
Love
but
whose
father
and
mother
are
Hatred
and
Envy
living
in
the
Home
of
Unhappiness
boldly
attempts
to
attract
the
young
man
to
herself
Truth
finally
wins
Love
and
they
are
united
in
marriage
after
having
sent
Selfishness
away
from
the
Home
of
Happiness
Selfishness
overcome
by
jealousy
and
humiliation
goes
to
seek
some
means
of
revenge
in
the
slums
where
in
the
Home
of
Misery
lives
the
villain
Revenge
with
his
father
and
mother
Temptation
and
Evil
Together
as
time
goes
on
they
plot
that
Selfishness
shall
return
to
the
Home
of
Happiness
and
pretending
repentance
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
steal
the
child
Victory
which
has
been
born
to
Love
and
Truth
The
child
is
to
be
given
to
Evil
who
will
bring
him
up
in
squalor
and
sordidness
forcing
him
to
commit
crimes
and
finally
become
imprisoned
Selfishness
will
then
go
to
Love
and
Truth
tell
them
of
the
disgrace
of
Victory
and
with
Revenge
gloat
over
the
ruin
of
the
Home
of
Happiness
Selfishness
succeeds
in
stealing
Victory
who
for
some
years
is
cruelly
mistreated
by
Evil
and
Temptation
but
is
at
last
discovered
by
his
parents
and
taken
away
from
the
Home
of
Misery
Enraged
at
her
defeat
Selfishness
becomes
insane
through
anger
and
dies
a
violent
death
Truth
and
Love
bring
Victory
back
into
the
Home
of
Happiness
and
there
with
Selfishness
vanquished
they
dwell
together
in
Bliss
CHAPTER
XVII
Conclusion
DEONSTRATIVE
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
much
which
now
seems
mysterious
can
be
brought
to
light
by
appropriate
research
The
supernatural
is
only
the
natural
not
yet
understood
Psychical
research
should
be
placed
on
a
scientific
basis
and
made
safe
and
sane
by
eliminating
the
dwellers
on
the
threshold
of
the
unseen
who
through
deception
and
falsehood
frequently
pervert
the
truth
which
the
enlightened
spirit
intelligences
are
constantly
endeavoring
to
convey
to
humanity
Advanced
intelligences
on
the
invisible
side
continually
urge
that
broad
minded
investigators
on
the
physical
plane
co
operate
with
them
in
establishing
research
centers
in
asylums
churches
universities
and
other
institutions
It
is
imperative
that
psychical
research
should
be
in
the
hands
of
men
of
science
men
who
are
willing
to
set
aside
prejudice
and
with
unbiased
minds
weigh
the
evidence
and
classify
findings
In
the
Chicago
Daily
Tribune
March
the
late
Dr
I
K
Funk
of
New
York
urged
that
inquiry
be
made
into
cases
of
mental
phenomena
and
after
reviewing
the
work
which
we
were
carrying
on
in
obsession
concluded
with
an
appeal
to
the
press
for
further
investigation
Let
us
remember
he
said
a
single
scientifically
demonstrated
fact
of
the
existence
of
even
an
evil
discarnate
spirit
will
do
more
to
prove
the
continuance
of
life
after
death
than
all
the
sermons
on
immortality
that
have
been
preached
in
the
last
ten
years
That
single
demonstration
would
be
the
death
knell
of
materialism
Genuine
cases
wherever
occurring
should
be
searched
for
by
the
press
more
than
if
they
were
lumps
of
gold
and
should
be
verified
if
possible
to
the
minutest
incident
and
given
not
jocosely
but
seriously
to
the
world
Why
will
not
the
press
soberly
take
up
this
matter
Rightly
handled
there
is
sensation
in
it
worthy
of
the
most
royal
purple
journalism
Gladstone
was
right
when
in
his
membership
letter
to
the
Society
for
Psychical
Research
he
said
that
this
work
of
investigation
is
the
most
important
work
which
is
being
done
in
the
world
by
far
the
most
important
Scientific
bodies
willing
to
thoroughly
master
and
observe
the
governing
laws
could
readily
obtain
evidence
similar
to
that
presented
in
this
volume
Especially
could
such
evidence
be
obtained
in
Institutions
for
the
Insane
as
most
inmates
of
the
same
are
potential
psychics
who
could
be
developed
into
instruments
for
psychical
research
After
having
dislodged
the
ignorant
obsessing
spirits
the
psychic
faculties
of
the
sensitive
could
be
developed
by
attracting
intelligent
spirits
who
are
always
willing
to
co
operate
from
the
invisible
side
and
who
will
protect
the
instrument
against
untoward
results
Psychic
research
circles
formed
to
learn
the
truth
of
life
and
spirit
existence
should
be
of
inestimable
value
to
churches
for
such
investigation
would
prove
positively
the
continued
existence
of
the
soul
and
convert
mere
faith
and
belief
in
a
life
hereafter
into
definite
knowledge
The
practice
of
calling
for
specific
or
particular
spirits
should
not
be
indulged
in
as
this
may
lead
to
deception
by
mischievous
spirits
who
may
step
in
and
attempt
to
impersonate
the
spirit
called
for
It
should
be
left
to
the
guiding
intelligences
to
bring
whatever
spirit
is
suitable
for
demonstration
and
interesting
information
will
be
given
from
time
to
time
by
the
advanced
spirits
clearly
showing
the
difference
between
intelligent
and
ignorant
entities
As
a
nucleus
for
more
comprehensive
investigation
the
National
Psychological
Institute
was
organized
and
incorporated
in
Los
Angeles
California
for
the
purpose
of
placing
these
problems
on
a
rational
scientific
basis
This
Institute
a
Spiritual
Clearing
House
has
no
interest
in
cult
or
ism
of
any
kind
but
is
striving
only
to
obtain
data
in
the
hope
of
encouraging
other
institutions
to
take
up
similar
work
as
an
enormous
field
for
research
has
been
opened
by
our
experiences
It
is
not
presumed
or
held
that
this
avenue
of
research
is
a
panacea
for
or
a
full
explanation
of
all
mental
aberrations
or
obscure
mortal
vagaries
but
indicative
of
the
need
for
fuller
knowledge
of
the
role
which
the
invisible
world
plays
in
human
problems
