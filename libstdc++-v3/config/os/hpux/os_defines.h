/* HP-UX, for reasons unknown choose to use a different name for
   the string to [unsigned] long long conversion routines.

   Furthermore, instead of having the prototypes in stdlib.h like
   everyone else, they put them into a non-standard header
   <inttypes.h>.  Ugh.

   <inttypes.h> defines a variety of things, some of which we
   probably do not want.  So we don't want to include it here.

   Luckily we can just declare strtoll and strtoull with the
   __asm extension which effectively renames calls at the
   source level without namespace pollution.

   Also note that the compiler defines _INCLUDE_LONGLONG for C++
   unconditionally, which makes intmax_t and uintmax_t long long
   types.  */
