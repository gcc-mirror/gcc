     The GNU Standard C++ Library v3 is an ongoing project to
     implement the ISO 14882 C++ Standard Library as described in
     clauses 20 through 33 and annex D (prior to the 2017 standard
     the library clauses started with 17).  For those who want to see

    The completion of the initial ISO C++ standardization effort gave the C++
    community a powerful set of reuseable tools in the form of the C++
    Standard Library.  However, for several years C++ implementations were

      The LGPL requires that users be able to replace the LGPL code with a
     modified version; this is trivial if the library in question is a C
     shared library.  But there's no way to make that work with C++, where
     much of the library consists of inline functions and templates, which
     are expanded inside the code that uses the library.  So to allow people
     to replace the library code, someone using the library would have to
     distribute their own source, rendering the LGPL equivalent to the GPL.

<qandaentry xml:id="faq.how_to_set_paths">
  <question xml:id="q-how_to_set_paths">
    <para>How do I insure that the dynamically linked library will be found?
    </para>
  </question>
  <answer xml:id="a-how_to_set_paths">
    <para>
    Depending on your platform and library version, the error message might
    be similar to one of the following:
    </para>

    <screen>
    ./a.out: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

    /usr/libexec/ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libstdc++.so.6" not found
    </screen>

    <para>
    This doesn't mean that the shared library isn't installed, only
    that the dynamic linker can't find it. When a dynamically-linked
    executable is run the linker finds and loads the required shared
    libraries by searching a pre-configured list of directories. If
    the directory where you've installed libstdc++ is not in this list
    then the libraries won't be found.
    </para>

    <para>
    If you already have an older version of libstdc++ installed then the
    error might look like one of the following instead:
    </para>

    <screen>
    ./a.out: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found
    ./a.out: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.8' not found
    </screen>

    <para>
    This means the linker found <filename>/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6</filename>
    but that library belongs to an older version of GCC than was used to
    compile and link the program <filename>a.out</filename> (or some part
    of it). The program depends on code defined in the newer libstdc++
    that belongs to the newer version of GCC, so the linker must be told
    how to find the newer libstdc++ shared library.
    </para>

    <para>
    The simplest way to fix this is
    to use the <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> environment variable,
    which is a colon-separated list of directories in which the linker
    will search for shared libraries:
    </para>

    <screen><command>
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${prefix}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    </command></screen>

    <para>
    Here the shell variable <varname>${prefix}</varname> is assumed to contain
    the directory prefix where GCC was installed to. The directory containing
    the library might depend on whether you want the 32-bit or 64-bit copy
    of the library, so for example would be
    <filename class="directory">${prefix}/lib64</filename> on some systems.
    The exact environment variable to use will depend on your
    platform, e.g. <envar>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> for Darwin,
    <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH_32</envar>/<envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64</envar>
    for Solaris 32-/64-bit,
    and <envar>SHLIB_PATH</envar> for HP-UX.
    </para>
    <para>
    See the man pages for <command>ld</command>, <command>ldd</command>
    and <command>ldconfig</command> for more information. The dynamic
    linker has different names on different platforms but the man page
    is usually called something such as <filename>ld.so</filename>,
    <filename>rtld</filename> or <filename>dld.so</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
    Using <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> is not always the best solution,

    <para>
      If the only functions from <filename class="libraryfile">libstdc++.a</filename>
      which you need are language support functions (those listed in
      <link linkend="std.support">clause 18</link> of the
      standard, e.g., <function>new</function> and
      <function>delete</function>), then try linking against

      instead of <command>g++</command> and explicitly linking in
      <filename class="libraryfile">libsupc++.a</filename> via <option>-lsupc++</option>
      for the final link step will do it).  This library contains only
      those support routines, one per object file.  But if you are
      using anything from the rest of the library, such as IOStreams
      or vectors, then you'll still need pieces from

  <question xml:id="q-size">
    <para>
      This library is HUGE!
    </para>
  </question>
  <answer xml:id="a-size">
    <para>
    Usually the size of libraries on disk isn't noticeable.  When a
    link editor (or simply <quote>linker</quote>) pulls things from a
    static archive library, only the necessary object files are copied
    into your executable, not the entire library.  Unfortunately, even
    if you only need a single function or variable from an object file,
    the entire object file is extracted.  (There's nothing unique to C++
    or libstdc++ about this; it's just common behavior, given here
    for background reasons.)
    </para>
    <para>
    Some of the object files which make up
    <filename class="libraryfile">libstdc++.a</filename> are rather large.
    If you create a statically-linked executable with
    <option>-static</option>, those large object files are suddenly part
    of your executable.  Historically the best way around this was to
    only place a very few functions (often only a single one) in each
    source/object file; then extracting a single function is the same
    as extracting a single <filename>.o</filename> file.  For libstdc++ this
    is only possible to a certain extent; the object files in question contain
    template classes and template functions, pre-instantiated, and
    splitting those up causes severe maintenance headaches.
    </para> 
    <para>
    On supported platforms, libstdc++ takes advantage of garbage
    collection in the GNU linker to get a result similar to separating
    each symbol into a separate source and object files. On these platforms,
    GNU ld can place each function and variable into its own
    section in a <filename>.o</filename> file.  The GNU linker can then perform
    garbage collection on unused sections; this reduces the situation to only
    copying needed functions into the executable, as before, but all
    happens automatically.

    However, the reality is that libstdc++ is targeted and optimized

    proprietary tools to support these constructs.

  </question>
  <answer xml:id="a-predefined">
      <para>On Solaris, <command>g++</command> (but not <command>gcc</command>)
         always defines the preprocessor macro
	 <constant>_XOPEN_SOURCE</constant>.  On GNU/Linux, the same happens

         other macros and other platforms are also affected.)
      </para>
      <para>These macros are typically used in C library headers, guarding new
         versions of functions from their older versions.  The C++98 standard
         library includes the C standard library, but it requires the C90
         version, which for backwards-compatibility reasons is often not the
         default for many vendors.
      </para>
      <para>More to the point, the C++ standard requires behavior which is only
         available on certain platforms after certain symbols are defined.
         Usually the issue involves I/O-related typedefs.  In order to
         ensure correctness, the compiler simply predefines those symbols.
      </para>
      <para>Note that it's not enough to <literal>#define</literal> them only when the library is
         being built (during installation).  Since we don't have an 'export'
         keyword, much of the library exists as headers, which means that
         the symbols must also be defined as your programs are parsed and
         compiled.

  <answer xml:id="a-memory_leaks">
    <para>
    Since GCC 5.1.0, libstdc++ automatically allocates a pool
    of a few dozen kilobytes on startup. This pool is used to ensure it's
    possible to throw exceptions (such as <classname>bad_alloc</classname>)
    even when <code>malloc</code> is unable to allocate any more memory.
    With some versions of <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://valgrind.org/"><command>valgrind</command></link>
    this pool will be shown as "still reachable" when the process exits, e.g.
    <code>still reachable: 72,704 bytes in 1 blocks</code>.
    This memory is not a leak, because it's still in use by libstdc++,
    and the memory will be returned to the OS when the process exits.
    Later versions of <command>valgrind</command> know how to free this
    pool as the process exits, and so won't show any "still reachable" memory.
    </para>
    <para>
    In the past, a few people reported that the standard containers appear
    to leak memory when tested with memory checkers such as
    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://valgrind.org/"><command>valgrind</command></link>.
    Under some (non-default) configurations the library's allocators keep
    free memory in a
    pool for later reuse, rather than deallocating it with <code>delete</code>
    Although this memory is always reachable by the library and is never
    lost, memory debugging tools can report it as a leak.  If you

    <link linkend="status.iso.tr1">on the TR1 status page</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
    New code should probably not use TR1, because almost everything in it has
    been added to the main C++ Standard Library (usually with significant
    improvements).
    The TR1 implementation in libstdc++ is no longer actively maintained.

  <question xml:id="q-what_is_abi">
    <para>
      What's an ABI and why is it so messy?
    </para>
  </question>
  <answer xml:id="a-what_is_abi">
    <para>
    <acronym>ABI</acronym> stands for <quote>Application Binary
    Interface</quote>.  Conventionally, it refers to a great
    mass of details about how arguments are arranged on the call
    stack and/or in registers, and how various types are arranged
    and padded in structs.  A single CPU design may suffer
    multiple ABIs designed by different development tool vendors
    who made different choices, or even by the same vendor for
    different target applications or compiler versions.  In ideal
    circumstances the CPU designer presents one ABI and all the
    OSes and compilers use it.  In practice every ABI omits
    details that compiler implementers (consciously or
    accidentally) must choose for themselves.
    </para>
    <para>
    That ABI definition suffices for compilers to generate code so a
    program can interact safely with an OS and its lowest-level libraries.
    Users usually want an ABI to encompass more detail, allowing libraries
    built with different compilers (or different releases of the same
    compiler!) to be linked together.  For C++, this includes many more
    details than for C, and most CPU designers (for good reasons elaborated
    below) have not stepped up to publish C++ ABIs.  Such an ABI has been
    defined for the Itanium architecture (see
    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/">C++
    ABI for Itanium</link>) and that is used by G++ and other compilers
    as the de facto standard ABI on many common architectures (including x86).
    G++ can also use the ARM architecture's EABI, for embedded
    systems relying only on a <quote>free-standing implementation</quote> that
    doesn't include (much of) the standard library, and the GNU EABI for
    hosted implementations on ARM.  Those ABIs cover low-level details
    such as virtual function implementation, struct inheritance layout,
    name mangling, and exception handling.
   </para>
    <para>
    A useful C++ ABI must also incorporate many details of the standard
    library implementation.  For a C ABI, the layouts of a few structs
    (such as <type>FILE</type>, <type>stat</type>, <type>jmpbuf</type>,
    and the like) and a few macros suffice.
    For C++, the details include the complete set of names of functions
    and types used, the offsets of class members and virtual functions,
    and the actual definitions of all inlines.  C++ exposes many more
    library details to the caller than C does.  It makes defining
    a complete ABI a much bigger undertaking, and requires not just
    documenting library implementation details, but carefully designing
    those details so that future bug fixes and optimizations don't
    force breaking the ABI.
    </para>
    <para>
    There are ways to help isolate library implementation details from the
    ABI, but they trade off against speed.  Library details used in inner
    loops (e.g., <function>getchar</function>) must be exposed and frozen for
    all time, but many others may reasonably be kept hidden from user code,
    so they may later be changed.  Deciding which, and implementing
    the decisions, must happen before you can reasonably document a
    candidate C++ ABI that encompasses the standard library.

    <para>
    Before C++11, the standard idiom for deallocating a
    <classname>vector&lt;T&gt;</classname>'s
    unused memory was to create a temporary copy of the vector and swap their
    contents, e.g. for <classname>vector&lt;T&gt; v</classname>

    <literallayout class="normal">
     std::vector&lt;T&gt;(v).swap(v);

    The copy will take O(n) time and the swap is constant time.
