  This is the anticipated common workflow for program <code>foo.cc</code>:
<programlisting>
$ cat foo.cc
#include &lt;vector&gt;
int main() {
  vector&lt;int&gt; v;
  for (int k = 0; k &lt; 1024; ++k) v.insert(v.begin(), k);
}

$ g++ -D_GLIBCXX_PROFILE foo.cc
$ ./a.out
$ cat libstdcxx-profile.txt
vector-to-list: improvement = 5: call stack = 0x804842c ...
    : advice = change std::vector to std::list
vector-size: improvement = 3: call stack = 0x804842c ...
    : advice = change initial container size from 0 to 1024
</programlisting>

  Anatomy of a warning:
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  Warning id.  This is a short descriptive string for the class
  that this warning belongs to.  E.g., "vector-to-list".
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  Estimated improvement.  This is an approximation of the benefit expected
  from implementing the change suggested by the warning.  It is given on
  a log10 scale.  Negative values mean that the alternative would actually
  do worse than the current choice.
  In the example above, 5 comes from the fact that the overhead of
  inserting at the beginning of a vector vs. a list is around 1024 * 1024 / 2,
  which is around 10e5.  The improvement from setting the initial size to
  1024 is in the range of 10e3, since the overhead of dynamic resizing is
  linear in this case.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  Call stack.  Currently, the addresses are printed without
  symbol name or code location attribution.
  Users are expected to postprocess the output using, for instance, addr2line.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para>
  The warning message.  For some warnings, this is static text, e.g.,
  "change vector to list".  For other warnings, such as the one above,
  the message contains numeric advice, e.g., the suggested initial size
  of the hashtable.
  </para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Two files are generated.  <code>libstdcxx-profile.txt</code>
   contains human readable advice.  <code>libstdcxx-profile.raw</code>
   contains implementation specific data about each diagnostic.
   Their format is not documented.  They are sufficient to generate
   all the advice given in <code>libstdcxx-profile.txt</code>.  The advantage
   of keeping this raw format is that traces from multiple executions can
   be aggregated simply by concatenating the raw traces.  We intend to
   offer an external utility program that can issue advice from a trace.
  </para>

  <para>Advice is given regardless whether the transformation is valid.
  For instance, we advise changing a map to an unordered_map even if the
  application semantics require that data be ordered.
  We believe such warnings can help users understand the performance
  behavior of their application better, which can lead to changes
  at a higher abstraction level.

 xreflabel="Wrapper">
<title>Wrapper Model</title>
  <para>
  In order to get our instrumented library version included instead of the
  release one,
  we use the same wrapper model as the debug mode.
  We subclass entities from the release version.  Wherever
  <code>_GLIBCXX_PROFILE</code> is defined, the release namespace is
  <code>std::__norm</code>, whereas the profile namespace is 
  <code>std::__profile</code>.  Using plain <code>std</code> translates
  into <code>std::__profile</code>.
  </para>
  <para>
  Whenever possible, we try to wrap at the public interface level, e.g.,
  in <code>unordered_set</code> rather than in <code>hashtable</code>, 
  in order not to depend on implementation.
  </para>
  <para>
  Mixing object files built with and without the profile mode must
  not affect the program execution.  However, there are no guarantees to
  the accuracy of diagnostics when using even a single object not built with
  <code>-D_GLIBCXX_PROFILE</code>.
  Currently, mixing the profile mode with debug and parallel extensions is
  not allowed.  Mixing them at compile time will result in preprocessor errors.
  Mixing them at link time is undefined.
  </para>
</sect2>


<sect2 id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.instrumentation" 
 xreflabel="Instrumentation">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
  <para>
  Instead of instrumenting every public entry and exit point,
  we chose to add instrumentation on demand, as needed
  by individual diagnostics.
  The main reason is that some diagnostics require us to extract bits of 
  internal state that are particular only to that diagnostic.
  We plan to formalize this later, after we learn more about the requirements
  of several diagnostics.
  </para>
  <para>
  All the instrumentation points can be switched on and off using 
  <code>-D[_NO]_GLIBCXX_PROFILE_&lt;diagnostic&gt;</code> options.
  With all the instrumentation calls off, there should be negligible
  overhead over the release version.  This property is needed to support
  diagnostics based on timing of internal operations.  For such diagnostics,
  we anticipate turning most of the instrumentation off in order to prevent
  profiling overhead from polluting time measurements, and thus diagnostics.
  </para>
  <para>
  All the instrumentation on/off compile time switches live in 
  <code>include/profile/profiler.h</code>.
  </para>
</sect2>


<sect2 id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.rtlib" 
 xreflabel="Run Time Behavior">
<title>Run Time Behavior</title>
  <para>
  For practical reasons, the instrumentation library processes the trace
  partially
  rather than dumping it to disk in raw form.  Each event is processed when
  it occurs.  It is usually attached a cost and it is aggregated into
  the database of a specific diagnostic class.  The cost model
  is based largely on the standard performance guarantees, but in some
  cases we use knowledge about GCC's standard library implementation.
  </para>
  <para>
  Information is indexed by (1) call stack and (2) instance id or address
  to be able to understand and summarize precise creation-use-destruction
  dynamic chains.  Although the analysis is sensitive to dynamic instances,
  the reports are only sensitive to call context.  Whenever a dynamic instance
  is destroyed, we accumulate its effect to the corresponding entry for the
  call stack of its constructor location.

  The input to the analysis is a table indexed by profile type and call stack.

<title>Cost Model</title>
  <para>
  While it is likely that cost models become complex as we get into 
  more sophisticated analysis, we will try to follow a simple set of rules
  at the beginning.
  </para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Relative benefit estimation:</emphasis>
  The idea is to estimate or measure the cost of all operations
  in the original scenario versus the scenario we advise to switch to.
  For instance, when advising to change a vector to a list, an occurrence
  of the <code>insert</code> method will generally count as a benefit.
  Its magnitude depends on (1) the number of elements that get shifted
  and (2) whether it triggers a reallocation.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Synthetic measurements:</emphasis>
  We will measure the relative difference between similar operations on
  different containers.  We plan to write a battery of small tests that
  compare the times of the executions of similar methods on different
  containers.  The idea is to run these tests on the target machine.
  If this training phase is very quick, we may decide to perform it at
  library initialization time.  The results can be cached on disk and reused
  across runs.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Timers:</emphasis>
  We plan to use timers for operations of larger granularity, such as sort.
  For instance, we can switch between different sort methods on the fly
  and report the one that performs best for each call context.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para><emphasis>Show stoppers:</emphasis>
  We may decide that the presence of an operation nullifies the advice.
  For instance, when considering switching from <code>set</code> to 
  <code>unordered_set</code>, if we detect use of operator <code>++</code>,
  we will simply not issue the advice, since this could signal that the use
  care require a sorted container.</para></listitem>

<sect2 id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.reports"
 xreflabel="Reports">
<title>Reports</title>
  <para>
There are two types of reports.  First, if we recognize a pattern for which
we have a substitute that is likely to give better performance, we print
the advice and estimated performance gain.  The advice is usually associated
to a code position and possibly a call stack.
  </para>
  <para>
Second, we report performance characteristics for which we do not have
a clear solution for improvement.  For instance, we can point to the user
the top 10 <code>multimap</code> locations
which have the worst data locality in actual traversals.
Although this does not offer a solution,
it helps the user focus on the key problems and ignore the uninteresting ones.

<sect2 id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.testing"
 xreflabel="Testing">
<title>Testing</title>
  <para>
  First, we want to make sure we preserve the behavior of the release mode.
  You can just type <code>"make check-profile"</code>, which
  builds and runs the whole test suite in profile mode.
  </para>
  <para>
  Second, we want to test the correctness of each diagnostic.
  We created a <code>profile</code> directory in the test suite.
  Each diagnostic must come with at least two tests, one for false positives
  and one for false negatives.

<sect1 id="manual.ext.profile_mode.api"
 xreflabel="API">
<title>Extensions for Custom Containers</title>

  <para>
  Many large projects use their own data structures instead of the ones in the
  standard library.  If these data structures are similar in functionality
  to the standard library, they can be instrumented with the same hooks
  that are used to instrument the standard library.
  The instrumentation API is exposed in file
  <code>profiler.h</code> (look for "Instrumentation hooks").
  </para>

<sect1 id="manual.ext.profile_mode.cost_model"
 xreflabel="Cost Model">
<title>Empirical Cost Model</title>

  <para>
  Currently, the cost model uses formulas with predefined relative weights
  for alternative containers or container implementations.  For instance,
  iterating through a vector is X times faster than iterating through a list.
  </para>

  (Under development.)
  We are working on customizing this to a particular machine by providing
  an automated way to compute the actual relative weights for operations

 xreflabel="Stack Traces">
<title>Stack Traces</title>
  <para>
  Accurate stack traces are needed during profiling since we group events by
  call context and dynamic instance.  Without accurate traces, diagnostics
  may be hard to interpret.  For instance, when giving advice to the user
  it is imperative to reference application code, not library code.
  </para>
  <para>
  Currently we are using the libc <code>backtrace</code> routine to get
  stack traces.
  <code>_GLIBCXX_PROFILE_STACK_DEPTH</code> can be set
  to 0 if you are willing to give up call context information, or to a small
  positive value to reduce run time overhead.

<title>Symbolization of Instruction Addresses</title>
  <para>
  The profiling and analysis phases use only instruction addresses.
  An external utility such as addr2line is needed to postprocess the result.

  <para>
  As much as we would like to avoid uses of stdlibc++ within our

  appealing.  We plan to use them as long as they are named properly 
  to avoid ambiguity.

<title>Malloc Hooks</title>
  <para>
  User applications/libraries can provide malloc hooks.
  When the implementation of the malloc hooks uses stdlibc++, there can
  be an infinite cycle between the profile mode instrumentation and the
  the malloc hook code.
  </para>
  <para>
  We protect against reentrance to the profile mode instrumentation code,
  which should avoid this problem in most cases.
  The protection mechanism is thread safe and exception safe.
  This mechanism does not prevent reentrance to the malloc hook itself,
  which could still result in deadlock, if, for instance, the malloc hook
  uses non-recursive locks.
  XXX: A definitive solution to this problem would be for the profile extension
  to use a custom allocator internally, and perhaps not to use libstdc++.

  First, get cache line size and page size from system.
  Then record iterator dereference sequences for which the value is a pointer.
  For each sequence within a container, issue a warning if successive pointer 
  addresses are not within cache lines and do not form a linear pattern
  (otherwise they may be prefetched by hardware).
  If they also step across page boundaries, make the warning stronger.
  </para>
  <para>The same analysis applies to containers other than vector.
  However, we cannot give the same advice for linked structures, such as list,
  as there is no random access to the n-th element.  The user may still be
  able to benefit from this information, for instance by employing frays (user
  level light weight threads) to hide the latency of chasing pointers.

  This analysis is a little oversimplified.  A better cost model could be
