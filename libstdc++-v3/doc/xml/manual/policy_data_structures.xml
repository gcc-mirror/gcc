      This is a library of policy-based elementary data structures:
      associative containers and priority queues. It is designed for
      high-performance, flexibility, semantic safety, and conformance to
      the corresponding containers in <literal>std</literal> and
      <literal>std::tr1</literal> (except for some points where it differs
      by design).

      </para>

      <para>
	An attempt is made to categorize the wide variety of possible
	container designs in terms of performance-impacting factors. These
	performance factors are translated into design policies and
	incorporated into container design.
      </para>

      <para>
	There is tension between unravelling factors into a coherent set of
	policies. Every attempt is made to make a minimal set of
	factors. However, in many cases multiple factors make for long
	template names. Every attempt is made to alias and use typedefs in
	the source files, but the generated names for external symbols can
	be large for binary files or debuggers.
      </para>

      <para>
	In many cases, the longer names allow capabilities and behaviours
	controlled by macros to also be unamibiguously emitted as distinct
	generated names.
      </para>

      <para>
	Specific issues found while unraveling performance factors in the
	design of associative containers and priority queues follow.

      <section xml:id="pbds.intro.issues.associative">
	<info><title>Associative</title></info>

	<para>
	  Associative containers depend on their composite policies to a very
	  large extent. Implicitly hard-wiring policies can hamper their
	  performance and limit their functionality. An efficient hash-based
	  container, for example, requires policies for testing key
	  equivalence, hashing keys, translating hash values into positions
	  within the hash table, and determining when and how to resize the
	  table internally. A tree-based container can efficiently support
	  order statistics, i.e. the ability to query what is the order of
	  each key within the sequence of keys in the container, but only if
	  the container is supplied with a policy to internally update
	  meta-data. There are many other such examples.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Ideally, all associative containers would share the same
	  interface. Unfortunately, underlying data structures and mapping
	  semantics differentiate between different containers. For example,
	  suppose one writes a generic function manipulating an associative
	  container.
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  template&lt;typename Cntnr&gt;
	  void
	  some_op_sequence(Cntnr&amp; r_cnt)
	  {
	  ...
	  }
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  Given this, then what can one assume about the instantiating
	  container? The answer varies according to its underlying data
	  structure. If the underlying data structure of
	  <literal>Cntnr</literal> is based on a tree or trie, then the order
	  of elements is well defined; otherwise, it is not, in general. If
	  the underlying data structure of <literal>Cntnr</literal> is based
	  on a collision-chaining hash table, then modifying
	  r_<literal>Cntnr</literal> will not invalidate its iterators' order;
	  if the underlying data structure is a probing hash table, then this
	  is not the case. If the underlying data structure is based on a tree
	  or trie, then a reference to the container can efficiently be split;
	  otherwise, it cannot, in general. If the underlying data structure
	  is a red-black tree, then splitting a reference to the container is
	  exception-free; if it is an ordered-vector tree, exceptions can be
	  thrown.

      <section xml:id="pbds.intro.issues.priority_queue">
	<info><title>Priority Que</title></info>

	<para>
	  Priority queues are useful when one needs to efficiently access a
	  minimum (or maximum) value as the set of values changes.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Most useful data structures for priority queues have a relatively
	  simple structure, as they are geared toward relatively simple
	  requirements. Unfortunately, these structures do not support access
	  to an arbitrary value, which turns out to be necessary in many
	  algorithms. Say, decreasing an arbitrary value in a graph
	  algorithm. Therefore, some extra mechanism is necessary and must be
	  invented for accessing arbitrary values. There are at least two
	  alternatives: embedding an associative container in a priority
	  queue, or allowing cross-referencing through iterators. The first
	  solution adds significant overhead; the second solution requires a
	  precise definition of iterator invalidation. Which is the next
	  point...
	</para>

	<para>
	  Priority queues, like hash-based containers, store values in an
	  order that is meaningless and undefined externally. For example, a
	  <code>push</code> operation can internally reorganize the
	  values. Because of this characteristic, describing a priority
	  queues' iterator is difficult: on one hand, the values to which
	  iterators point can remain valid, but on the other, the logical
	  order of iterators can change unpredictably.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Roughly speaking, any element that is both inserted to a priority
	  queue (e.g. through <code>push</code>) and removed
	  from it (e.g., through <code>pop</code>), incurs a
	  logarithmic overhead (in the amortized sense). Different underlying
	  data structures place the actual cost differently: some are
	  optimized for amortized complexity, whereas others guarantee that
	  specific operations only have a constant cost. One underlying data
	  structure might be chosen if modifying a value is frequent
	  (Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm), whereas a different one might
	  be chosen otherwise. Unfortunately, an array-based binary heap - an
	  underlying data structure that optimizes (in the amortized sense)
	  <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations, differs from the
	  others in terms of its invalidation guarantees. Other design
	  decisions also impact the cost and placement of the overhead, at the
	  expense of more difference in the kinds of operations that the
	  underlying data structure can support. These differences pose a
	  challenge when creating a uniform interface for priority queues.

      <para>
	Many fine associative-container libraries were already written,
	most notably, the C++ standard's associative containers. Why
	then write another library? This section shows some possible
	advantages of this library, when considering the challenges in
	the introduction. Many of these points stem from the fact that
	the ISO C++ process introduced associative-containers in a
	two-step process (first standardizing tree-based containers,
	only then adding hash-based containers, which are fundamentally
	different), did not standardize priority queues as containers,
	and (in our opinion) overloads the iterator concept.

	  <para>
	    Associative containers require a relatively large number of
	    policies to function efficiently in various settings. In some
	    cases this is needed for making their common operations more
	    efficient, and in other cases this allows them to support a
	    larger set of operations
	  </para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Hash-based containers, for example, support look-up and
		insertion methods (<function>find</function> and
		<function>insert</function>). In order to locate elements
		quickly, they are supplied a hash functor, which instruct
		how to transform a key object into some size type; a hash
		functor might transform <constant>"hello"</constant>
		into <constant>1123002298</constant>. A hash table, though,
		requires transforming each key object into some size-type
		type in some specific domain; a hash table with a 128-long
		table might transform <constant>"hello"</constant> into
		position <constant>63</constant>. The policy by which the
		hash value is transformed into a position within the table
		can dramatically affect performance.  Hash-based containers
		also do not resize naturally (as opposed to tree-based
		containers, for example). The appropriate resize policy is
		unfortunately intertwined with the policy that transforms
		hash value into a position within the table.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
		Tree-based containers, for example, also support look-up and
		insertion methods, and are primarily useful when maintaining
		order between elements is important. In some cases, though,
		one can utilize their balancing algorithms for completely
		different purposes.
	      </para>

	      <para>
		Figure A shows a tree whose each node contains two entries:
		a floating-point key, and some size-type
		<emphasis>metadata</emphasis> (in bold beneath it) that is
		the number of nodes in the sub-tree. (The root has key 0.99,
		and has 5 nodes (including itself) in its sub-tree.) A
		container based on this data structure can obviously answer
		efficiently whether 0.3 is in the container object, but it
		can also answer what is the order of 0.3 among all those in
		the container object: see <xref linkend="biblio.clrs2001"/>.

	      </para>

	      <para>
		As another example, Figure B shows a tree whose each node
		contains two entries: a half-open geometric line interval,
		and a number <emphasis>metadata</emphasis> (in bold beneath
		it) that is the largest endpoint of all intervals in its
		sub-tree.  (The root describes the interval <constant>[20,
		36)</constant>, and the largest endpoint in its sub-tree is
		99.) A container based on this data structure can obviously
		answer efficiently whether <constant>[3, 41)</constant> is
		in the container object, but it can also answer efficiently
		whether the container object has intervals that intersect
		<constant>[3, 41)</constant>. These types of queries are
		very useful in geometric algorithms and lease-management
		algorithms.
	      </para>

	      <para>
		It is important to note, however, that as the trees are
		modified, their internal structure changes. To maintain
		these invariants, one must supply some policy that is aware
		of these changes.  Without this, it would be better to use a
		linked list (in itself very efficient for these purposes).

	    The standard C++ library contains associative containers based on

	    A shows a collision-chaining hash-table, B shows a probing

	    a tree based on an ordered vector(implicit in the order of the

	    container with update policies.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Each of these data structures has some performance benefits, in
	    terms of speed, size or both. For now, note that vector-based trees
	    and probing hash tables manipulate memory more efficiently than
	    red-black trees and collision-chaining hash tables, and that
	    list-based associative containers are very useful for constructing
	    "multimaps".

	  <para>
	    Ideally, the underlying data structure

	    done with <varname>r_cnt</varname>.  Unfortunately, this is not
	    the case.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    For example, if <classname>Cntnr</classname>

	  <para>
	    Also, if <classname>Cntnr</classname> is tree-based, the type

	  </para>

	    There are various other differences based on the container's

	      <para>
		Containers based on all but E can guarantee that

	<section xml:id="motivation.associative.iterators">
	  <info><title>Iterators</title></info>
	  <para>
	    Iterators are centric to the design of the standard library
	    containers, because of the container/algorithm/iterator
	    decomposition that allows an algorithm to operate on a range
	    through iterators of some sequence.  Iterators, then, are useful
	    because they allow going over a
	    specific <emphasis>sequence</emphasis>.  The standard library
	    also uses iterators for accessing a
	    specific <emphasis>element</emphasis>: when an associative
	    container returns one through <function>find</function>. The
	    standard library consistently uses the same types of iterators
	    for both purposes: going over a range, and accessing a specific
	    found element. Before the introduction of hash-based containers
	    to the standard library, this made sense (with the exception of
	    priority queues, which are discussed later).
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Using the standard associative containers together with
	    non-order-preserving associative containers (and also because of
	    priority-queues container), there is a possible need for
	    different types of iterators for self-organizing containers:
	    the iterator concept seems overloaded to mean two different
	    things (in some cases). <!-- <remark> XXX

	    <para>
	      In our opinion, this problem is not caused just because
	      red-black trees are order preserving while
	      collision-chaining hash tables are (generally) not - it
	      is more fundamental. Most of the standard's containers
	      order sequences in a well-defined manner that is
	      determined by their <emphasis>interface</emphasis>:
	      calling <function>insert</function> on a tree-based
	      container modifies its sequence in a predictable way, as
	      does calling <function>push_back</function> on a list or
	      a vector. Conversely, collision-chaining hash tables,
	      probing hash tables, priority queues, and list-based
	      containers (which are very useful for "multimaps") are
	      self-organizing data structures; the effect of each
	      operation modifies their sequences in a manner that is
	      (practically) determined by their
	      <emphasis>implementation</emphasis>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Consequently, applying an algorithm to a sequence obtained from most
	      containers may or may not make sense, but applying it to a
	      sub-sequence of a self-organizing container does not.

	    <para>
	      In the graphic below, label A shows the simplest (and
	      most efficient) implementation of a collision-chaining
	      hash table.  The little box marked
	      <classname>point_iterator</classname> shows an object
	      that contains a pointer to the element's node. Note that
	      this "iterator" has no way to move to the next element (
	      it cannot support
	      <function>operator++</function>). Conversely, the little
	      box marked <classname>iterator</classname> stores both a
	      pointer to the element, as well as some other
	      information (the bucket number of the element). the
	      second iterator, then, is "heavier" than the first one-
	      it requires more time and space. If we were to use a
	      different container to cross-reference into this
	      hash-table using these iterators - it would take much
	      more space. As noted above, nothing much can be done by
	      incrementing these iterators, so why is this extra
	      information needed?
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Alternatively, one might create a collision-chaining hash-table
	      where the lists might be linked, forming a monolithic total-element
	      list, as in the graphic below, label B.  Here the iterators are as
	      light as can be, but the hash-table's operations are more
	      complicated.

	      It is well-known that tree-based and trie-based container

	    There are three main implementations of priority queues: the

	  <para>
	    Binary heaps are one of the most useful underlying
	    data structures for priority queues. They are very efficient in
	    terms of memory (since they don't require per-value structure
	    metadata), and have the best amortized <function>push</function> and

	    The standard library's <classname>priority_queue</classname>
	    implements this data structure as an adapter over a sequence,

	    This is indeed an elegant example of the adapter concept and
	    the algorithm/container/iterator decomposition. (See <xref linkend="biblio.nelson96stlpq"/>). There are

		<classname>std::priority_queue</classname> cannot erase values

		proportional to the maximal number of values it ever contained,
		and not to the number of values that it currently
		contains. (See <filename>performance/priority_queue_text_pop_mem_usage.cc</filename>.)

	<para>
	  For the most part, the policy-based containers containers in
	  namespace <literal>__gnu_pbds</literal> have the same interface as
	  the equivalent containers in the standard C++ library, except for
	  the names used for the container classes themselves. For example,
	  this shows basic operations on a collision-chaining hash-based
	  container:
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  #include &lt;ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.h&gt;

	  int main()
	  {
	  __gnu_pbds::cc_hash_table&lt;int, char&gt; c;
	  c[2] = 'b';
	  assert(c.find(1) == c.end());
	  };
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  The container is called
	  <classname>__gnu_pbds::cc_hash_table</classname> instead of
	  <classname>std::unordered_map</classname>, since <quote>unordered
	  map</quote> does not necessarily mean a hash-based map as implied by
	  the C++ library (C++11 or TR1). For example, list-based associative
	  containers, which are very useful for the construction of
	  "multimaps," are also unordered.
	</para>

	<para>This snippet shows a red-black tree based container:</para>

	<programlisting>
	  #include &lt;ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.h&gt;

	  int main()
	  {
	  __gnu_pbds::tree&lt;int, char&gt; c;
	  c[2] = 'b';
	  assert(c.find(2) != c.end());
	  };
	</programlisting>

	<para>The container is called <classname>tree</classname> instead of
	<classname>map</classname> since the underlying data structures are
	being named with specificity.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The member function naming convention is to strive to be the same as
	  the equivalent member functions in other C++ standard library
	  containers. The familiar methods are unchanged:
	  <function>begin</function>, <function>end</function>,
	  <function>size</function>, <function>empty</function>, and
	  <function>clear</function>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This isn't to say that things are exactly as one would expect, given
	  the container requirments and interfaces in the C++ standard.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The names of containers' policies and policy accessors are
	  different then the usual. For example, if <type>hash_type</type> is
	some type of hash-based container, then</para>

	<programlisting>
	  hash_type::hash_fn
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  gives the type of its hash functor, and if <varname>obj</varname> is
	  some hash-based container object, then
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  obj.get_hash_fn()
	</programlisting>

	<para>will return a reference to its hash-functor object.</para>


	<para>
	  Similarly, if <type>tree_type</type> is some type of tree-based
	  container, then
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  tree_type::cmp_fn
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  gives the type of its comparison functor, and if
	  <varname>obj</varname> is some tree-based container object,
	  then
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  obj.get_cmp_fn()
	</programlisting>

	<para>will return a reference to its comparison-functor object.</para>

	<para>
	  It would be nice to give names consistent with those in the existing
	  C++ standard (inclusive of TR1). Unfortunately, these standard
	  containers don't consistently name types and methods. For example,
	  <classname>std::tr1::unordered_map</classname> uses
	  <type>hasher</type> for the hash functor, but
	  <classname>std::map</classname> uses <type>key_compare</type> for
	  the comparison functor. Also, we could not find an accessor for
	  <classname>std::tr1::unordered_map</classname>'s hash functor, but
	  <classname>std::map</classname> uses <classname>compare</classname>
	  for accessing the comparison functor.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Instead, <literal>__gnu_pbds</literal> attempts to be internally
	  consistent, and uses standard-derived terminology if possible.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Another source of difference is in scope:
	  <literal>__gnu_pbds</literal> contains more types of associative
	  containers than the standard C++ library, and more opportunities
	  to configure these new containers, since different types of
	  associative containers are useful in different settings.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Namespace <literal>__gnu_pbds</literal> contains different classes for
	  hash-based containers, tree-based containers, trie-based containers,
	  and list-based containers.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Since associative containers share parts of their interface, they
	  are organized as a class hierarchy.
	</para>

	<para>Each type or method is defined in the most-common ancestor
	in which it makes sense.
	</para>

	<para>For example, all associative containers support iteration
	expressed in the following form:
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  const_iterator
	  begin() const;

	  iterator
	  begin();

	  const_iterator
	  end() const;

	  iterator
	  end();
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  But not all containers contain or use hash functors. Yet, both
	  collision-chaining and (general) probing hash-based associative
	  containers have a hash functor, so
	  <classname>basic_hash_table</classname> contains the interface:
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  const hash_fn&amp;
	  get_hash_fn() const;

	  hash_fn&amp;
	  get_hash_fn();
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  so all hash-based associative containers inherit the same
	  hash-functor accessor methods.
	</para>

	    Configuring via Template Parameters
	  </title>
	</info>

	<para>
	  In general, each of this library's containers is
	  parametrized by more policies than those of the standard library. For
	  example, the standard hash-based container is parametrized as
	  follows:
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  template&lt;typename Key, typename Mapped, typename Hash,
	  typename Pred, typename Allocator, bool Cache_Hashe_Code&gt;
	  class unordered_map;
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  and so can be configured by key type, mapped type, a functor
	  that translates keys to unsigned integral types, an equivalence
	  predicate, an allocator, and an indicator whether to store hash
	  values with each entry. this library's collision-chaining
	  hash-based container is parametrized as
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  template&lt;typename Key, typename Mapped, typename Hash_Fn,
	  typename Eq_Fn, typename Comb_Hash_Fn,
	  typename Resize_Policy, bool Store_Hash
	  typename Allocator&gt;
	  class cc_hash_table;
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  and so can be configured by the first four types of
	  <classname>std::tr1::unordered_map</classname>, then a
	  policy for translating the key-hash result into a position
	  within the table, then a policy by which the table resizes,
	  an indicator whether to store hash values with each entry,
	  and an allocator (which is typically the last template
	  parameter in standard containers).
	</para>

	<para>
	  Nearly all policy parameters have default values, so this
	  need not be considered for casual use. It is important to
	  note, however, that hash-based containers' policies can
	  dramatically alter their performance in different settings,
	  and that tree-based containers' policies can make them
	  useful for other purposes than just look-up.
	</para>


	<para>As opposed to associative containers, priority queues have
	relatively few configuration options. The priority queue is
	parametrized as follows:</para>
	<programlisting>
	  template&lt;typename Value_Type, typename Cmp_Fn,typename Tag,
	  typename Allocator&gt;
	  class priority_queue;
	</programlisting>

	<para>The <classname>Value_Type</classname>, <classname>Cmp_Fn</classname>, and
	<classname>Allocator</classname> parameters are the container's value type,
	comparison-functor type, and allocator type, respectively;
	these are very similar to the standard's priority queue. The
	<classname>Tag</classname> parameter is different: there are a number of
	pre-defined tag types corresponding to binary heaps, binomial
	heaps, etc., and <classname>Tag</classname> should be instantiated
	by one of them.</para>

	<para>Note that as opposed to the
	<classname>std::priority_queue</classname>,
	<classname>__gnu_pbds::priority_queue</classname> is not a
	sequence-adapter; it is a regular container.</para>

      <section xml:id="pbds.using.tutorial.point_range_iteration">
	<info>
	  <title>
	    Point and Range Iteration
	  </title>
	</info>
	<para></para>

	<para>This library differentiates between two types of methods
	and iterators: point-type, and range-type. For example,
	<function>find</function> and <function>insert</function> are point-type methods, since
	they each deal with a specific element; their returned
	iterators are point-type iterators. <function>begin</function> and
	<function>end</function> are range-type methods, since they are not used to
	find a specific element, but rather to go over all elements in
	a container object; their returned iterators are range-type
	iterators.
	</para>

	<para>Most containers store elements in an order that is
	determined by their interface. Correspondingly, it is fine that
	their point-type iterators are synonymous with their range-type
	iterators. For example, in the following snippet
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  std::for_each(c.find(1), c.find(5), foo);
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  two point-type iterators (returned by <function>find</function>) are used
	  for a range-type purpose - going over all elements whose key is
	  between 1 and 5.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Conversely, the above snippet makes no sense for
	  self-organizing containers - ones that order (and reorder)
	  their elements by implementation. It would be nice to have a
	  uniform iterator system that would allow the above snippet to
	  compile only if it made sense.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This could trivially be done by specializing
	  <function>std::for_each</function> for the case of iterators returned by
	  <classname>std::tr1::unordered_map</classname>, but this would only solve the
	  problem for one algorithm and one container. Fundamentally, the
	  problem is that one can loop using a self-organizing
	  container's point-type iterators.
	</para>

	<para>
	  This library's containers define two families of
	  iterators: <type>point_const_iterator</type> and
	  <type>point_iterator</type> are the iterator types returned by
	  point-type methods; <type>const_iterator</type> and
	  <type>iterator</type> are the iterator types returned by range-type
	  methods.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  class &lt;- some container -&gt;
	  {
	  public:
	  ...

	  typedef &lt;- something -&gt; const_iterator;

	  typedef &lt;- something -&gt; iterator;

	  typedef &lt;- something -&gt; point_const_iterator;

	  typedef &lt;- something -&gt; point_iterator;

	  ...

	  public:
	  ...

	  const_iterator begin () const;

	  iterator begin();

	  point_const_iterator find(...) const;

	  point_iterator find(...);
	  };
	</programlisting>

	<para>For
	containers whose interface defines sequence order , it
	is very simple: point-type and range-type iterators are exactly
	the same, which means that the above snippet will compile if it
	is used for an order-preserving associative container.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For self-organizing containers, however, (hash-based
	  containers as a special example), the preceding snippet will
	  not compile, because their point-type iterators do not support
	  <function>operator++</function>.
	</para>

	<para>In any case, both for order-preserving and self-organizing
	containers, the following snippet will compile:
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  typename Cntnr::point_iterator it = c.find(2);
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  because a range-type iterator can always be converted to a
	  point-type iterator.
	</para>

	<para>Distingushing between iterator types also
	raises the point that a container's iterators might have
	different invalidation rules concerning their de-referencing
	abilities and movement abilities. This now corresponds exactly
	to the question of whether point-type and range-type iterators
	are valid. As explained above, <classname>container_traits</classname> allows
	querying a container for its data structure attributes. The
	iterator-invalidation guarantees are certainly a property of
	the underlying data structure, and so
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  container_traits&lt;C&gt;::invalidation_guarantee
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  gives one of three pre-determined types that answer this
	  query.

      <para>
	Associative containers are typically parametrized by various
	policies. For example, a hash-based associative container is
	parametrized by a hash-functor, transforming each key into an
	non-negative numerical type. Each such value is then further mapped
	into a position within the table. The mapping of a key into a
	position within the table is therefore a two-step process.
      </para>

      <para>
	In some cases, instantiations are redundant. For example, when the
	keys are integers, it is possible to use a redundant hash policy,
	which transforms each key into its value.
      </para>

      <para>
	In some other cases, these policies are irrelevant.  For example, a
	hash-based associative container might transform keys into positions
	within a table by a different method than the two-step method
	described above. In such a case, the hash functor is simply
	irrelevant.
      </para>

      <para>
	When a policy is either redundant or irrelevant, it can be replaced
	by <classname>null_type</classname>.
      </para>

      <para>
	For example, a <emphasis>set</emphasis> is an associative
	container with one of its template parameters (the one for the
	mapped type) replaced with <classname>null_type</classname>. Other
	places simplifications are made possible with this technique
	include node updates in tree and trie data structures, and hash
	and probe functions for hash data structures.

	  <title>
	    Distinguishing Between Maps and Sets
	  </title>
	</info>

	<para>
	  Anyone familiar with the standard knows that there are four kinds
	  of associative containers: maps, sets, multimaps, and
	  multisets. The map datatype associates each key to
	  some data.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Sets are associative containers that simply store keys -
	  they do not map them to anything. In the standard, each map class
	  has a corresponding set class. E.g.,
	  <classname>std::map&lt;int, char&gt;</classname> maps each
	  <classname>int</classname> to a <classname>char</classname>, but
	  <classname>std::set&lt;int, char&gt;</classname> simply stores
	  <classname>int</classname>s. In this library, however, there are no
	  distinct classes for maps and sets. Instead, an associative
	  container's <classname>Mapped</classname> template parameter is a policy: if
	  it is instantiated by <classname>null_type</classname>, then it
	  is a "set"; otherwise, it is a "map". E.g.,
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  cc_hash_table&lt;int, char&gt;
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  is a "map" mapping each <type>int</type> value to a <type>
	  char</type>, but
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  cc_hash_table&lt;int, null_type&gt;
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  is a type that uniquely stores <type>int</type> values.
	</para>
	<para>Once the <classname>Mapped</classname> template parameter is instantiated
	by <classname>null_type</classname>, then
	the "set" acts very similarly to the standard's sets - it does not
	map each key to a distinct <classname>null_type</classname> object. Also,
	, the container's <type>value_type</type> is essentially
	its <type>key_type</type> - just as with the standard's sets
	.</para>

	<para>
	  The standard's multimaps and multisets allow, respectively,
	  non-uniquely mapping keys and non-uniquely storing keys. As
	  discussed, the
	  reasons why this might be necessary are 1) that a key might be
	  decomposed into a primary key and a secondary key, 2) that a
	  key might appear more than once, or 3) any arbitrary
	  combination of 1)s and 2)s. Correspondingly,
	  one should use 1) "maps" mapping primary keys to secondary
	  keys, 2) "maps" mapping keys to size types, or 3) any arbitrary
	  combination of 1)s and 2)s. Thus, for example, an
	  <classname>std::multiset&lt;int&gt;</classname> might be used to store
	  multiple instances of integers, but using this library's
	  containers, one might use
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  tree&lt;int, size_t&gt;
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  i.e., a <classname>map</classname> of <type>int</type>s to
	  <type>size_t</type>s.
	</para>
	<para>
	  These "multimaps" and "multisets" might be confusing to
	  anyone familiar with the standard's <classname>std::multimap</classname> and
	  <classname>std::multiset</classname>, because there is no clear
	  correspondence between the two. For example, in some cases
	  where one uses <classname>std::multiset</classname> in the standard, one might use
	  in this library a "multimap" of "multisets" - i.e., a
	  container that maps primary keys each to an associative
	  container that maps each secondary key to the number of times
	  it occurs.
	</para>

	<para>
	  When one uses a "multimap," one should choose with care the
	  type of container used for secondary keys.

	<para>
	  Brace onself: this library does not contain containers like
	  <classname>std::multimap</classname> or
	  <classname>std::multiset</classname>. Instead, these data
	  structures can be synthesized via manipulation of the
	  <classname>Mapped</classname> template parameter.
	</para>
	<para>
	  One maps the unique part of a key - the primary key, into an
	  associative-container of the (originally) non-unique parts of
	  the key - the secondary key. A primary associative-container
	  is an associative container of primary keys; a secondary
	  associative-container is an associative container of
	  secondary keys.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Stepping back a bit, and starting in from the beginning.
	</para>


	<para>
	  Maps (or sets) allow mapping (or storing) unique-key values.
	  The standard library also supplies associative containers which
	  map (or store) multiple values with equivalent keys:
	  <classname>std::multimap</classname>, <classname>std::multiset</classname>,
	  <classname>std::tr1::unordered_multimap</classname>, and
	  <classname>unordered_multiset</classname>. We first discuss how these might
	  be used, then why we think it is best to avoid them.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Suppose one builds a simple bank-account application that
	  records for each client (identified by an <classname>std::string</classname>)
	  and account-id (marked by an <type>unsigned long</type>) -
	  the balance in the account (described by a
	  <type>float</type>). Suppose further that ordering this
	  information is not useful, so a hash-based container is
	  preferable to a tree based container. Then one can use
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  std::tr1::unordered_map&lt;std::pair&lt;std::string, unsigned long&gt;, float, ...&gt;
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  which hashes every combination of client and account-id. This
	  might work well, except for the fact that it is now impossible
	  to efficiently list all of the accounts of a specific client
	  (this would practically require iterating over all
	  entries). Instead, one can use
	</para>

	<programlisting>
	  std::tr1::unordered_multimap&lt;std::pair&lt;std::string, unsigned long&gt;, float, ...&gt;
	</programlisting>

	<para>
	  which hashes every client, and decides equivalence based on
	  client only. This will ensure that all accounts belonging to a
	  specific user are stored consecutively.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Also, suppose one wants an integers' priority queue
	  (a container that supports <function>push</function>,
	  <function>pop</function>, and <function>top</function> operations, the last of which
	  returns the largest <type>int</type>) that also supports
	  operations such as <function>find</function> and <function>lower_bound</function>. A
	  reasonable solution is to build an adapter over
	  <classname>std::set&lt;int&gt;</classname>. In this adapter,
	  <function>push</function> will just call the tree-based
	  associative container's <function>insert</function> method; <function>pop</function>
	  will call its <function>end</function> method, and use it to return the
	  preceding element (which must be the largest). Then this might
	  work well, except that the container object cannot hold
	  multiple instances of the same integer (<function>push(4)</function>,
	  will be a no-op if <constant>4</constant> is already in the
	  container object). If multiple keys are necessary, then one
	  might build the adapter over an
	  <classname>std::multiset&lt;int&gt;</classname>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The standard library's non-unique-mapping containers are useful
	  when (1) a key can be decomposed in to a primary key and a
	  secondary key, (2) a key is needed multiple times, or (3) any
	  combination of (1) and (2).
	</para>

	<para>
	  The graphic below shows how the standard library's container
	  design works internally; in this figure nodes shaded equally
	  represent equivalent-key values. Equivalent keys are stored
	  consecutively using the properties of the underlying data
	  structure: binary search trees (label A) store equivalent-key
	  values consecutively (in the sense of an in-order walk)
	  naturally; collision-chaining hash tables (label B) store
	  equivalent-key values in the same bucket, the bucket can be
	  arranged so that equivalent-key values are consecutive.

	  Put differently, the standards' non-unique mapping
	  associative-containers are associative containers that map
	  primary keys to linked lists that are embedded into the
	  container. The graphic below shows again the two
	  containers from the first graphic above, this time with
	  the embedded linked lists of the grayed nodes marked

	  These embedded linked lists have several disadvantages.
	</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The underlying data structure embeds the linked lists
	      according to its own consideration, which means that the
	      search path for a value might include several different
	      equivalent-key values. For example, the search path for the
	      the black node in either of the first graphic, labels A or B,
	      includes more than a single gray node.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The links of the linked lists are the underlying data
	      structures' nodes, which typically are quite structured.  In
	      the case of tree-based containers (the grapic above, label
	      B), each "link" is actually a node with three pointers (one
	      to a parent and two to children), and a
	      relatively-complicated iteration algorithm. The linked
	      lists, therefore, can take up quite a lot of memory, and
	      iterating over all values equal to a given key (through the
	      return value of the standard
	      library's <function>equal_range</function>) can be
	      expensive.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The primary key is stored multiply; this uses more memory.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Finally, the interface of this design excludes several
	      useful underlying data structures. Of all the unordered
	      self-organizing data structures, practically only
	      collision-chaining hash tables can (efficiently) guarantee
	      that equivalent-key values are stored consecutively.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>
	  The above reasons hold even when the ratio of secondary keys to
	  primary keys (or average number of identical keys) is small, but
	  when it is large, there are more severe problems:
	</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The underlying data structures order the links inside each
	      embedded linked-lists according to their internal
	      considerations, which effectively means that each of the
	      links is unordered. Irrespective of the underlying data
	      structure, searching for a specific value can degrade to
	      linear complexity.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Similarly to the above point, it is impossible to apply
	      to the secondary keys considerations that apply to primary
	      keys. For example, it is not possible to maintain secondary
	      keys by sorted order.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      While the interface "understands" that all equivalent-key
	      values constitute a distinct list (through
	      <function>equal_range</function>), the underlying data
	      structure typically does not. This means that operations such
	      as erasing from a tree-based container all values whose keys
	      are equivalent to a a given key can be super-linear in the
	      size of the tree; this is also true also for several other
	      operations that target a specific list.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	</orderedlist>

	<para>
	  In this library, all associative containers map
	  (or store) unique-key values. One can (1) map primary keys to
	  secondary associative-containers (containers of
	  secondary keys) or non-associative containers (2) map identical
	  keys to a size-type representing the number of times they
	  occur, or (3) any combination of (1) and (2). Instead of
	  allowing multiple equivalent-key values, this library
	  supplies associative containers based on underlying

	    <para>Let U be a domain (e.g., the integers, or the
	    strings of 3 characters). A hash-table algorithm needs to map
	    elements of U "uniformly" into the range [0,..., m -
	    1] (where m is a non-negative integral value, and
	    is, in general, time varying). I.e., the algorithm needs

	    Z<subscript>+</subscript>,</para>

	    <para>which maps a non-negative hash value, and a non-negative

	    <para>From the above, it is obvious that given g and

	    is not true). The standard's hash-based containers allow specifying
	    a hash function, and use a hard-wired range-hashing function;
	    the ranged-hash function is implicitly composed.</para>

	    <para>The above describes the case where a key is to be mapped
	    into a single position within a hash table, e.g.,
	    in a collision-chaining table. In other cases, a key is to be
	    mapped into a sequence of positions within a table,
	    e.g., in a probing table. Similar terms apply in this
	    case: the table requires a ranged probe function,
	    mapping a key into a sequence of positions withing the table.
	    This is typically achieved by composing a hash function
	    mapping the key into a non-negative integral type, a
	    probe function transforming the hash value into a
	    sequence of hash values, and a range-hashing function
	    transforming the sequence of hash values into a sequence of
	    positions.</para>

	    <para>The % (modulo) implementation has the advantage that for

	    <para>The &amp; (bit-mask) implementation has the advantage of

	    <para>In cases it is beneficial to allow the

	    true, that the writer of the ranged-hash function cannot rely
	    on the values of m having specific numerical properties
	    suitable for hashing (in the sense used in <xref linkend="biblio.knuth98sorting"/>), since
	    the values of m are determined by a resize policy with
	    possibly orthogonal considerations.</para>

	    <para>There are two cases where a ranged-hash function can be

	    <para>Hash-tables, as opposed to trees, do not naturally grow or
	    shrink. It is necessary to specify policies to determine how
	    and when a hash table should change its size. Usually, resize
	    policies can be decomposed into orthogonal policies:</para>

	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem><para>A size policy indicating how a hash table
	      should grow (e.g., it should multiply by powers of
	      2).</para></listitem>

	      <listitem><para>A trigger policy indicating when a hash
	      table should grow (e.g., a load factor is
	      exceeded).</para></listitem>

	  <section xml:id="resize_policies.size">
	    <info><title>Size Policies</title></info>


	    <para>Size policies determine how a hash table changes size. These
	    policies are simple, and there are relatively few sensible
	    options. An exponential-size policy (with the initial size and
	    growth factors both powers of 2) works well with a mask-based
	    range-hashing function, and is the
	    hard-wired policy used by Dinkumware. A
	    prime-list based policy works well with a modulo-prime range
	    hashing function and is the hard-wired policy used by SGI's
	    implementation.</para>

	  </section>

	  <section xml:id="resize_policies.trigger">
	    <info><title>Trigger Policies</title></info>

	    <para>Trigger policies determine when a hash table changes size.
	    Following is a description of two policies: load-check
	    policies, and collision-check policies.</para>

	    <para>Load-check policies are straightforward. The user specifies
	    two factors, Α<subscript>min</subscript> and
	    Α<subscript>max</subscript>, and the hash table maintains the
	    invariant that</para>

	    <para>Α<subscript>min</subscript> ≤ (number of
	    stored elements) / (hash-table size) ≤
	    Α<subscript>max</subscript>
            <!-- <remark>load factor min max</remark> -->
            </para>

	    <para>Collision-check policies work in the opposite direction of
	    load-check policies. They focus on keeping the number of
	    collisions moderate and hoping that the size of the table will
	    not grow very large, instead of keeping a moderate load-factor
	    and hoping that the number of collisions will be small. A
	    maximal collision-check policy resizes when the longest
	    probe-sequence grows too large.</para>

	    <para>Consider the graphic below. Let the size of the hash table
	    be denoted by m, the length of a probe sequence be denoted by k,
	    and some load factor be denoted by Α. We would like to
	    calculate the minimal length of k, such that if there were Α
	    m elements in the hash table, a probe sequence of length k would
	    be found with probability at most 1/m.</para>

	    <section xml:id="resize_policies.impl.decomposition">
	      <info><title>Decomposition</title></info>


	      <para>Each hash-based container is parametrized by a
	      <classname>Resize_Policy</classname> parameter; the container derives
	      <classname>public</classname>ly from <classname>Resize_Policy</classname>. For

		cc_hash_table&lt;typename Key,

		typename Resize_Policy

	      </programlisting>

	      <para>As a container object is modified, it continuously notifies
	      its <classname>Resize_Policy</classname> base of internal changes
	      (e.g., collisions encountered and elements being
	      inserted). It queries its <classname>Resize_Policy</classname> base whether
	      it needs to be resized, and if so, to what size.</para>

	      <para>The graphic below shows a (possible) sequence diagram
	      of an insert operation. The user inserts an element; the hash
	      table notifies its resize policy that a search has started
	      (point A); in this case, a single collision is encountered -
	      the table notifies its resize policy of this (point B); the
	      container finally notifies its resize policy that the search
	      has ended (point C); it then queries its resize policy whether
	      a resize is needed, and if so, what is the new size (points D
	      to G); following the resize, it notifies the policy that a
	      resize has completed (point H); finally, the element is
	      inserted, and the policy notified (point I).</para>

	      <para>In practice, a resize policy can be usually orthogonally
	      decomposed to a size policy and a trigger policy. Consequently,

	      policy: <classname>hash_standard_resize_policy</classname>
	      is parametrized by <classname>Size_Policy</classname> and

	    </section>

	    <section xml:id="resize_policies.impl.internals">
	      <info><title>Controling Access to Internals</title></info>

	      <para>There are cases where (controlled) access to resize
	      policies' internals is beneficial. E.g., it is sometimes
	      useful to query a hash-table for the table's actual size (as
	      opposed to its <function>size()</function> - the number of values it
	      currently holds); it is sometimes useful to set a table's
	      initial size, externally resize it, or change load factors.</para>

	      <para>Clearly, supporting such methods both decreases the
	      encapsulation of hash-based containers, and increases the
	      diversity between different associative-containers' interfaces.
	      Conversely, omitting such methods can decrease containers'
	      flexibility.</para>

	      <para>In order to avoid, to the extent possible, the above
	      conflict, the hash-based containers themselves do not address
	      any of these questions; this is deferred to the resize policies,
	      which are easier to change or replace. Thus, for example,
	      neither <classname>cc_hash_table</classname> nor
	      <classname>gp_hash_table</classname>
	      contain methods for querying the actual size of the table; this
	      is deferred to <classname>hash_standard_resize_policy</classname>.</para>

	      <para>Furthermore, the policies themselves are parametrized by
	      template arguments that determine the methods they support
	      (
	      <xref linkend="biblio.alexandrescu01modern"/>
	      shows techniques for doing so). <classname>hash_standard_resize_policy</classname>
	      is parametrized by <classname>External_Size_Access</classname> that
	      determines whether it supports methods for querying the actual
	      size of the table or resizing it. <classname>hash_load_check_resize_trigger</classname>
	      is parametrized by <classname>External_Load_Access</classname> that
	      determines whether it supports methods for querying or
	      modifying the loads. <classname>cc_hash_max_collision_check_resize_trigger</classname>
	      is parametrized by <classname>External_Load_Access</classname> that
	      determines whether it supports methods for querying the
	      load.</para>

	      <para>Some operations, for example, resizing a container at
	      run time, or changing the load factors of a load-check trigger
	      policy, require the container itself to resize. As mentioned
	      above, the hash-based containers themselves do not contain
	      these types of methods, only their resize policies.
	      Consequently, there must be some mechanism for a resize policy
	      to manipulate the hash-based container. As the hash-based
	      container is a subclass of the resize policy, this is done
	      through virtual methods. Each hash-based container has a
	      <classname>private</classname> <classname>virtual</classname> method:</para>
	      <programlisting>
		virtual void
		do_resize
		(size_type new_size);
	      </programlisting>

	      <para>which resizes the container. Implementations of
	      <classname>Resize_Policy</classname> can export public methods for resizing
	      the container externally; these methods internally call
	      <classname>do_resize</classname> to resize the table.</para>

	<section xml:id="container.hash.details.policy_interaction">

	  <para>
	  </para>
	  <para>Hash-tables are unfortunately especially susceptible to
	  choice of policies. One of the more complicated aspects of this
	  is that poor combinations of good policies can form a poor
	  container. Following are some considerations.</para>

	  <section xml:id="policy_interaction.probesizetrigger">
	    <info><title>probe/size/trigger</title></info>

	    <para>Some combinations do not work well for probing containers.
	    For example, combining a quadratic probe policy with an
	    exponential size policy can yield a poor container: when an
	    element is inserted, a trigger policy might decide that there
	    is no need to resize, as the table still contains unused
	    entries; the probe sequence, however, might never reach any of
	    the unused entries.</para>

	    <para>Unfortunately, this library cannot detect such problems at
	    compilation (they are halting reducible). It therefore defines
	    an exception class <classname>insert_error</classname> to throw an
	    exception in this case.</para>

	  </section>

	  <section xml:id="policy_interaction.hashtrigger">
	    <info><title>hash/trigger</title></info>

	    <para>Some trigger policies are especially susceptible to poor
	    hash functions. Suppose, as an extreme case, that the hash
	    function transforms each key to the same hash value. After some
	    inserts, a collision detecting policy will always indicate that
	    the container needs to grow.</para>

	    <para>The library, therefore, by design, limits each operation to
	    one resize. For each <classname>insert</classname>, for example, it queries
	    only once whether a resize is needed.</para>

	  </section>

	  <section xml:id="policy_interaction.eqstorehash">
	    <info><title>equivalence functors/storing hash values/hash</title></info>

	    <para><classname>cc_hash_table</classname> and
	    <classname>gp_hash_table</classname> are
	    parametrized by an equivalence functor and by a
	    <classname>Store_Hash</classname> parameter. If the latter parameter is
	    <classname>true</classname>, then the container stores with each entry
	    a hash value, and uses this value in case of collisions to
	    determine whether to apply a hash value. This can lower the
	    cost of collision for some types, but increase the cost of
	    collisions for other types.</para>

	    <para>If a ranged-hash function or ranged probe function is
	    directly supplied, however, then it makes no sense to store the
	    hash value with each entry. This library's container will
	    fail at compilation, by design, if this is attempted.</para>

	    sizes 8, 16, 32, 64, ...</para>

	    <para>If a load-check trigger policy is used, with loads
	    α<subscript>min</subscript> and α<subscript>max</subscript>,
	    respectively, then it is a good idea to have:</para>

	    <para>Each tree-based container defines two additional iterator

	    These iterators allow descending from a node to one of its

	    <para>The tree-based containers are parametrized by a

	    tree-based container instantiates
	    <classname>Node_Update</classname> to some
	    <classname>node_update</classname> class, and publicly subclasses
	    <classname>node_update</classname>. The graphic below shows this

	    <para><classname>node_update</classname> (an instantiation of

	    the type of metadata it requires. For order statistics,
	    e.g., <classname>metadata_type</classname> might be <classname>size_t</classname>.
	    The tree defines within each node a <classname>metadata_type</classname>

	    <para><classname>node_update</classname> must also define the following method

	    just-after-leaf node. This method should correct the node
	    invariants of the node pointed to by

	    y and z have valid invariants. After the invocation, all three

	    <para>To complete the description of the scheme, three questions
	    need to be answered:</para>

	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem><para>How can a tree which supports order statistics define a
	      method such as <classname>find_by_order</classname>?</para></listitem>

	      <listitem><para>How can the node updater base access methods of the
	      tree?</para></listitem>

	      <listitem><para>How can the following cyclic dependency be resolved?
	      <classname>node_update</classname> is a base class of the tree, yet it
	      uses node iterators defined in the tree (its child).</para></listitem>
	    </orderedlist>

	    <para>The first two questions are answered by the fact that
	    <classname>node_update</classname> (an instantiation of
	    <classname>Node_Update</classname>) is a <emphasis>public</emphasis> base class
	    of the tree. Consequently:</para>

	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem><para>Any public methods of
	      <classname>node_update</classname> are automatically methods of
	      the tree (<xref linkend="biblio.alexandrescu01modern"/>).
	      Thus an order-statistics node updater,
	      <classname>tree_order_statistics_node_update</classname> defines
	      the <function>find_by_order</function> method; any tree
	      instantiated by this policy consequently supports this method as
	      well.</para></listitem>

	      <listitem><para>In C++, if a base class declares a method as
	      <literal>virtual</literal>, it is
	      <literal>virtual</literal> in its subclasses. If
	      <classname>node_update</classname> needs to access one of the
	      tree's methods, say the member function
	      <function>end</function>, it simply declares that method as
	      <literal>virtual</literal> abstract.</para></listitem>
	    </orderedlist>

	    <para>The cyclic dependency is solved through template-template
	    parameters. <classname>Node_Update</classname> is parametrized by
	    the tree's node iterators, its comparison functor, and its
	    allocator type. Thus, instantiations of
	    <classname>Node_Update</classname> have all information
	    required.</para>

	    <para>This library assumes that constructing a metadata object and
	    modifying it are exception free. Suppose that during some method,
	    say <classname>insert</classname>, a metadata-related operation
	    (e.g., changing the value of a metadata) throws an exception. Ack!
	    Rolling back the method is unusually complex.</para>

	    <para>Previously, a distinction was made between redundant
	    policies and null policies. Node invariants show a
	    case where null policies are required.</para>

	    <para>Assume a regular tree is required, one which need not
	    support order statistics or interval overlap queries.
	    Seemingly, in this case a redundant policy - a policy which
	    doesn't affect nodes' contents would suffice. This, would lead
	    to the following drawbacks:</para>

	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem><para>Each node would carry a useless metadata object, wasting
	      space.</para></listitem>

	      <listitem><para>The tree cannot know if its
	      <classname>Node_Update</classname> policy actually modifies a
	      node's metadata (this is halting reducible). In the graphic
	      below, assume the shaded node is inserted. The tree would have
	      to traverse the useless path shown to the root, applying
	      redundant updates all the way.</para></listitem>

	  <para>A trie inherently views its keys as sequences of elements.
	  For example, a trie can view a string as a sequence of
	  characters. A trie needs to map each of n elements to a
	  number in {0, n - 1}. For example, a trie can map a
	  character <varname>c</varname> to
	  <programlisting>static_cast&lt;size_t&gt;(c)</programlisting>.</para>

	  <para>Seemingly, then, a trie can assume that its keys support
	  (const) iterators, and that the <classname>value_type</classname> of this
	  iterator can be cast to a <classname>size_t</classname>. There are several
	  reasons, though, to decouple the mechanism by which the trie
	  accesses its keys' elements from the trie:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem><para>In some cases, the numerical value of an element is
	    inappropriate. Consider a trie storing DNA strings. It is
	    logical to use a trie with a fan-out of 5 = 1 + |{'A', 'C',
	    'G', 'T'}|. This requires mapping 'T' to 3, though.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>In some cases the keys' iterators are different than what
	    is needed. For example, a trie can be used to search for
	    common suffixes, by using strings'
	    <classname>reverse_iterator</classname>. As another example, a trie mapping
	    UNICODE strings would have a huge fan-out if each node would
	    branch on a UNICODE character; instead, one can define an
	    iterator iterating over 8-bit (or less) groups.</para></listitem>
	  </orderedlist>

	  <para>trie is,
	  consequently, parametrized by <classname>E_Access_Traits</classname> -
	  traits which instruct how to access sequences' elements.
	  <classname>string_trie_e_access_traits</classname>
	  is a traits class for strings. Each such traits define some
	  types, like:</para>
	  <programlisting>
	    typename E_Access_Traits::const_iterator
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>is a const iterator iterating over a key's elements. The
	  traits class must also define methods for obtaining an iterator
	  to the first and last element of a key.</para>

	  <para>The graphic below shows a
	  (PATRICIA) trie resulting from inserting the words: "I wish
	  that I could ever see a poem lovely as a trie" (which,
	  unfortunately, does not rhyme).</para>

	  <para>The leaf nodes contain values; each internal node contains
	  two <classname>typename E_Access_Traits::const_iterator</classname>
	  objects, indicating the maximal common prefix of all keys in
	  the sub-tree. For example, the shaded internal node roots a
	  sub-tree with leafs "a" and "as". The maximal common prefix is
	  "a". The internal node contains, consequently, to const
	  iterators, one pointing to <varname>'a'</varname>, and the other to
	  <varname>'s'</varname>.</para>

	<para>A list-based associative container is a container that
	stores elements in a linked-list. It does not order the elements

	containers are primarily useful for creating "multimaps". In fact,
	list-based containers are designed in this library expressly for
	this purpose.</para>

	<para>List-based containers might also be useful for some rare
	cases, where a key is encapsulated to the extent that only
	key-equivalence can be tested. Hash-based containers need to know

	  <para>this library allows instantiating lists with policies

	  unsupported).</para>

	  <para>Associative containers based on lists are parametrized by a
	  <classname>Update_Policy</classname> parameter. This parameter defines the
	  type of metadata each node contains, how to create the
	  metadata, and how to decide, using this metadata, whether to
	  move a node to the front of the list. A list-based associative
	  container object derives (publicly) from its update policy.
	  </para>

	  <para>An instantiation of <classname>Update_Policy</classname> must define
	  internally <classname>update_metadata</classname> as the metadata it
	  requires. Internally, each node of the list contains, besides
	  the usual key and data, an instance of <classname>typename
	  Update_Policy::update_metadata</classname>.</para>

	  <para>An instantiation of <classname>Update_Policy</classname> must define
	  internally two operators:</para>
	  <programlisting>
	    update_metadata
	    operator()();

	    bool
	    operator()(update_metadata &amp;);
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>The first is called by the container object, when creating a
	  new node, to create the node's metadata. The second is called
	  by the container object, when a node is accessed (
	  when a find operation's key is equivalent to the key of the
	  node), to determine whether to move the node to the front of
	  the list.
	  </para>

	  <para>The library contains two predefined implementations of
	  list-update policies. The first
	  is <classname>lu_counter_policy</classname>, which implements the
	  counter algorithm described above. The second is
	  <classname>lu_move_to_front_policy</classname>,
	  which unconditionally move an accessed element to the front of

	<info><title>Details</title></info>

	<section xml:id="container.priority_queue.details.iterators">
	  <info><title>Iterators</title></info>

	  <para>There are many different underlying-data structures for
	  implementing priority queues. Unfortunately, most such
	  structures are oriented towards making <function>push</function> and
	  <function>top</function> efficient, and consequently don't allow efficient
	  access of other elements: for instance, they cannot support an efficient
	  <function>find</function> method. In the use case where it
	  is important to both access and "do something with" an
	  arbitrary value, one would be out of luck. For example, many graph algorithms require
	  modifying a value (typically increasing it in the sense of the
	  priority queue's comparison functor).</para>

	  <para>In order to access and manipulate an arbitrary value in a
	  priority queue, one needs to reference the internals of the
	  priority queue from some form of an associative container -
	  this is unavoidable. Of course, in order to maintain the
	  encapsulation of the priority queue, this needs to be done in a
	  way that minimizes exposure to implementation internals.</para>

	  <para>In this library the priority queue's <function>insert</function>
	  method returns an iterator, which if valid can be used for subsequent <function>modify</function> and
	  <function>erase</function> operations. This both preserves the priority
	  queue's encapsulation, and allows accessing arbitrary values (since the
	  returned iterators from the <function>push</function> operation can be
	  stored in some form of associative container).</para>

	  <para>Priority queues' iterators present a problem regarding their
	  invalidation guarantees. One assumes that calling
	  <function>operator++</function> on an iterator will associate it
	  with the "next" value. Priority-queues are
	  self-organizing: each operation changes what the "next" value
	  means. Consequently, it does not make sense that <function>push</function>
	  will return an iterator that can be incremented - this can have
	  no possible use. Also, as in the case of hash-based containers,
	  it is awkward to define if a subsequent <function>push</function> operation
	  invalidates a prior returned iterator: it invalidates it in the
	  sense that its "next" value is not related to what it
	  previously considered to be its "next" value. However, it might not
	  invalidate it, in the sense that it can be
	  de-referenced and used for <function>modify</function> and <function>erase</function>
	  operations.</para>

	  <para>Similarly to the case of the other unordered associative
	  containers, this library uses a distinction between
	  point-type and range type iterators. A priority queue's <classname>iterator</classname> can always be
	  converted to a <classname>point_iterator</classname>, and a
	  <classname>const_iterator</classname> can always be converted to a
	  <classname>point_const_iterator</classname>.</para>

	  <para>The following snippet demonstrates manipulating an arbitrary
	  value:</para>
	  <programlisting>
	    // A priority queue of integers.
	    priority_queue&lt;int &gt; p;

	    // Insert some values into the priority queue.
	    priority_queue&lt;int &gt;::point_iterator it = p.push(0);

	    p.push(1);
	    p.push(2);

	    // Now modify a value.
	    p.modify(it, 3);

	    assert(p.top() == 3);
	  </programlisting>

	  
	  <para>It should be noted that an alternative design could embed an
	  associative container in a priority queue. Could, but most
	  probably should not. To begin with, it should be noted that one
	  could always encapsulate a priority queue and an associative
	  container mapping values to priority queue iterators with no
	  performance loss. One cannot, however, "un-encapsulate" a priority
	  queue embedding an associative container, which might lead to
	  performance loss. Assume, that one needs to associate each value
	  with some data unrelated to priority queues. Then using
	  this library's design, one could use an
	  associative container mapping each value to a pair consisting of
	  this data and a priority queue's iterator. Using the embedded
	  method would need to use two associative containers. Similar
	  problems might arise in cases where a value can reside
	  simultaneously in many priority queues.</para>

	  <info><title>Underlying Data Structure</title></info>

	  <para>There are three main implementations of priority queues: the
	  first employs a binary heap, typically one which uses a
	  sequence; the second uses a tree (or forest of trees), which is
	  typically less structured than an associative container's tree;
	  the third simply uses an associative container. These are
	  shown in the graphic below, in labels A1 and A2, label B, and label C.</para>

	  <para>Roughly speaking, any value that is both pushed and popped
	  from a priority queue must incur a logarithmic expense (in the
	  amortized sense). Any priority queue implementation that would
	  avoid this, would violate known bounds on comparison-based
	  sorting (see <xref linkend="biblio.clrs2001"/> and <xref linkend="biblio.brodal96priority"/>).
	  </para>

	  <para>Most implementations do
	  not differ in the asymptotic amortized complexity of
	  <function>push</function> and <function>pop</function> operations, but they differ in
	  the constants involved, in the complexity of other operations
	  (e.g., <function>modify</function>), and in the worst-case
	  complexity of single operations. In general, the more
	  "structured" an implementation (i.e., the more internal
	  invariants it possesses) - the higher its amortized complexity
	  of <function>push</function> and <function>pop</function> operations.</para>

	  <para>This library implements different algorithms using a
	  single class: <classname>priority_queue</classname>.
	  Instantiating the <classname>Tag</classname> template parameter, "selects"
	  the implementation:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem><para>
	      Instantiating <classname>Tag = binary_heap_tag</classname> creates
	      a binary heap of the form in represented in the graphic with labels A1 or A2. The former is internally
	      selected by priority_queue
	      if <classname>Value_Type</classname> is instantiated by a primitive type
	      (e.g., an <type>int</type>); the latter is
	      internally selected for all other types (e.g.,
	      <classname>std::string</classname>). This implementations is relatively
	      unstructured, and so has good <classname>push</classname> and <classname>pop</classname>
	      performance; it is the "best-in-kind" for primitive
	      types, e.g., <type>int</type>s. Conversely, it has
	      high worst-case performance, and can support only linear-time
	    <function>modify</function> and <function>erase</function> operations.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>Instantiating <classname>Tag =
	    pairing_heap_tag</classname> creates a pairing heap of the form
	    in represented by label B in the graphic above. This
	    implementations too is relatively unstructured, and so has good
	    <function>push</function> and <function>pop</function>
	    performance; it is the "best-in-kind" for non-primitive types,
	    e.g., <classname>std:string</classname>s. It also has very good
	    worst-case <function>push</function> and
	    <function>join</function> performance (O(1)), but has high
	    worst-case <function>pop</function>
	    complexity.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>Instantiating <classname>Tag =
	    binomial_heap_tag</classname> creates a binomial heap of the
	    form repsented by label B in the graphic above. This
	    implementations is more structured than a pairing heap, and so
	    has worse <function>push</function> and <function>pop</function>
	    performance. Conversely, it has sub-linear worst-case bounds for
	    <function>pop</function>, e.g., and so it might be preferred in
	    cases where responsiveness is important.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>Instantiating <classname>Tag =
	    rc_binomial_heap_tag</classname> creates a binomial heap of the
	    form represented in label B above, accompanied by a redundant
	    counter which governs the trees. This implementations is
	    therefore more structured than a binomial heap, and so has worse
	    <function>push</function> and <function>pop</function>
	    performance. Conversely, it guarantees O(1)
	    <function>push</function> complexity, and so it might be
	    preferred in cases where the responsiveness of a binomial heap
	    is insufficient.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>Instantiating <classname>Tag =
	    thin_heap_tag</classname> creates a thin heap of the form
	    represented by the label B in the graphic above. This
	    implementations too is more structured than a pairing heap, and
	    so has worse <function>push</function> and
	    <function>pop</function> performance. Conversely, it has better
	    worst-case and identical amortized complexities than a Fibonacci
	    heap, and so might be more appropriate for some graph
	    algorithms.</para></listitem>
	  </orderedlist>

	  <para>Of course, one can use any order-preserving associative
	  container as a priority queue, as in the graphic above label C, possibly by creating an adapter class
	  over the associative container (much as 
	  <classname>std::priority_queue</classname> can adapt <classname>std::vector</classname>).
	  This has the advantage that no cross-referencing is necessary
	  at all; the priority queue itself is an associative container.
	  Most associative containers are too structured to compete with
	  priority queues in terms of <function>push</function> and <function>pop</function>
	  performance.</para>

	<section xml:id="container.priority_queue.details.traits">
	  <info><title>Traits</title></info>

	  <para>It would be nice if all priority queues could
	  share exactly the same behavior regardless of implementation. Sadly, this is not possible. Just one for instance is in join operations: joining
	  two binary heaps might throw an exception (not corrupt
	  any of the heaps on which it operates), but joining two pairing
	  heaps is exception free.</para>

	  <para>Tags and traits are very useful for manipulating generic
	  types. <classname>__gnu_pbds::priority_queue</classname>
	  publicly defines <classname>container_category</classname> as one of the tags. Given any
	  container <classname>Cntnr</classname>, the tag of the underlying
	  data structure can be found via <classname>typename 
	  Cntnr::container_category</classname>; this is one of the possible tags shown in the graphic below.

	  </figure>


	  <para>Additionally, a traits mechanism can be used to query a
	  container type for its attributes. Given any container
	  <classname>Cntnr</classname>, then <programlisting>__gnu_pbds::container_traits&lt;Cntnr&gt;</programlisting>
	  is a traits class identifying the properties of the
	  container.</para>

	  <para>To find if a container might throw if two of its objects are
	  joined, one can use 
	  <programlisting>
	    container_traits&lt;Cntnr&gt;::split_join_can_throw
	  </programlisting>
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    Different priority-queue implementations have different invalidation guarantees. This is
	    especially important, since there is no way to access an arbitrary
	    value of priority queues except for iterators. Similarly to
	    associative containers, one can use
	    <programlisting>
	      container_traits&lt;Cntnr&gt;::invalidation_guarantee
	    </programlisting>
	  to get the invalidation guarantee type of a priority queue.</para>

	  <para>It is easy to understand from the graphic above, what <classname>container_traits&lt;Cntnr&gt;::invalidation_guarantee</classname>
	  will be for different implementations. All implementations of
	  type represented by label B have <classname>point_invalidation_guarantee</classname>:
	  the container can freely internally reorganize the nodes -
	  range-type iterators are invalidated, but point-type iterators
	  are always valid. Implementations of type represented by labels A1 and A2 have <classname>basic_invalidation_guarantee</classname>:
	  the container can freely internally reallocate the array - both
	  point-type and range-type iterators might be invalidated.</para>

	  <para>
	    This has major implications, and constitutes a good reason to avoid
	    using binary heaps. A binary heap can perform <function>modify</function>
	    or <function>erase</function> efficiently given a valid point-type
	    iterator. However, in order to supply it with a valid point-type
	    iterator, one needs to iterate (linearly) over all
	    values, then supply the relevant iterator (recall that a
	    range-type iterator can always be converted to a point-type
	    iterator). This means that if the number of <function>modify</function> or
	    <function>erase</function> operations is non-negligible (say
	    super-logarithmic in the total sequence of operations) - binary
	    heaps will perform badly.
