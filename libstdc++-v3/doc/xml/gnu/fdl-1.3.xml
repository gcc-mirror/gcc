    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    0. PREAMBLE
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom:
    to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
    or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
    publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
    responsible for modifications made by others.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
    sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
    should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
    does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
    for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
    published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section1" renderas="sect2">
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”, below,
    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
    and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy,
    modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under
    copyright law.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing
    the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
    the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
    does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to
    be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant
    Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then
    there are none.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable
    copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is
    not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is
    not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
    without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
    using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
    material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page”
    means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s
    title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes
    copies of the Document to the public.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
    whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
    following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
    for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
    “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”,
    “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve
    the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that
    it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this
    definition.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section2" renderas="sect2">
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
    may publicly display copies.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section3" renderas="sect2">
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
    back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
    you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
    actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section4" renderas="sect2">
    4. MODIFICATIONS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
    conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
    Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
    filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
  </simpara>
  <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
        from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
        should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
        Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
        original publisher of that version gives permission.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
        responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
        Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
        Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
        unless they release you from this requirement.

        Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its
        Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
        authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
        Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
        Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher
        of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
        describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.

    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
        public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
        network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
        based on.  These may be placed in the “History”
        section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
        at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
        publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or
        “Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and
        preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
        contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
        their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
        not considered part of the section titles.

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled

        Section.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <simpara>
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
    that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
    Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
    as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
    Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties — for example, statements of peer review or that the text
    has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
    Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
    and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
    by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
    same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
    that added the old one.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
    permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
    endorsement of any Modified Version.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section5" renderas="sect2">
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
    provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
    of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
    Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
    you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
    identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
    are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
    make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
    parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
    if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
    combined work.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
    “History” in the various original documents, forming one
    section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections
    Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled
    “Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled
    “Endorsements”.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section6" renderas="sect2">
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
    respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section7" renderas="sect2">
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
    independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of
    the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works
    permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
    not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
    of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
    aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear
    on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section8" renderas="sect2">
    8. TRANSLATION
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
    translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
    Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
    their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
    Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
    Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
    license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
    that you also include the original English version of this License and the
    original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
    disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
    License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
    “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement
    (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
    changing the actual title.
  </simpara>
  <bridgehead xml:id="fdl-1-section9" renderas="sect2">
    9. TERMINATION
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
    and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
    license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
    of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
    cessation.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
    you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not
    give you any rights to use it.

    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
    Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns. See
    <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">Copyleft</link>.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
    the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
    “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of
    any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft)
    by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy
    can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
    proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
    authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

    11. RELICENSING
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC
    Site”) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable
    works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
    works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a
    server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or
    “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable
    works thus published on the MMC site.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike
    3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published
    by that same organization.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in
    whole or in part, as part of another Document.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under
    this License, and if all works that were first published under this
    License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in
    whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant
    sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
  </bridgehead>
  <simpara>
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the

    replace the “with… Texts.” line with this:
  </simpara>
  <screen>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts
being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</screen>
  <simpara>
    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.
