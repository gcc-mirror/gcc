    </p><p> The libstdc++ debug mode replaces unsafe (but efficient) standard
  containers and iterators with semantically equivalent safe standard
  containers and iterators to aid in debugging user programs. The
  following goals directed the design of the libstdc++ debug mode:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Correctness</em></span>: the libstdc++ debug mode must not change
    the semantics of the standard library for all cases specified in
    the ANSI/ISO C++ standard. The essence of this constraint is that
    any valid C++ program should behave in the same manner regardless
    of whether it is compiled with debug mode or release mode. In
    particular, entities that are defined in namespace std in release
    mode should remain defined in namespace std in debug mode, so that
    legal specializations of namespace std entities will remain
    valid. A program that is not valid C++ (e.g., invokes undefined
    behavior) is not required to behave similarly, although the debug
    mode will abort with a diagnostic when it detects undefined
    behavior.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Performance</em></span>: the additional of the libstdc++ debug mode
    must not affect the performance of the library when it is compiled
    in release mode. Performance of the libstdc++ debug mode is
    secondary (and, in fact, will be worse than the release
    mode).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Usability</em></span>: the libstdc++ debug mode should be easy to
    use. It should be easily incorporated into the user's development
    environment (e.g., by requiring only a single new compiler switch)
    and should produce reasonable diagnostics when it detects a
    problem with the user program. Usability also involves detection
    of errors when using the debug mode incorrectly, e.g., by linking
    a release-compiled object against a debug-compiled object if in
    fact the resulting program will not run correctly.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Minimize recompilation</em></span>: While it is expected that
    users recompile at least part of their program to use debug
    mode, the amount of recompilation affects the
    detect-compile-debug turnaround time. This indirectly affects the
    usefulness of the debug mode, because debugging some applications
    may require rebuilding a large amount of code, which may not be
    feasible when the suspect code may be very localized. There are
    several levels of conformance to this requirement, each with its
    own usability and implementation characteristics. In general, the
    higher-numbered conformance levels are more usable (i.e., require
    less recompilation) but are more complicated to implement than
    the lower-numbered conformance levels.
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Full recompilation</em></span>: The user must recompile his or
	her entire application and all C++ libraries it depends on,
	including the C++ standard library that ships with the
	compiler. This must be done even if only a small part of the
	program can use debugging features.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Full user recompilation</em></span>: The user must recompile
	his or her entire application and all C++ libraries it depends
	on, but not the C++ standard library itself. This must be done
	even if only a small part of the program can use debugging
	features. This can be achieved given a full recompilation
	system by compiling two versions of the standard library when
	the compiler is installed and linking against the appropriate
	one, e.g., a multilibs approach.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Partial recompilation</em></span>: The user must recompile the
	parts of his or her application and the C++ libraries it
	depends on that will use the debugging facilities
	directly. This means that any code that uses the debuggable
	standard containers would need to be recompiled, but code
	that does not use them (but may, for instance, use IOStreams)
	would not have to be recompiled.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Per-use recompilation</em></span>: The user must recompile the
	parts of his or her application and the C++ libraries it
	depends on where debugging should occur, and any other code
	that interacts with those containers. This means that a set of
	translation units that accesses a particular standard
	container instance may either be compiled in release mode (no
	checking) or debug mode (full checking), but must all be
	compiled in the same way; a translation unit that does not see
	that standard container instance need not be recompiled. This
	also means that a translation unit <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> that contains a
	particular instantiation
	(say, <code class="code">std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code>) compiled in release
	mode can be linked against a translation unit <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span> that
	contains the same instantiation compiled in debug mode (a
	feature not present with partial recompilation). While this
	behavior is technically a violation of the One Definition
	Rule, this ability tends to be very important in
	practice. The libstdc++ debug mode supports this level of
	recompilation. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Per-unit recompilation</em></span>: The user must only
	recompile the translation units where checking should occur,
	regardless of where debuggable standard containers are
	used. This has also been dubbed "<code class="code">-g</code> mode",
	because the <code class="code">-g</code> compiler switch works in this way,
	emitting debugging information at a per--translation-unit
	granularity. We believe that this level of recompilation is in
	fact not possible if we intend to supply safe iterators, leave
	the program semantics unchanged, and not regress in
	performance under release mode because we cannot associate
	extra information with an iterator (to form a safe iterator)
	without either reserving that space in release mode
	(performance regression) or allocating extra memory associated
	with each iterator with <code class="code">new</code> (changes the program
	semantics).</p></li></ol></div><p>

    </p><p>This section provides an overall view of the design of the
  libstdc++ debug mode and details the relationship between design
  decisions and the stated design goals.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="debug_mode.design.methods.wrappers"></a>The Wrapper Model</h4></div></div></div><p>The libstdc++ debug mode uses a wrapper model where the
  debugging versions of library components (e.g., iterators and
  containers) form a layer on top of the release versions of the
  library components. The debugging components first verify that the
  operation is correct (aborting with a diagnostic if an error is
  found) and will then forward to the underlying release-mode
  container that will perform the actual work. This design decision
  ensures that we cannot regress release-mode performance (because the
  release-mode containers are left untouched) and partially
  enables <a class="link" href="debug_mode_design.html#methods.coexistence.link" title="Link- and run-time coexistence of release- and debug-mode components">mixing debug and
  release code</a> at link time, although that will not be
  discussed at this time.</p><p>Two types of wrappers are used in the implementation of the debug
  mode: container wrappers and iterator wrappers. The two types of
  wrappers interact to maintain relationships between iterators and
  their associated containers, which are necessary to detect certain
  types of standard library usage errors such as dereferencing
  past-the-end iterators or inserting into a container using an
  iterator from a different container.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="debug_mode.design.methods.safe_iter"></a>Safe Iterators</h5></div></div></div><p>Iterator wrappers provide a debugging layer over any iterator that
  is attached to a particular container, and will manage the
  information detailing the iterator's state (singular,
  dereferenceable, etc.) and tracking the container to which the
  iterator is attached. Because iterators have a well-defined, common
  interface the iterator wrapper is implemented with the iterator
  adaptor class template <code class="code">__gnu_debug::_Safe_iterator</code>,
  which takes two template parameters:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">Iterator</code>: The underlying iterator type, which must
    be either the <code class="code">iterator</code> or <code class="code">const_iterator</code>
    typedef from the sequence type this iterator can reference.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">Sequence</code>: The type of sequence that this iterator
  references. This sequence must be a safe sequence (discussed below)
  whose <code class="code">iterator</code> or <code class="code">const_iterator</code> typedef
  is the type of the safe iterator.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="debug_mode.design.methods.safe_seq"></a>Safe Sequences (Containers)</h5></div></div></div><p>Container wrappers provide a debugging layer over a particular
  container type. Because containers vary greatly in the member
  functions they support and the semantics of those member functions
  (especially in the area of iterator invalidation), container
  wrappers are tailored to the container they reference, e.g., the
  debugging version of <code class="code">std::list</code> duplicates the entire
  interface of <code class="code">std::list</code>, adding additional semantic
  checks and then forwarding operations to the
  real <code class="code">std::list</code> (a public base class of the debugging
  version) as appropriate. However, all safe containers inherit from
  the class template <code class="code">__gnu_debug::_Safe_sequence</code>,
  instantiated with the type of the safe container itself (an instance
  of the curiously recurring template pattern).</p><p>The iterators of a container wrapper will be
  <a class="link" href="debug_mode_design.html#debug_mode.design.methods.safe_iter" title="Safe Iterators">safe
  iterators</a> that reference sequences of this type and wrap the
  iterators provided by the release-mode base class. The debugging
  container will use only the safe iterators within its own interface
  (therefore requiring the user to use safe iterators, although this
  does not change correct user code) and will communicate with the
  release-mode base class with only the underlying, unsafe,
  release-mode iterators that the base class exports.</p><p> The debugging version of <code class="code">std::list</code> will have the
  following basic structure:</p><pre class="programlisting">
template&lt;typename _Tp, typename _Allocator = allocator&lt;_Tp&gt;
  class debug-list :
    public release-list&lt;_Tp, _Allocator&gt;,
    public __gnu_debug::_Safe_sequence&lt;debug-list&lt;_Tp, _Allocator&gt; &gt;
  {
    typedef release-list&lt;_Tp, _Allocator&gt; _Base;
    typedef debug-list&lt;_Tp, _Allocator&gt;   _Self;

  public:
    typedef __gnu_debug::_Safe_iterator&lt;typename _Base::iterator, _Self&gt;       iterator;
    typedef __gnu_debug::_Safe_iterator&lt;typename _Base::const_iterator, _Self&gt; const_iterator;

    // duplicate std::list interface with debugging semantics
  };
</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="debug_mode.design.methods.precond"></a>Precondition Checking</h4></div></div></div><p>The debug mode operates primarily by checking the preconditions of
  all standard library operations that it supports. Preconditions that
  are always checked (regardless of whether or not we are in debug
  mode) are checked via the <code class="code">__check_xxx</code> macros defined
  and documented in the source
  file <code class="code">include/debug/debug.h</code>. Preconditions that may or
  may not be checked, depending on the debug-mode
  macro <code class="code">_GLIBCXX_DEBUG</code>, are checked via
  the <code class="code">__requires_xxx</code> macros defined and documented in the
  same source file. Preconditions are validated using any additional
  information available at run-time, e.g., the containers that are
  associated with a particular iterator, the position of the iterator
  within those containers, the distance between two iterators that may
  form a valid range, etc. In the absence of suitable information,
  e.g., an input iterator that is not a safe iterator, these
  precondition checks will silently succeed.</p><p>The majority of precondition checks use the aforementioned macros,
  which have the secondary benefit of having prewritten debug
  messages that use information about the current status of the
  objects involved (e.g., whether an iterator is singular or what
  sequence it is attached to) along with some static information
  (e.g., the names of the function parameters corresponding to the
  objects involved). When not using these macros, the debug mode uses
  either the debug-mode assertion
  macro <code class="code">_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_ASSERT</code> , its pedantic
  cousin <code class="code">_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDASSERT</code>, or the assertion
  check macro that supports more advance formulation of error
  messages, <code class="code">_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_VERIFY</code>. These macros are
  documented more thoroughly in the debug mode source code.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="debug_mode.design.methods.coexistence"></a>Release- and debug-mode coexistence</h4></div></div></div><p>The libstdc++ debug mode is the first debug mode we know of that
  is able to provide the "Per-use recompilation" (4) guarantee, that
  allows release-compiled and debug-compiled code to be linked and
  executed together without causing unpredictable behavior. This
  guarantee minimizes the recompilation that users are required to
  perform, shortening the detect-compile-debug bug hunting cycle
  and making the debug mode easier to incorporate into development
  environments by minimizing dependencies.</p><p>Achieving link- and run-time coexistence is not a trivial
  implementation task. To achieve this goal we use inline namespaces and
  a complex organization of debug- and release-modes. The end result is
  that we have achieved per-use recompilation but have had to give up
  some checking of the <code class="code">std::basic_string</code> class template
  (namely, safe iterators).</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="methods.coexistence.compile"></a>Compile-time coexistence of release- and debug-mode components</h5></div></div></div><p>Both the release-mode components and the debug-mode
  components need to exist within a single translation unit so that
  the debug versions can wrap the release versions. However, only one
  of these components should be user-visible at any particular
  time with the standard name, e.g., <code class="code">std::list</code>. </p><p>In release mode, we define only the release-mode version of the
  component with its standard name and do not include the debugging
  component at all. The release mode version is defined within the
  namespace <code class="code">std</code>. Minus the namespace associations, this
  method leaves the behavior of release mode completely unchanged from
  its behavior prior to the introduction of the libstdc++ debug
  mode. Here's an example of what this ends up looking like, in
  C++.</p><pre class="programlisting">
namespace std
{
  template&lt;typename _Tp, typename _Alloc = allocator&lt;_Tp&gt; &gt;
    class list
    {
      // ...
     };
} // namespace std
</pre><p>In debug mode we include the release-mode container (which is now
defined in the namespace <code class="code">__cxx1998</code>) and also the
debug-mode container. The debug-mode container is defined within the
namespace <code class="code">__debug</code>, which is associated with namespace
<code class="code">std</code> via the C++11 namespace association language feature.  This
method allows the debug and release versions of the same component to
coexist at compile-time and link-time without causing an unreasonable
maintenance burden, while minimizing confusion. Again, this boils down
to C++ code as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
namespace std
{
  namespace __cxx1998
  {
    template&lt;typename _Tp, typename _Alloc = allocator&lt;_Tp&gt; &gt;
      class list
      {
	// ...
      };
  } // namespace __gnu_norm

  namespace __debug
  {
    template&lt;typename _Tp, typename _Alloc = allocator&lt;_Tp&gt; &gt;
      class list
      : public __cxx1998::list&lt;_Tp, _Alloc&gt;,
	public __gnu_debug::_Safe_sequence&lt;list&lt;_Tp, _Alloc&gt; &gt;
      {
	// ...
      };
  } // namespace __cxx1998

  inline namespace __debug { }
}
</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="methods.coexistence.link"></a>Link- and run-time coexistence of release- and
    debug-mode components</h5></div></div></div><p>Because each component has a distinct and separate release and
debug implementation, there is no issue with link-time
coexistence: the separate namespaces result in different mangled
names, and thus unique linkage.</p><p>However, components that are defined and used within the C++
standard library itself face additional constraints. For instance,
some of the member functions of <code class="code"> std::moneypunct</code> return
<code class="code">std::basic_string</code>. Normally, this is not a problem, but
with a mixed mode standard library that could be using either
debug-mode or release-mode <code class="code"> basic_string</code> objects, things
get more complicated.  As the return value of a function is not
encoded into the mangled name, there is no way to specify a
release-mode or a debug-mode string. In practice, this results in
runtime errors. A simplified example of this problem is as follows.
</p><p> Take this translation unit, compiled in debug-mode: </p><pre class="programlisting">
// -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG
#include &lt;string&gt;

std::string test02();

std::string test01()
{
  return test02();
}

int main()
{
  test01();
  return 0;
}
</pre><p> ... and linked to this translation unit, compiled in release mode:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;string&gt;

std::string
test02()
{
  return std::string("toast");
}
</pre><p> For this reason we cannot easily provide safe iterators for
  the <code class="code">std::basic_string</code> class template, as it is present
  throughout the C++ standard library. For instance, locale facets
  define typedefs that include <code class="code">basic_string</code>: in a mixed
  debug/release program, should that typedef be based on the
  debug-mode <code class="code">basic_string</code> or the
  release-mode <code class="code">basic_string</code>? While the answer could be
  "both", and the difference hidden via renaming a la the
  debug/release containers, we must note two things about locale
  facets:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>They exist as shared state: one can create a facet in one
  translation unit and access the facet via the same type name in a
  different translation unit. This means that we cannot have two
  different versions of locale facets, because the types would not be
  the same across debug/release-mode translation unit barriers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They have virtual functions returning strings: these functions
  mangle in the same way regardless of the mangling of their return
  types (see above), and their precise signatures can be relied upon
  by users because they may be overridden in derived classes.</p></li></ol></div><p>With the design of libstdc++ debug mode, we cannot effectively hide
  the differences between debug and release-mode strings from the
  user. Failure to hide the differences may result in unpredictable
  behavior, and for this reason we have opted to only
  perform <code class="code">basic_string</code> changes that do not require ABI
  changes. The effect on users is expected to be minimal, as there are
  simple alternatives (e.g., <code class="code">__gnu_debug::basic_string</code>),
  and the usability benefit we gain from the ability to mix debug- and
  release-compiled translation units is enormous.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="methods.coexistence.alt"></a>Alternatives for Coexistence</h5></div></div></div><p>The coexistence scheme above was chosen over many alternatives,
  including language-only solutions and solutions that also required
  extensions to the C++ front end. The following is a partial list of
  solutions, with justifications for our rejection of each.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Completely separate debug/release libraries</em></span>: This is by
  far the simplest implementation option, where we do not allow any
  coexistence of debug- and release-compiled translation units in a
  program. This solution has an extreme negative affect on usability,
  because it is quite likely that some libraries an application
  depends on cannot be recompiled easily. This would not meet
  our <span class="emphasis"><em>usability</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>minimize recompilation</em></span> criteria
  well.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Add a <code class="code">Debug</code> boolean template parameter</em></span>:
  Partial specialization could be used to select the debug

  default <code class="code">Debug</code> argument is <code class="code">true</code>
  or <code class="code">false</code>. This option would break conformance with the
  C++ standard in both debug <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> release modes. This would
  not meet our <span class="emphasis"><em>correctness</em></span> criteria. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Packaging a debug flag in the allocators</em></span>: We could

    the <code class="code">debug&lt;&gt;</code> allocator wrapper in a partial
    specialization. However, this has two drawbacks: first, there is a
    conformance issue because the default allocator would not be the
    standard-specified <code class="code">std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</code>. Secondly
    (and more importantly), users that specify allocators instead of

    this will solve some renaming problems and ensure that

  ramifications of the approach (as measured against the design goals
  for a libstdc++ debug mode) should be considered first. The DejaGNU

  wrapper model (that in some ways inspired the libstdc++ debug mode
  design), although at the time of this writing the debug mode is
  somewhat incomplete and meets only the "Full user recompilation" (2)
  recompilation guarantee by requiring the user to link against a
  different library in debug mode vs. release mode.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Metrowerks CodeWarrior: The C++ standard library
  that ships with Metrowerks CodeWarrior includes a debug mode. It is
  a full debug-mode implementation (including debugging for
  CodeWarrior extensions) and is easy to use, although it meets only
  the "Full recompilation" (1) recompilation
  guarantee.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="debug_mode_using.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="debug_mode.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="parallel_mode.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Using </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 18. Parallel Mode</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
