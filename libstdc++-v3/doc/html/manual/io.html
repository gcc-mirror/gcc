      only include the headers you really need.  Many people simply include
      &lt;iostream&gt; when they don't need to -- and that can <span class="emphasis"><em>penalize
      your runtime as well.</em></span>  Here are some tips on which header to use
      for which situations, starting with the simplest.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;iosfwd&gt;</em></span> should be included whenever you simply
      need the <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> of an I/O-related class, such as
      "ofstream" or "basic_streambuf".  Like the name
      implies, these are forward declarations.  (A word to all you fellow
      old school programmers:  trying to forward declare classes like
      "class istream;" won't work.  Look in the iosfwd header if
      you'd like to know why.)  For example,
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
    #include &lt;iosfwd&gt;

    class MyClass
    {
	....
	std::ifstream&amp;   input_file;
    };

    extern std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp;, MyClass&amp;);
   </pre><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;ios&gt;</em></span> declares the base classes for the entire
      I/O stream hierarchy, std::ios_base and std::basic_ios&lt;charT&gt;, the
      counting types std::streamoff and std::streamsize, the file
      positioning type std::fpos, and the various manipulators like
      std::hex, std::fixed, std::noshowbase, and so forth.
   </p><p>The ios_base class is what holds the format flags, the state flags,
      and the functions which change them (setf(), width(), precision(),
      etc).  You can also store extra data and register callback functions
      through ios_base, but that has been historically underused.  Anything
      which doesn't depend on the type of characters stored is consolidated
      here.
   </p><p>The template class basic_ios is the highest template class in the
      hierarchy; it is the first one depending on the character type, and
      holds all general state associated with that type:  the pointer to the
      polymorphic stream buffer, the facet information, etc.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;streambuf&gt;</em></span> declares the template class
      basic_streambuf, and two standard instantiations, streambuf and
      wstreambuf.  If you need to work with the vastly useful and capable
      stream buffer classes, e.g., to create a new form of storage
      transport, this header is the one to include.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;istream&gt;</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;ostream&gt;</em></span> are
      the headers to include when you are using the &gt;&gt;/&lt;&lt;
      interface, or any of the other abstract stream formatting functions.
      For example,
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
    #include &lt;istream&gt;

    std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; os, MyClass&amp; c)
    {
       return os &lt;&lt; c.data1() &lt;&lt; c.data2();
    }
   </pre><p>The std::istream and std::ostream classes are the abstract parents of
      the various concrete implementations.  If you are only using the
      interfaces, then you only need to use the appropriate interface header.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;iomanip&gt;</em></span> provides "extractors and inserters
      that alter information maintained by class ios_base and its derived
      classes," such as std::setprecision and std::setw.  If you need
      to write expressions like <code class="code">os &lt;&lt; setw(3);</code> or
      <code class="code">is &gt;&gt; setbase(8);</code>, you must include &lt;iomanip&gt;.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;sstream&gt;</em></span>/<span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;fstream&gt;</em></span>
      declare the six stringstream and fstream classes.  As they are the
      standard concrete descendants of istream and ostream, you will already
      know about them.
   </p><p>Finally, <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;iostream&gt;</em></span> provides the eight standard
      global objects (cin, cout, etc).  To do this correctly, this header
      also provides the contents of the &lt;istream&gt; and &lt;ostream&gt;
      headers, but nothing else.  The contents of this header look like
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
    #include &lt;ostream&gt;
    #include &lt;istream&gt;

    namespace std
    {
	extern istream cin;
	extern ostream cout;
	....

	// this is explained below
	<span class="emphasis"><em>static ios_base::Init __foo;</em></span>    // not its real name
    }
   </pre><p>Now, the runtime penalty mentioned previously:  the global objects
      must be initialized before any of your own code uses them; this is
      guaranteed by the standard.  Like any other global object, they must
      be initialized once and only once.  This is typically done with a
      construct like the one above, and the nested class ios_base::Init is
      specified in the standard for just this reason.
   </p><p>How does it work?  Because the header is included before any of your
      code, the <span class="emphasis"><em>__foo</em></span> object is constructed before any of
      your objects.  (Global objects are built in the order in which they
      are declared, and destroyed in reverse order.)  The first time the
      constructor runs, the eight stream objects are set up.
   </p><p>The <code class="code">static</code> keyword means that each object file compiled
      from a source file containing &lt;iostream&gt; will have its own
      private copy of <span class="emphasis"><em>__foo</em></span>.  There is no specified order
      of construction across object files (it's one of those pesky NP
      problems that make life so interesting), so one copy in each object
      file means that the stream objects are guaranteed to be set up before
      any of your code which uses them could run, thereby meeting the
      requirements of the standard.
   </p><p>The penalty, of course, is that after the first copy of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>__foo</em></span> is constructed, all the others are just wasted
      processor time.  The time spent is merely for an increment-and-test
      inside a function call, but over several dozen or hundreds of object
      files, that time can add up.  (It's not in a tight loop, either.)
   </p><p>The lesson?  Only include &lt;iostream&gt; when you need to use one of
      the standard objects in that source file; you'll pay less startup
      time.  Only include the header files you need to in general; your
      compile times will go down when there's less parsing work to do.
