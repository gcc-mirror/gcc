The static variables (pointers to freelists, tuning parameters etc)
are initialized as above, or are set to the global defaults.
</p><p>
The very first allocate() call will always call the
_S_initialize_once() function.  In order to make sure that this
function is called exactly once we make use of a __gthread_once call
in MT applications and check a static bool (_S_init) in ST
applications.
</p><p>
The _S_initialize() function:
- If the GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW environment variable is set, it sets the bool
  _S_force_new to true and then returns. This will cause subsequent calls to
  allocate() to return memory directly from a new() call, and deallocate will
  only do a delete() call.
</p><p>
- If the GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW environment variable is not set, both ST and MT
  applications will:
  - Calculate the number of bins needed. A bin is a specific power of two size
    of bytes. I.e., by default the allocator will deal with requests of up to
    128 bytes (or whatever the value of _S_max_bytes is when _S_init() is
    called). This means that there will be bins of the following sizes
    (in bytes): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

  - Create the _S_binmap array. All requests are rounded up to the next
    "large enough" bin. I.e., a request for 29 bytes will cause a block from
    the "32 byte bin" to be returned to the application. The purpose of
    _S_binmap is to speed up the process of finding out which bin to use.
    I.e., the value of _S_binmap[ 29 ] is initialized to 5 (bin 5 = 32 bytes).
</p><p>
  - Create the _S_bin array. This array consists of bin_records. There will be
    as many bin_records in this array as the number of bins that we calculated
    earlier. I.e., if _S_max_bytes = 128 there will be 8 entries.
    Each bin_record is then initialized:
    - bin_record-&gt;first = An array of pointers to block_records. There will be
      as many block_records pointers as there are maximum number of threads
      (in a ST application there is only 1 thread, in a MT application there
      are _S_max_threads).
      This holds the pointer to the first free block for each thread in this
      bin. I.e., if we would like to know where the first free block of size 32
      for thread number 3 is we would look this up by: _S_bin[ 5 ].first[ 3 ]

    The above created block_record pointers members are now initialized to
    their initial values. I.e. _S_bin[ n ].first[ n ] = NULL;
</p><p>
- Additionally a MT application will:
  - Create a list of free thread id's. The pointer to the first entry
    is stored in _S_thread_freelist_first. The reason for this approach is
    that the __gthread_self() call will not return a value that corresponds to
    the maximum number of threads allowed but rather a process id number or
    something else. So what we do is that we create a list of thread_records.
    This list is _S_max_threads long and each entry holds a size_t thread_id
    which is initialized to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on up to _S_max_threads.
    Each time a thread calls allocate() or deallocate() we call
    _S_get_thread_id() which looks at the value of _S_thread_key which is a
    thread local storage pointer. If this is NULL we know that this is a newly
    created thread and we pop the first entry from this list and saves the
    pointer to this record in the _S_thread_key variable. The next time
    we will get the pointer to the thread_record back and we use the
    thread_record-&gt;thread_id as identification. I.e., the first thread that
    calls allocate will get the first record in this list and thus be thread
    number 1 and will then find the pointer to its first free 32 byte block
    in _S_bin[ 5 ].first[ 1 ]
    When we create the _S_thread_key we also define a destructor
    (_S_thread_key_destr) which means that when the thread dies, this
    thread_record is returned to the front of this list and the thread id
    can then be reused if a new thread is created.
    This list is protected by a mutex (_S_thread_freelist_mutex) which is only
    locked when records are removed or added to the list.
</p><p>
  - Initialize the free and used counters of each bin_record:
    - bin_record-&gt;free = An array of size_t. This keeps track of the number
      of blocks on a specific thread's freelist in each bin. I.e., if a thread
      has 12 32-byte blocks on it's freelists and allocates one of these, this
      counter would be decreased to 11.

    - bin_record-&gt;used = An array of size_t. This keeps track of the number
      of blocks currently in use of this size by this thread. I.e., if a thread
      has made 678 requests (and no deallocations...) of 32-byte blocks this
      counter will read 678.

    The above created arrays are now initialized with their initial values.
    I.e. _S_bin[ n ].free[ n ] = 0;
</p><p>
  - Initialize the mutex of each bin_record: The bin_record-&gt;mutex
    is used to protect the global freelist. This concept of a global
    freelist is explained in more detail in the section "A multi
    threaded example", but basically this mutex is locked whenever a
    block of memory is retrieved or returned to the global freelist
    for this specific bin. This only occurs when a number of blocks
    are grabbed from the global list to a thread specific list or when
    a thread decides to return some blocks to the global freelist.

release memory back to the OS, but keeps its own freelists instead.
Because of this, memory debugging programs like
valgrind or purify may notice leaks: sorry about this
inconvenience. Operating systems will reclaim allocated memory at
program termination anyway. If sidestepping this kind of noise is
desired, there are three options: use an allocator, like
<code class="code">new_allocator</code> that releases memory while debugging, use
GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW to bypass the allocator's internal pools, or use a
custom pool datum that releases resources on destruction.
</p><p>
  On systems with the function <code class="code">__cxa_atexit</code>, the
allocator can be forced to free all memory allocated before program
termination with the member function
<code class="code">__pool_type::_M_destroy</code>. However, because this member
function relies on the precise and exactly-conforming ordering of
static destructors, including those of a static local
<code class="code">__pool</code> object, it should not be used, ever, on systems
that don't have the necessary underlying support. In addition, in
practice, forcing deallocation can be tricky, as it requires the
<code class="code">__pool</code> object to be fully-constructed before the object
that uses it is fully constructed. For most (but not all) STL
containers, this works, as an instance of the allocator is constructed
as part of a container's constructor. However, this assumption is
implementation-specific, and subject to change. For an example of a
pool that frees memory, see the following
