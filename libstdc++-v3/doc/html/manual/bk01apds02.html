	placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
	of this General Public License. The “<span class="quote">Program</span>”, below, refers to any such 
	program or work, and a 
	“<span class="quote">work based on the Program</span>” means either 
	the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
	work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
	modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
	is included without limitation in the term 
	“<span class="quote">modification</span>”.) Each licensee is addressed as “<span class="quote">you</span>”.</p><p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
	this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not 
	restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
	constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running 
	the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-1"></a>Section 1</h3></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
	publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
	keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
	warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
	along with the Program.</p><p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at 
	your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-2"></a>Section 2</h3></div></div></div><p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
	forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
	or work under the terms of 
	<a class="link" href="bk01apds02.html#gpl-2-1" title="Section 1">Section 1</a> above, provided 
	that you also meet all of these conditions:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
	      you changed the files and the date of any change.</p></li><li><p>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or 
	      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
	      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
	      this License.</p></li><li><p>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
	      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
	      ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
	      copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying 
	      that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
	      under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
	      License. (Exception: If the Program itself is interactive but does not 
              normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
              required to print an   announcement.)</p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
	of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
	independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, 
	do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when 
	you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the 
	Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
	permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and 
	every part regardless of who wrote it.</p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights 
	to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
	the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program 
	(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
	does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-3"></a>Section 3</h3></div></div></div><p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
	<a class="link" href="bk01apds02.html#gpl-2-2" title="Section 2">Section 2</a> in object code or executable form under the terms of 
	<a class="link" href="bk01apds02.html#gpl-2-1" title="Section 1">Sections 1</a> and 
	<a class="link" href="bk01apds02.html#gpl-2-2" title="Section 2">2</a> above provided that you also do one of the following:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
	      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
	      customarily used for software interchange; or,</p></li><li><p>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any 
	      third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source 
	      distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, 
	      to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily 
	      used for software interchange; or,</p></li><li><p>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
	      corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
	      distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form 
	      with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
	to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules 
	it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
	compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
	code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
	binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system 
	on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p><p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
	designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
	counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to 
	copy the source along with the object code.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-4"></a>Section 4</h3></div></div></div><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided 
	under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the 
	Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, 
	parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
	licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-5"></a>Section 5</h3></div></div></div><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing 
	else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
	These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying 
	or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
	of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
	modifying the Program or works based on it.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-6"></a>Section 6</h3></div></div></div><p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient 
	automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify 
	the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
	on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
	compliance by third parties to this License.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-7"></a>Section 7</h3></div></div></div><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other 
	reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
	agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you 
	from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
	your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
	you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
	royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or 
	indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
	to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, 
	the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply 
	in other circumstances.</p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property 
	right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
	protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public 
	license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
	distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up 
	to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
	system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the 
	rest of this License.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-8"></a>Section 8</h3></div></div></div><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents 
	or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
	distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
	incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-9"></a>Section 9</h3></div></div></div><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License 
	from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ 
	in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of 
	this License which applies to it and “<span class="quote">any later version</span>”, you have the option of following the terms 
	and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
	Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any 
	version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-10"></a>Section 10</h3></div></div></div><p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution 
	conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted 
	by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
	for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all 
	derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-11"></a>NO WARRANTY Section 11</h3></div></div></div><p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT 
	PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
	OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “<span class="quote">AS IS</span>” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
	INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
	PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE 
	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-2-12"></a>Section 12</h3></div></div></div><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR 
	ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
	FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE 
	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
	INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH 
	ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
	DAMAGES.</p><p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bk01apd.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="bk01apd.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bk01apds03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Appendix D. GNU General Public License </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../spine.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
