  In order to get our instrumented library version included instead of the
  release one,
  we use the same wrapper model as the debug mode.
  We subclass entities from the release version.  Wherever
  <code class="code">_GLIBCXX_PROFILE</code> is defined, the release namespace is
  <code class="code">std::__norm</code>, whereas the profile namespace is
  <code class="code">std::__profile</code>.  Using plain <code class="code">std</code> translates
  into <code class="code">std::__profile</code>.
  </p><p>
  Whenever possible, we try to wrap at the public interface level, e.g.,
  in <code class="code">unordered_set</code> rather than in <code class="code">hashtable</code>,
  in order not to depend on implementation.
  </p><p>
  Mixing object files built with and without the profile mode must
  not affect the program execution.  However, there are no guarantees to
  the accuracy of diagnostics when using even a single object not built with
  <code class="code">-D_GLIBCXX_PROFILE</code>.
  Currently, mixing the profile mode with debug and parallel extensions is
  not allowed.  Mixing them at compile time will result in preprocessor errors.
  Mixing them at link time is undefined.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.instrumentation"></a>Instrumentation</h3></div></div></div><p>
  Instead of instrumenting every public entry and exit point,
  we chose to add instrumentation on demand, as needed
  by individual diagnostics.
  The main reason is that some diagnostics require us to extract bits of
  internal state that are particular only to that diagnostic.
  We plan to formalize this later, after we learn more about the requirements
  of several diagnostics.
  </p><p>
  All the instrumentation points can be switched on and off using
  <code class="code">-D[_NO]_GLIBCXX_PROFILE_&lt;diagnostic&gt;</code> options.
  With all the instrumentation calls off, there should be negligible
  overhead over the release version.  This property is needed to support
  diagnostics based on timing of internal operations.  For such diagnostics,
  we anticipate turning most of the instrumentation off in order to prevent
  profiling overhead from polluting time measurements, and thus diagnostics.
  </p><p>
  All the instrumentation on/off compile time switches live in
  <code class="code">include/profile/profiler.h</code>.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.rtlib"></a>Run Time Behavior</h3></div></div></div><p>
  For practical reasons, the instrumentation library processes the trace
  partially
  rather than dumping it to disk in raw form.  Each event is processed when
  it occurs.  It is usually attached a cost and it is aggregated into
  the database of a specific diagnostic class.  The cost model
  is based largely on the standard performance guarantees, but in some
  cases we use knowledge about GCC's standard library implementation.
  </p><p>
  Information is indexed by (1) call stack and (2) instance id or address
  to be able to understand and summarize precise creation-use-destruction
  dynamic chains.  Although the analysis is sensitive to dynamic instances,
  the reports are only sensitive to call context.  Whenever a dynamic instance
  is destroyed, we accumulate its effect to the corresponding entry for the
  call stack of its constructor location.
  </p><p>

   <a class="link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CGO.2009.36" target="_top">paper presented at

  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.analysis"></a>Analysis and Diagnostics</h3></div></div></div><p>
  Final analysis takes place offline, and it is based entirely on the
  generated trace and debugging info in the application binary.
  See section Diagnostics for a list of analysis types that we plan to support.
  </p><p>
  The input to the analysis is a table indexed by profile type and call stack.
  The data type for each entry depends on the profile type.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.cost-model"></a>Cost Model</h3></div></div></div><p>
  While it is likely that cost models become complex as we get into
  more sophisticated analysis, we will try to follow a simple set of rules
  at the beginning.
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Relative benefit estimation:</em></span>
  The idea is to estimate or measure the cost of all operations
  in the original scenario versus the scenario we advise to switch to.
  For instance, when advising to change a vector to a list, an occurrence
  of the <code class="code">insert</code> method will generally count as a benefit.
  Its magnitude depends on (1) the number of elements that get shifted
  and (2) whether it triggers a reallocation.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Synthetic measurements:</em></span>
  We will measure the relative difference between similar operations on
  different containers.  We plan to write a battery of small tests that
  compare the times of the executions of similar methods on different
  containers.  The idea is to run these tests on the target machine.
  If this training phase is very quick, we may decide to perform it at
  library initialization time.  The results can be cached on disk and reused
  across runs.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Timers:</em></span>
  We plan to use timers for operations of larger granularity, such as sort.
  For instance, we can switch between different sort methods on the fly
  and report the one that performs best for each call context.
  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Show stoppers:</em></span>
  We may decide that the presence of an operation nullifies the advice.
  For instance, when considering switching from <code class="code">set</code> to
  <code class="code">unordered_set</code>, if we detect use of operator <code class="code">++</code>,
  we will simply not issue the advice, since this could signal that the use
  care require a sorted container.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.reports"></a>Reports</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are two types of reports.  First, if we recognize a pattern for which
we have a substitute that is likely to give better performance, we print
the advice and estimated performance gain.  The advice is usually associated
to a code position and possibly a call stack.
  </p><p>
Second, we report performance characteristics for which we do not have
a clear solution for improvement.  For instance, we can point to the user
the top 10 <code class="code">multimap</code> locations
which have the worst data locality in actual traversals.
Although this does not offer a solution,
it helps the user focus on the key problems and ignore the uninteresting ones.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.ext.profile_mode.design.testing"></a>Testing</h3></div></div></div><p>
  First, we want to make sure we preserve the behavior of the release mode.
  You can just type <code class="code">"make check-profile"</code>, which
  builds and runs the whole test suite in profile mode.
  </p><p>
  Second, we want to test the correctness of each diagnostic.
  We created a <code class="code">profile</code> directory in the test suite.
  Each diagnostic must come with at least two tests, one for false positives
  and one for false negatives.
