      standard does not address matters of multithreaded applications.
   </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.intro.using.concurrency.prereq"></a>Prerequisites</h3></div></div></div><p>All normal disclaimers aside, multithreaded C++ application are
      only supported when libstdc++ and all user code was built with
      compilers which report (via <code class="code"> gcc/g++ -v </code>) the same thread
      model and that model is not <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span>.  As long as your
      final application is actually single-threaded, then it should be
      safe to mix user code built with a thread model of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> with a libstdc++ and other C++ libraries built
      with another thread model useful on the platform.  Other mixes
      may or may not work but are not considered supported.  (Thus, if
      you distribute a shared C++ library in binary form only, it may
      be best to compile it with a GCC configured with
      --enable-threads for maximal interchangeability and usefulness
      with a user population that may have built GCC with either
      --enable-threads or --disable-threads.)
   </p><p>When you link a multithreaded application, you will probably
      need to add a library or flag to g++.  This is a very
      non-standardized area of GCC across ports.  Some ports support a
      special flag (the spelling isn't even standardized yet) to add
      all required macros to a compilation (if any such flags are
      required then you must provide the flag for all compilations not
      just linking) and link-library additions and/or replacements at
      link time.  The documentation is weak.  On several targets (including
      GNU/Linux, Solaris and various BSDs) -pthread is honored.
      Some other ports use other switches.
      This is not well documented anywhere other than
      in "gcc -dumpspecs" (look at the 'lib' and 'cpp' entries).
   </p><p>
     Some uses of <code class="classname">std::atomic</code> also require linking

In the terms of the 2011 C++ standard a thread-safe program is one which
does not perform any conflicting non-atomic operations on memory locations
and so does not contain any data races.
The standard places requirements on the library to ensure that no data
races are caused by the library itself or by programs which use the
library correctly (as described below).
The C++11 memory model and library requirements are a more formal version
of the <a class="link" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html" target="_top">SGI STL</a> definition of thread safety, which the library used
prior to the 2011 standard.
</p><p>The library strives to be thread-safe when all of the following
	 conditions are met:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The system's libc is itself thread-safe,
       </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	   The compiler in use reports a thread model other than
	   'single'. This can be tested via output from <code class="code">gcc
	   -v</code>. Multi-thread capable versions of gcc output
	   something like this:

         access any particular library object's state when one or more of
         those accesses modifies the state. An object will be modified by
         invoking a non-const member function on it or passing it as a
         non-const argument to a library function. An object will not be
         modified by invoking a const member function on it or passing it to
         a function as a pointer- or reference-to-const.
         Typically, the application
         programmer may infer what object locks must be held based on the
         objects referenced in a function call and whether the objects are
         accessed as const or non-const.  Without getting
	 into great detail, here is an example which requires user-level
	 locks:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
     library_class_a shared_object_a;

     void thread_main () {
       library_class_b *object_b = new library_class_b;
       shared_object_a.add_b (object_b);   // must hold lock for shared_object_a
       shared_object_a.mutate ();          // must hold lock for shared_object_a
     }

     // Multiple copies of thread_main() are started in independent threads.</pre><p>Under the assumption that object_a and object_b are never exposed to
	 another thread, here is an example that does not require any
	 user-level locks:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
     void thread_main () {
       library_class_a object_a;
       library_class_b *object_b = new library_class_b;
       object_a.add_b (object_b);
       object_a.mutate ();
     } </pre><p>All library types are safe to use in a multithreaded program
         if objects are not shared between threads or as
	 long each thread carefully locks out access by any other
	 thread while it modifies any object visible to another thread.
	 Unless otherwise documented, the only exceptions to these rules
         are atomic operations on the types in
         <code class="filename">&lt;atomic&gt;</code>
         and lock/unlock operations on the standard mutex types in
         <code class="filename">&lt;mutex&gt;</code>. These
         atomic operations allow concurrent accesses to the same object
         without introducing data races.
      </p><p>The following member functions of standard containers can be
         considered to be const for the purposes of avoiding data races:
         <code class="code">begin</code>, <code class="code">end</code>, <code class="code">rbegin</code>, <code class="code">rend</code>,
         <code class="code">front</code>, <code class="code">back</code>, <code class="code">data</code>,
         <code class="code">find</code>, <code class="code">lower_bound</code>, <code class="code">upper_bound</code>,
         <code class="code">equal_range</code>, <code class="code">at</code> 
         and, except in associative or unordered associative containers,
         <code class="code">operator[]</code>. In other words, although they are non-const
         so that they can return mutable iterators, those member functions
         will not modify the container.
         Accessing an iterator might cause a non-modifying access to
         the container the iterator refers to (for example incrementing a
         list iterator must access the pointers between nodes, which are part
         of the container and so conflict with other accesses to the container).
      </p><p>Programs which follow the rules above will not encounter data
         races in library code, even when using library types which share
         state between distinct objects.  In the example below the
         <code class="code">shared_ptr</code> objects share a reference count, but
         because the code does not perform any non-const operations on the
         globally-visible object, the library ensures that the reference
         count updates are atomic and do not introduce data races:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
    std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; global_sp;

    void thread_main() {
      auto local_sp = global_sp;  // OK, copy constructor's parameter is reference-to-const

      int i = *global_sp;         // OK, operator* is const
      int j = *local_sp;          // OK, does not operate on global_sp

      // *global_sp = 2;          // NOT OK, modifies int visible to other threads      
      // *local_sp = 2;           // NOT OK, modifies int visible to other threads      

      // global_sp.reset();       // NOT OK, reset is non-const
      local_sp.reset();           // OK, does not operate on global_sp
    }

    int main() {
      global_sp.reset(new int(1));
      std::thread t1(thread_main);
      std::thread t2(thread_main);
      t1.join();
      t2.join();
    }

    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.intro.using.concurrency.io"></a>IO</h3></div></div></div><p>This gets a bit tricky.  Please read carefully, and bear with me.
   </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.structure"></a>Structure</h4></div></div></div><p>A wrapper
      type called <code class="code">__basic_file</code> provides our abstraction layer
      for the <code class="code">std::filebuf</code> classes.  Nearly all decisions dealing
      with actual input and output must be made in <code class="code">__basic_file</code>.
   </p><p>A generic locking mechanism is somewhat in place at the filebuf layer,
      but is not used in the current code.  Providing locking at any higher
      level is akin to providing locking within containers, and is not done
      for the same reasons (see the links above).
   </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.defaults"></a>Defaults</h4></div></div></div><p>The __basic_file type is simply a collection of small wrappers around
      the C stdio layer (again, see the link under Structure).  We do no
      locking ourselves, but simply pass through to calls to <code class="code">fopen</code>,
      <code class="code">fwrite</code>, and so forth.
   </p><p>So, for 3.0, the question of "is multithreading safe for I/O"
      must be answered with, "is your platform's C library threadsafe
      for I/O?"  Some are by default, some are not; many offer multiple
      implementations of the C library with varying tradeoffs of threadsafety
      and efficiency.  You, the programmer, are always required to take care
      with multiple threads.
   </p><p>(As an example, the POSIX standard requires that C stdio FILE*
       operations are atomic.  POSIX-conforming C libraries (e.g, on Solaris
       and GNU/Linux) have an internal mutex to serialize operations on
       FILE*s.  However, you still need to not do stupid things like calling
       <code class="code">fclose(fs)</code> in one thread followed by an access of
       <code class="code">fs</code> in another.)
   </p><p>So, if your platform's C library is threadsafe, then your
      <code class="code">fstream</code> I/O operations will be threadsafe at the lowest
      level.  For higher-level operations, such as manipulating the data
      contained in the stream formatting classes (e.g., setting up callbacks
      inside an <code class="code">std::ofstream</code>), you need to guard such accesses
      like any other critical shared resource.
   </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.future"></a>Future</h4></div></div></div><p> A
      second choice may be available for I/O implementations:  libio.  This is
      disabled by default, and in fact will not currently work due to other
      issues.  It will be revisited, however.
   </p><p>The libio code is a subset of the guts of the GNU libc (glibc) I/O
      implementation.  When libio is in use, the <code class="code">__basic_file</code>
      type is basically derived from FILE.  (The real situation is more
      complex than that... it's derived from an internal type used to
      implement FILE.  See libio/libioP.h to see scary things done with
      vtbls.)  The result is that there is no "layer" of C stdio
      to go through; the filebuf makes calls directly into the same
      functions used to implement <code class="code">fread</code>, <code class="code">fwrite</code>,
      and so forth, using internal data structures.  (And when I say
      "makes calls directly," I mean the function is literally
      replaced by a jump into an internal function.  Fast but frightening.
      *grin*)
   </p><p>Also, the libio internal locks are used.  This requires pulling in
      large chunks of glibc, such as a pthreads implementation, and is one
      of the issues preventing widespread use of libio as the libstdc++
      cstdio implementation.
   </p><p>But we plan to make this work, at least as an option if not a future
      default.  Platforms running a copy of glibc with a recent-enough
      version will see calls from libstdc++ directly into the glibc already
      installed.  For other platforms, a copy of the libio subsection will
      be built and included in libstdc++.
   </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.alt"></a>Alternatives</h4></div></div></div><p>Don't forget that other cstdio implementations are possible.  You could
      easily write one to perform your own forms of locking, to solve your
      "interesting" problems.
   </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.intro.using.concurrency.containers"></a>Containers</h3></div></div></div><p>This section discusses issues surrounding the design of
      multithreaded applications which use Standard C++ containers.
      All information in this section is current as of the gcc 3.0
      release and all later point releases.  Although earlier gcc
      releases had a different approach to threading configuration and
      proper compilation, the basic code design rules presented here
      were similar.  For information on all other aspects of
      multithreading as it relates to libstdc++, including details on
      the proper compilation of threaded code (and compatibility between
      threaded and non-threaded code), see Chapter 17.
   </p><p>Two excellent pages to read when working with the Standard C++
      containers and threads are
      <a class="link" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html" target="_top">SGI's
      http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html</a> and
      <a class="link" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Allocators.html" target="_top">SGI's
      http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Allocators.html</a>.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>However, please ignore all discussions about the user-level
      configuration of the lock implementation inside the STL
      container-memory allocator on those pages.  For the sake of this
      discussion, libstdc++ configures the SGI STL implementation,
      not you.  This is quite different from how gcc pre-3.0 worked.
      In particular, past advice was for people using g++ to
      explicitly define _PTHREADS or other macros or port-specific
      compilation options on the command line to get a thread-safe
      STL.  This is no longer required for any port and should no
      longer be done unless you really know what you are doing and
      assume all responsibility.</em></span>
   </p><p>Since the container implementation of libstdc++ uses the SGI
      code, we use the same definition of thread safety as SGI when
      discussing design.  A key point that beginners may miss is the
      fourth major paragraph of the first page mentioned above
      (<span class="emphasis"><em>For most clients...</em></span>), which points out that
      locking must nearly always be done outside the container, by
      client code (that'd be you, not us).  There is a notable
      exceptions to this rule.  Allocators called while a container or
      element is constructed uses an internal lock obtained and
      released solely within libstdc++ code (in fact, this is the
      reason STL requires any knowledge of the thread configuration).
   </p><p>For implementing a container which does its own locking, it is
      trivial to provide a wrapper class which obtains the lock (as
      SGI suggests), performs the container operation, and then
      releases the lock.  This could be templatized <span class="emphasis"><em>to a certain
      extent</em></span>, on the underlying container and/or a locking
      mechanism.  Trying to provide a catch-all general template
      solution would probably be more trouble than it's worth.
   </p><p>The library implementation may be configured to use the
      high-speed caching memory allocator, which complicates thread
      safety issues. For all details about how to globally override
      this at application run-time
      see <a class="link" href="using_macros.html" title="Macros">here</a>. Also
