// This is a hack around not having either pre-compiled headers or
// export compilation. If defined, the io, string, and valarray
// headers will include all the necessary bits. If not defined, the
// implementation optimizes the headers for the most commonly-used
// types. For the io library, this means that larger, out-of-line
// member functions are only declared, and definitions are not parsed
// by the compiler, but instead instantiated into the library binary.

// In those parts of the standard C++ library that use a mutex instead
// of a spin-lock, we now unconditionally use GCC's gthr.h mutex
// abstraction layer.  All support to directly map to various
// threading models has been removed.  Note: gthr.h may well map to
// gthr-single.h which is a correct way to express no threads support
// in gcc.  Support for the undocumented _NOTHREADS has been removed.

// Default to the typically high-speed, pool-based allocator (as
// libstdc++-v2) instead of the malloc-based allocator (libstdc++-v3
// snapshots).  See libstdc++-v3/docs/html/17_intro/howto.html for
// details on why you don't want to override this setting.  Ensure
// that threads are properly configured on your platform before
// assigning blame to the STL container-memory allocator.  After doing
// so, please report any possible issues to libstdc++@gcc.gnu.org .
// Do not define __USE_MALLOC on the command line.  Enforce it here:
#ifdef __USE_MALLOC
#error __USE_MALLOC should only be defined within \
libstdc++-v3/include/bits/c++config before full recompilation of the library.
#endif
// Define __USE_MALLOC after this point in the file in order to aid debugging
// or globally change allocation policy.  This breaks the ABI, thus
// completely recompile the library.  A patch to better support
// changing the global allocator policy would be probably be accepted.

// The remainder of the prewritten config is mostly automatic; all the
// user hooks are listed above.

// End of prewritten config; the discovered settings follow.
