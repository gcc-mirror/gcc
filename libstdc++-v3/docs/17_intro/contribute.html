<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>   
The Standard C++ Library v3, or libstc++-2.90.x, follows an open development model. Active contributors are assigned maintainer-ship responsibility, and given write access to the CVS repository. First time submitors and all other potential contributors should follow this procedure:

<p>
<hr>
<h4>ONE : read the documentation</h4> 
<p>

<p>
<ul>
 <li> Get and read the relevant sections of the C++ language
specification. Copies of the full ISO 14882 standard are available on
line via the ISO mirror site for committee members. Non-members, or
those who have not paid for the privilege of sitting on the committee
and sustained their two meeting commitment for voting rights, may get
a copy of the standard from their respective national standards
organization. In the USA, this national standards organization is ANSI
and their web-site is right

 <a href="http://www.ansi.org">here.</a> 
(And if you've already registered with them, clicking this link will take you to directly to the place where you can 
<a href="http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ISO%2FIEC+14882%2D1998">buy the standard on-line.)</a>

 <li> Peruse the <a href="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding Standards</a>, and chuckle when you hit the part about "Using Languages Other Than C." 

 <li> Be familiar with the extensions that preceded these general GNU rules. These style issues for libstdc++ can be found in the file C++STYLE, located in the root level of the distribution, or <a href="C++STYLE"> here. </a>

 <li> And last but certainly not least, read the library-specific information found <a href="../documentation.html"> here.</a>

</ul>



<p>
<hr>
<h4>TWO : copyright assignment</h4> 
<p>
Small changes can be accepted without a copyright assignment form on
file. New code and additions to the library need completed copyright
assignment form on file at Cygnus. Note: your employer may be required
to fill out appropriate disclaimer forms as well. Here is the <a href="libstdc++-assign.txt"> form. </a>  

Please contact <a href="mailto:benjamin@cygnus.com">Benjamin
Kosnik</a> if you are confused about the assignment or have general
licensing questions.


<p>
<hr>
<h4>THREE : submitting patches</h4> 
<p>

Every patch must have several pieces of information before it can be
properly evaluated. Ideally (and to ensure the fastest possible
response from the maintainers) it would have all of these pieces:
<p>
<ul>
 <li> A description of the bug and how your patch fixes this bug. For new features a description of the feature and your implementation. 
 <li> A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files for format and content. If using you are using emacs as your editor, simply position the insertion point at the beginning of your change and hit CX-4a to bring up the appropriate ChangeLog entry. See--magic! Similar functionality also exists for vi.
 <li> A testsuite submission or sample program that will easily and simply show the existing error or test new functionality.  
 <li> The patch itself. If you are accessing the CVS repository at Cygnus, use "cvs update; cvs diff -c3p NEW"; else, use
     "diff -c3p OLD NEW" or "diff -up OLD NEW". If your version of diff does not support these options, then get the latest version of GNU diff. 
 <li> When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message
and send it to libstdc++@sourceware.cygnus.com. All patches and related
discussion should be sent to the libstdc++ mailinglist.

</ul>
