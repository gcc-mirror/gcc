<!-- ####################################################### -->

<H2><A NAME="prereqs">Tools you will need beforehand</A></H2>
   <P>You will need a recent version of g++ to compile the snapshot of
      libstdc++, one of the post-2.95.2 GCC
      snapshots (insert standard caveat about using snapshots rather
      than formal releases).  You will need the full source
      distribution to whatever compiler release you are using.  The
      GCC snapshots can be had from one of the sites on their
      <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">mirror list</A>.
   </P>

   <P>In addition, if you plan to modify the makefiles or regenerate
      the configure scripts you'll need the nuevo automake, libtool
      and autoconf to regenerate the Makefiles and configure
      scripts. These tools are all required to be installed in the
      same location (most linux distributions install these tools by
      default, so no worries.)
   </P>

   <P>If you don't have bash, and want to run <TT>'make check'</TT> to
      test your build, you'll need to get bash 2.x.  Also recommended
      is GNU Make, since it is the only 'make' that will parse these
      makefiles correctly.  We are moving to DejaGNU, so you'll
      probably want to get that.
   </P>

   <P>As of June 19, 2000, libstdc++ attempts to use tricky and
      space-saving features of the GNU toolchain, enabled with
      <TT>-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--gc-sections</TT>.
      To obtain maximum benefit from this, binutils after this date
      should also be used (bugs were fixed with C++ exception handling
      related to this change in libstdc++-v3).  The version of these
      tools should be <TT>2.10.90</TT>, and you can get snapshots (as
      well as releases) of binutils
      <A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils">here</A>.
   </P>
 
   <P>Finally, a few system-specific requirements:
      <DL>
        <DT>Cygwin
        <DD>If you are using Cygwin to compile libstdc++-v3 on Win32, you'll
            have to get a version of the cygwin1.dll that is dated on or
            after February 1, 2000.  This is necessary to successfully run
            the script &quot;mknumeric_limits&quot; which probes the
            floating-point
            environment of the host in question -- before this date, Cygwin
            would freeze when running this script.  In addition, you may
            want to get a current version of libtool (say libtool-1.3.4
            and above) as earlier versions supposedly had problems creating
            shared libraries.

      </DL>
   </P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="srcsetup">Setting up the source directories</A></H2>
   <P><EM>As the libstdc++-v3 sources and the core GCC sources have
      converged, more and more effort goes to building the
      library as the default version to be shipped with g++.  With the
      2.90.8 snapshot, and especially for CVS versions after this
      release, this is treated as the usual scenario.  If you want to
      build the library all by itself, you will need to explicitly
      disable certain features (like namespaces) since the core GCC
      library, libgcc.a, will not be rebuilt with those same features.
   </EM>
   </P>

   <P>By default, all configurations of libstdc++-v3 now have namespaces
      enabled.  Being able to select/de-select this option was a complex task
      that had hopelessly confused many otherwise intelligent people, and
      provided an endless stream of silent cursing and cries for help.  
      Because of this, gcc sources are required, and are no longer optional.
   </P>

   <P>The following definitions will be used throughout the rest of this
      document:
      <UL>
         <LI><EM>gccsrcdir</EM>:  The directory holding the source of the
                 compiler.  It should have several subdirectories like
                 <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/libio and <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/gcc.
         <LI><EM>libsrcdir</EM>:  The directory holding the source of the
                 C++ library.
         <LI><EM>gccbuilddir</EM>:  The build directory for the compiler
                 in <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>.  GCC requires that it be built in
                 a different directory than its sources.
         <LI><EM>libbuilddir</EM>:  The build directory for libstdc++.
         <LI><EM>destdir</EM>:  The eventual installation directory for
                 the compiler/libraries, set with the --prefix option to
                 the configure script.
      </UL>
      Note:
      <OL>
         <LI>The .91 snapshot and following are intended to replace the
             library that comes with the compiler, so <EM>libsrcdir</EM>
             and <EM>libbuilddir</EM> must be contained under
             <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> and <EM>gccbuilddir</EM>, respectively.
         <LI>The source, build, and installation directories should
             not be parents of one another; i.e., these should all be
             separate directories. Please don't build out of the
             source directory.
      </OL>
   </P>

   <P>Since the release of libstdc++-2.90.8, configuration patches have gone
      into CVS gcc that make the management of the various libstdc++ source
      trees a bit easier.  Because of this, both libstdc++-v2 and
      libstdc++-v3 and live together in peace, without the need
      for soft linking.  The setup instructions are slightly different,
      depending on whether you want to use CVS gcc or a snapshot.  Please
      choose the appropriate scenario:
   </P>

   <P><B>...with a gcc-2.9[67] snapshot</B>
      <P>Unpack the <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> and go into that directory.  For
         instance, <TT>gcc-2.95.2</TT> is a valid <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>.
         Once in <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>, you'll need to rename or delete
	 the libstdc++-v3 directory which comes with that snapshot:
         <PRE>
   mv libstdc++-v3 libstdc++-v3-previous  <STRONG>[OR]</STRONG>
   rm -r libstdc++-v3</PRE>
      </P>
      <P>Next, unpack the libstdc++-v3 library tarball into the
         <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> directory; it will create a
         <EM>libsrcdir</EM> called <TT>libstdc++-<EM>version</EM></TT>:
         <PRE>
   gzip -dc libstdc++-version.tar.gz | tar xf -</PRE>
      </P>
      <P>Finally, make a soft link between <EM>libsrcdir</EM> and
         <TT>libstdc++-v3</TT> so that libstdc++-v3 will be the default C++
         library used.
         <PRE>
   ln -s <EM>libsrcdir</EM> libstdc++-v3</PRE>
      </P>
   </P>

   <P><B>...with CVS gcc</B> 
      <P>Check out or download the gcc sources: the resulting source
         directory is <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>.  Once in <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>,
         you'll need to rename or delete the libstdc++-v3 directory
	 which comes with that snapshot:
         <PRE>
   mv libstdc++-v3 libstdc++-v3-previous  <STRONG>[OR]</STRONG>
   rm -r libstdc++-v3</PRE>
      </P>
      <P>Next, unpack the libstdc++-v3 library tarball into this
         <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> directory; it will create a
         <EM>libsrcdir</EM> called <TT>libstdc++-<EM>version</EM></TT>:
         <PRE>
   gzip -dc libstdc++-version.tar.gz | tar xf -</PRE>
      </P>
      <P>Finally, rename <EM>libsrcdir</EM> to <TT>libstdc++-v3</TT> so that
         gcc's configure flags will be able to deal with the new library.
         <PRE>
   mv <EM>libsrcdir</EM> libstdc++-v3</PRE>
      </P>
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="config">Configuring</A></H2>
   <P>If you have never done this before, you should read the basic
      <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/">GCC Installation
      Instructions</A> first.
   </P>
   <P>Due to namespaces, when building libstdc++-v3 you'll have to configure
      the entire <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> directory.  The full list of libstdc++-v3
      specific configuration options, not dependent on the specific compiler
      release being used, can be found <A HREF="configopts.html">here</A>.
   </P>
   <P>Consider possibly using --enable-languages=c++ to save time by only
      building the C++ language parts.
   </P>

   <P><PRE>
   cd <EM>gccbuilddir</EM>
   <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/configure --prefix=<EM>destdir</EM> --other-opts...</PRE>
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="install">Building and installing the library</A></H2>
   <P>Now you have a few options:</P>
   <H3>[re]building <EM>everything</EM></H3>
   <P>If you're building GCC from scratch, you can do the usual
      <TT> 'make bootstrap' </TT> here, and libstdc++-v3 will be built
      as its default C++ library.  The generated g++ will magically
      use the correct headers, link against the correct library
      binary, and in general using libstdc++-v3 will be a piece of
      cake.  You're done; run <TT>'make install'</TT> (see the GCC
      installation instructions) to put the new compiler and libraries
      into place.
   </P>

   <H3>[re]building only libstdc++</H3>
   <P>To rebuild just libstdc++, use:
      <PRE>
   make all-target-<EM>libstdc++-v3</EM></PRE>
      This will configure and build the C++ library in the
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-OS/</EM>libstdc++ directory.
   </P>
   <P>If you are rebuilding from a previous build [attempt], some
      information is kept in a cache file.  This is stored in
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-OS/</EM> if you are building with
      multilibs (the default), or in
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-OS/</EM>libstdc++-v3 if you have
      multilibs disabled.  The filename is config.cache; if previous
      information is causing problems, you can delete it entirely, or
      simply edit it and remove lines.
   </P>
   <P>You're done.  Now install the rebuilt pieces with
      <PRE>
   make install</PRE>
      or 
      <PRE>
   make install-gcc
   make install-target-libstdc++-v3</PRE>
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="postinstall">Post-installation</A></H2>
   <P>Installation will create the <EM>destdir</EM> directory and
      populate it with subdirectories:
      <PRE>
   lib/
   include/g++-v3/
      bits/
      ext/
   CPU-vendor-OS/include/g++-v3/
      bits/
      ext/</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>You can check the status of the build without installing it using
      <PRE>
   make check</PRE>
      or you can check the status of the installed library using
      <PRE>
   make check-install</PRE>
      in the <EM>libbuilddir</EM> directory.
      These commands will create a 'testsuite' directory underneath
      <EM>libbuilddir</EM> containing the results of the tests.  We are
      interested in any strange failures of the testsuite; please see
      <A HREF="faq/index.html#2_4">FAQ 2.4</A> for which files to examine.
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="usage">Using the library</A></H2>
   <LI><B>Find the new library at runtime (shared linking only)</B>
       <P>If you only built a static library (libstdc++.a), or if you
          specified static linking, you don't have to worry about this.
          But if you built a shared library (libstdc++.so) and linked
          against it, then you will need to find that library when you
          run the executable.
       </P>
       <P>Methods vary for different platforms and different styles, but
          the usual ones are printed to the screen during installation.
          They include:
          <UL>
          <LI>At runtime set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your environment correctly,
              so that the shared library for libstdc++ can be found and
              loaded.  Be certain that you understand all of the other
              implications and behavior of LD_LIBRARY_PATH first (few
              people do, and they get into trouble).
          <LI>Compile the path to find the library at runtime into the
              program.  This can be done by passing certain options to g++,
              which will in turn pass them on to the linker.  The exact
              format of the options is dependent on which linker you use:
              <UL>
  <LI>GNU ld (default on Linux):<TT>  -Wl,--rpath,<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>IRIX ld:<TT>  -Wl,-rpath,<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>Solaris ld:<TT>  -Wl,-R<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>More...?
              </UL>
          </UL>
       </P>
       <P>Use the <TT>ldd(1)</TT> utility to show which library the system
          thinks it will get at runtime.
       </P>
   </OL>
