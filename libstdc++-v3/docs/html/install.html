<H2><A NAME="prereqs">Tools you will need beforehand</A></H2>
   <P>You will need a recent version of g++ to compile the snapshot of
      libstdc++, such as one of the GCC 3.x snapshots (insert standard
      caveat about using snapshots rather than formal releases).  You
      will need the full source
      distribution to whatever compiler release you are using.  The
      GCC snapshots can be had from one of the sites on their
      <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">mirror list</A>.
   </P>

   <P>In addition, if you plan to modify the makefiles or regenerate the
      configure scripts you'll need recent versions of the GNU Autotools:
      autoconf (version 2.50 or later),
      automake (version 1.4 or later),    <!-- special version? -->
      and libtool (multilanguage, version 1.4 or later),  <!-- really? -->
      in order to rebuild the files.
      These tools are all required to be installed in the same location
      (most linux distributions install these tools by default, so no
      worries as long as the versions are correct).
   </P>

   <P>GNU Make is the only 'make' that will parse the makefiles correctly.
   </P>

   <P>To test your build, you will need either DejaGNU 1.4 (to run
      <TT>'make check'</TT> like
      <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html">the rest of GCC</A>),
      or Bash 2.x (to run <TT>'make check-script'</TT>).
   </P>

   <P>As of June 19, 2000, libstdc++ attempts to use tricky and
      space-saving features of the GNU toolchain, enabled with
      <TT>-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -Wl,--gc-sections</TT>.
      To obtain maximum benefit from this, binutils after this date
      should also be used (bugs were fixed with C++ exception handling
      related to this change in libstdc++-v3).  The version of these
      tools should be <TT>2.10.90</TT>, and you can get snapshots (as
      well as releases) of binutils
      <A HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils">here</A>.
   </P>
 
 <!-- Commented until some system-specific requirements appear.
   <P>Finally, a few system-specific requirements:
      <DL>
        <DT>Cygwin
        <DD>If you are using Cygwin to compile libstdc++-v3 on Win32, you'll

<H2><A NAME="srcsetup">Setting up the source directories</A></H2>
   <P>The following definitions will be used throughout the rest of this
      document:
      <UL>
         <LI><EM>gccsrcdir</EM>:  The directory holding the source of the
                 compiler.  It should have several subdirectories like
                 <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/libio and <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/gcc.
         <LI><EM>libsrcdir</EM>:  The directory holding the source of the
                 C++ library.
         <LI><EM>gccbuilddir</EM>:  The build directory for the compiler
                 in <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>.  GCC requires that it be built in
                 a different directory than its sources.
         <LI><EM>libbuilddir</EM>:  The build directory for libstdc++.
         <LI><EM>destdir</EM>:  The eventual installation directory for
                 the compiler/libraries, set with the --prefix option to
                 the configure script.
      </UL>
      Note:
      <OL>
         <LI>The 3.0 version and following are intended to replace the
             library that comes with the compiler, so <EM>libsrcdir</EM>
             and <EM>libbuilddir</EM> must be contained under
             <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> and <EM>gccbuilddir</EM>, respectively.
         <LI>The source, build, and installation directories should
             not be parents of one another; i.e., these should all be
             separate directories. Please don't build out of the
             source directory.
      </OL>
   </P>

   <P>Check out or download the gcc sources: the resulting source directory
      (<TT>gcc</TT> or <TT>gcc-3.0</TT>, for example) is <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>.
      Once in <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>, you'll need to rename or delete the
      libstdc++-v3 directory which comes with that snapshot:
      <PRE>
   mv libstdc++-v3 libstdc++-v3-previous  <STRONG>[OR]</STRONG>
   rm -r libstdc++-v3</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>Next, unpack the libstdc++-v3 library tarball into this
      <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> directory; it will create a
      <EM>libsrcdir</EM> called <TT>libstdc++-<EM>version</EM></TT>:
      <PRE>
   gzip -dc libstdc++-version.tar.gz | tar xf -</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>Finally, rename <EM>libsrcdir</EM> to <TT>libstdc++-v3</TT> so that
      gcc's configure flags will be able to deal with the new library.
      <PRE>
   mv <EM>libsrcdir</EM> libstdc++-v3</PRE>
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="config">Configuring</A></H2>
   <P>If you have never done this before, you should read the basic
      <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/">GCC Installation
      Instructions</A> first.
   </P>
   <P>When building libstdc++-v3 you'll have to configure
      the entire <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> directory.  The full list of libstdc++-v3
      specific configuration options, not dependent on the specific compiler
      release being used, can be found <A HREF="configopts.html">here</A>.
   </P>
   <P>Consider possibly using --enable-languages=c++ to save time by only
      building the C++ language parts.
   </P>

   <P><PRE>
   cd <EM>gccbuilddir</EM>
   <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/configure --prefix=<EM>destdir</EM> --other-opts...</PRE>
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="install">Building and installing the library</A></H2>
   <P>Now you have a few options:</P>
   <H3>[re]building <EM>everything</EM></H3>
   <P>If you're building GCC from scratch, you can do the usual
      <TT> 'make bootstrap' </TT> here, and libstdc++-v3 will be built
      as its default C++ library.  The generated g++ will magically
      use the correct headers, link against the correct library
      binary, and in general using libstdc++-v3 will be a piece of
      cake.  You're done; run <TT>'make install'</TT> (see the GCC
      installation instructions) to put the new compiler and libraries
      into place.
   </P>

   <H3>[re]building only libstdc++</H3>
   <P>To rebuild just libstdc++, use:
      <PRE>
   make all-target-<EM>libstdc++-v3</EM></PRE>
      This will configure and build the C++ library in the
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-os/</EM>libstdc++ directory.
   </P>
   <P>If you are rebuilding from a previous build [attempt], some
      information is kept in a cache file.  This is stored in
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-os/</EM> if you are building with
      multilibs (the default), or in
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-os/</EM>libstdc++-v3 if you have
      multilibs disabled.  The filename is config.cache; if previous
      information is causing problems, you can delete it entirely, or
      simply edit it and remove lines.
   </P>
   <P>You're done.  Now install the rebuilt pieces with
      <PRE>
   make install</PRE>
      or 
      <PRE>
   make install-gcc
   make install-target-libstdc++-v3</PRE>
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="postinstall">Post-installation</A></H2>
   <P>Installation will create the <EM>destdir</EM> directory and
      populate it with subdirectories:
      <PRE>
   lib/
   include/g++-v3/
      backward/
      bits/
      <EM>cpu-vendor-os</EM>/bits/
      ext/</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>You can check the status of the build without installing it using
      <PRE>
   make check</PRE>
      or you can check the status of the installed library using
      <PRE>
   make check-install</PRE>
      in the <EM>libbuilddir</EM> directory.
      These commands will create a 'testsuite' directory underneath
      <EM>libbuilddir</EM> containing the results of the tests.  We are
      interested in any strange failures of the testsuite; please see
      <A HREF="faq/index.html#2_4">FAQ 2.4</A> for which files to examine.
   </P>


<HR>
<H2><A NAME="usage">Using the library</A></H2>
   <LI><B>Find the new library at runtime (shared linking only)</B>
       <P>If you only built a static library (libstdc++.a), or if you
          specified static linking, you don't have to worry about this.
          But if you built a shared library (libstdc++.so) and linked
          against it, then you will need to find that library when you
          run the executable.
       </P>
       <P>Methods vary for different platforms and different styles, but
          the usual ones are printed to the screen during installation.
          They include:
          <UL>
          <LI>At runtime set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your environment correctly,
              so that the shared library for libstdc++ can be found and
              loaded.  Be certain that you understand all of the other
              implications and behavior of LD_LIBRARY_PATH first (few
              people do, and they get into trouble).
          <LI>Compile the path to find the library at runtime into the
              program.  This can be done by passing certain options to g++,
              which will in turn pass them on to the linker.  The exact
              format of the options is dependent on which linker you use:
              <UL>
  <LI>GNU ld (default on Linux):<TT>  -Wl,--rpath,<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>IRIX ld:<TT>  -Wl,-rpath,<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>Solaris ld:<TT>  -Wl,-R<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>More...?
              </UL>
          </UL>
       </P>
       <P>Use the <TT>ldd(1)</TT> utility to show which library the system
          thinks it will get at runtime.
       </P>
       <P>A libstdc++.la file is also installed, for use with Libtool.  If
          you use Libtool to create your executables, these details are
          taken care of for you.
       </P>
   </OL>
   </P>
