<h1 CLASS="centered"><a name="top">Chapter 18:  Library Support</a></h1>

<p>Chapter 18 deals with the functions called and objects created
   automatically during the course of a program's existence.
</p>
<p>While we can't reproduce the contents of the Standard here (you need to
   get your own copy from your nation's member body; see our homepage for
   help), we can mention a couple of changes in what kind of support a C++
   program gets from the Standard Library.

<h2><a name="1">Types</a></h2>
   <p>All the types that you're used to in C are here in one form or
      another.  The only change that might affect people is the type of
      NULL:  while it is required to be a macro, the definition of that
      macro is <em>not</em> allowed to be <code>(void*)0</code>, which is
      often used in C.
   </p>
   <p>In g++, NULL is #define'd to be <code>__null</code>, a magic keyword
      extension of g++.
   </p>
   <p>The biggest problem of #defining NULL to be something like
      &quot;0L&quot; is that the compiler will view that as a long integer
      before it views it as a pointer, so overloading won't do what you
      expect.  (This is why g++ has a magic extension, so that NULL is
      always a pointer.)
   </p>
   <p>In his book
      <a href="http://cseng.aw.com/bookdetail.qry?ISBN=0-201-92488-9&ptype=0"><em>Effective C++</em></a>,
      Scott Meyers points out that the best way to solve this problem is to
      not overload on pointer-vs-integer types to begin with.  He also
      offers a way to make your own magic NULL that will match pointers
      before it matches integers:
      <PRE>
   const                             // this is a const object...
   class {
   public:
     template&lt;class T&gt;               // convertible to any type
       operator T*() const           // of null non-member
       { return 0; }                 // pointer...

     template&lt;class C, class T&gt;      // or any type of null
       operator T C::*() const       // member pointer...
       { return 0; }

   private:
     void operator&amp;() const;         // whose address can't be
                                     // taken (see Item 27)...

   } NULL;                           // and whose name is NULL
      </PRE>(Cribbed from the published version of
      <a href="http://www.awlonline.com/cseng/meyerscddemo/">the
      Effective C++ CD</a>, reproduced here with permission.)
   </p>
   <p>If you aren't using g++ (why?), but you do have a compiler which
      supports member function templates, then you can use this definition
      of NULL (be sure to #undef any existing versions).  It only helps if
      you actually use NULL in function calls, though; if you make a call of
      <code>foo(0);</code> instead of <code>foo(NULL);</code>, then you're back
      where you started.
   </p>
   <p><B>Added Note:</B>  When we contacted Dr. Meyers to ask permission to
      print this stuff, it prompted him to run this code through current
      compilers to see what the state of the art is with respect to member
      template functions.  He posted
      <a href="http://www.deja.com/threadmsg_md.xp?AN=644660779.1&CONTEXT=964036823.871301239">an
      article to Usenet</a> after discovering that the code above is not
      valid!  Even though it has no data members, it still needs a
      user-defined constructor (which means that the class needs a type name
      after all).  The ctor can have an empty body; it just needs to be
      there.  (Stupid requirement?  We think so too, and this will probably
      be changed in the language itself.)

   <h3><CODE>&lt;limits&gt;</CODE></h3>
   This header mainly defines traits classes to give access to various
   implementation defined-aspects of the fundamental types.  The
   traits classes -- fourteen in total -- are all specilizations of the 
   template class <CODE>numeric_limits</CODE> defined as follows:
   <PRE>
   template&lt;typename T&gt; struct class {

<h2><a name="3">Start and Termination</a></h2>
   <p>Not many changes here to <code>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code> (the old stdlib.h).
      You should note that the <code>abort()</code> function does not call
      the destructors of automatic nor static objects, so if you're depending
      on those to do cleanup, it isn't going to happen.  (The functions
      registered with <code>atexit()</code> don't get called either, so you
      can forget about that possibility, too.)
   </p>
   <p>The good old <code>exit()</code> function can be a bit funky, too, until
      you look closer.  Basically, three points to remember are:
      <ol>
        <li>Static objects are destroyed in reverse order of their creation.
        <li>Functions registered with <code>atexit()</code> are called in
            reverse order of registration, once per registration call.
            (This isn't actually new.)
        <li>The previous two actions are &quot;interleaved,&quot; that is,
            given this pseudocode:
            <PRE>
              extern "C or C++" void  f1 (void);
              extern "C or C++" void  f2 (void);

              static Thing obj1;
              atexit(f1);
              static Thing obj2;
              atexit(f2);
            </PRE>then at a call of <code>exit()</code>, f2 will be called, then
            obj2 will be destroyed, then f1 will be called, and finally obj1
            will be destroyed.  If f1 or f2 allow an exception to propogate
            out of them, Bad Things happen.
      </ol>
   </p>
   <p>Note also that <code>atexit()</code> is only required to store 32
      functions, and the compiler/library might already be using some of
      those slots.  If you think you may run out, we recommend using
      the xatexit/xexit combination from libiberty, which has no such limit.

<h2><a name="4">Dynamic memory management</a></h2>
   <p>There are six flavors each of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, so
      make certain that you're using the right ones!  Here are quickie
      descriptions of <code>new</code>:
      <ul>
        <li>single object form, throwing a <code>bad_alloc</code> on errors;
            this is what most people are used to using
        <li>single object &quot;nothrow&quot; form, returning NULL on errors
        <li>array new, throwing <code>bad_alloc</code> on errors
        <li>array nothrow new, returning NULL on errors
        <li>placement new, which does nothing (like it's supposed to)
        <li>placement array new, which also does nothing
      </ul>
      They are distinguished by the parameters that you pass to them, like
      any other overloaded function.  The six flavors of <code>delete</code>
      are distinguished the same way, but none of them are allowed to throw
      an exception under any circumstances anyhow.  (They match up for
      completeness' sake.)
   </p>
   <p>Remember that it is perfectly okay to call <code>delete</code> on a
      NULL pointer!  Nothing happens, by definition.  That is not the
      same thing as deleting a pointer twice.
   </p>
   <p>By default, if one of the &quot;throwing <code>new</code>s&quot; can't
      allocate the memory requested, it tosses an instance of a
      <code>bad_alloc</code> exception (or, technically, some class derived
      from it).  You can change this by writing your own function (called
      a new-handler) and then registering it with <code>set_new_handler()</code>:
      <PRE>
   typedef void (*PFV)(void);

   static char*  safety;
   static PFV    old_handler;

   void my_new_handler ()
   {
       delete[] safety;
       popup_window ("Dude, you are running low on heap memory.  You
                      should, like, close some windows, or something.
                      The next time you run out, we're gonna burn!");
       set_new_handler (old_handler);
       return;
   }

   int main ()
   {
       safety = new char[500000];
       old_handler = set_new_handler (&my_new_handler);
       ...
   }
      </PRE>
   </p>
   <p><code>bad_alloc</code> is derived from the base <code>exception</code>
      class defined in Chapter 19.
