<h1 CLASS="centered"><a name="top">Chapter 17:  Library Introduction</a></h1>

<p>Chapter 17 is actually a list of definitions and descriptions used
   in the following chapters of the Standard when describing the actual
   library.  Here, we use &quot;Introduction&quot; as an introduction
   to the <em>GNU implementation of</em> the ISO Standard C++ Library.

<h2><a name="2">The Standard C++ header files</a></h2>
   <p>The Standard C++ Library specifies 50 header files that must be
      available to all hosted implementations.  Actually, the word
      &quot;files&quot; is a misnomer, since the contents of the headers
      don't necessarily have to be in any kind of external file.  The
      only rule is that when you <code>#include</code> a certain header, the
      contents of that header, as defined by the Standard, become
      available to you, no matter how.
   </p>
   <p>The names of the headers can be easily seen in
      <a href="headers_cc.txt"><code>testsuite/17_intro/headers.cc</code></a>,
      which is a small testbed we use to make certain that the headers
      all compile and run.
   </p>

<h2><a name="3">Thread-safety</a></h2>
   <p>This is a thorny issue that gets brought up on the libstdc++-v3
      and gcc mailing lists on a regular basis (probably by a cron job).
      This entry will mention a very little bit about the general MT
      issues with libstdc++.  The latest status and quick notes will be
      in FAQ 5.6.  Some discussion about thread-safe containers will be
      in section 6.8 (the HOWTOs on containers).  This section only applies
      when gcc and libstdc++-v3 were configured with --enable-threads.
   </p>
   <p>The libstdc++ code (all of it, not just the containers) has been
      designed so that thread-safety will be easily possible.  The first
      (!) problem is finding a <em>fast</em> method of implementation
      portable to all platforms.  A minor problem that pops up every so
      often is different interpretations of what &quot;thread-safe&quot;
      means for a library (not a general program).  We currently use the
      <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html">same
      definition that SGI</a> uses for their STL subset.
      <em>Please see the many cautions given in HOWTOs on containers.</em>
   </p>
   <p>Here is another attempt at explaining the dangers of using the
      STL with threading support without understanding some important
      details.  The STL implementation is currently configured to use
      the high-speed caching memory allocator.  If you absolutely
      think you must change this on a global basis for your platform
      to support multi-threading, then please consult all commentary
      in include/bits/c++config and the HOWTOs on containers.  Be
      fully aware that you may change the external or internal ABI of
      libstdc++-v3 when you provide -D__USE_MALLOC on the command line
      or make a change to that configuration file.
   </p>
   <p>If you don't like caches of objects being retained inside the STL, then
      you might be tempted to define __USE_MALLOC either on the command
      line or by rebuilding c++config.h.  Please note, once you define
      __USE_MALLOC, only the malloc allocator is visible to application code
      (i.e. the typically higher-speed allocator is not even available
      in this configuration).  There is a better way:  It is possible
      to force the malloc-based allocator on a per-case-basis for some
      application code even when the above macro symbol is not defined.
      The library team generally believes that this is a better way to tune
      an application for high-speed using this implementation of the STL.
      Here is one possible example displaying the forcing of the malloc-based
      allocator over the typically higher-speed default allocator:
      <PRE>
      std::list &lt;void*, std::malloc_alloc&gt;  my_malloc_based_list;
      </PRE>
   </p>
   <p>A recent journal article has described &quot;atomic integer
      operations,&quot; which would allow us to, well, perform updates
      on integers atomically, and without requiring an explicit mutex
      lock.  This appears promising, but the major difficulty is that
      these operations &quot;may not be available on all systems, and
      if they are, may have different interfaces.&quot; [quoting from
      mailing list messages]
   </p>
   <p>Here is a small link farm to threads (no pun) in the mail archives
      that discuss the threading problem.  Each link is to the first
      relevent message in the thread; from there you can use
      &quot;Thread Next&quot; to move down the thread.  This farm is in
      latest-to-oldest order.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-05/msg00384.html">
        inspired this most recent updating of issues with threading
        and the SGI STL library.  It also contains some example
        POSIX-multithreaded STL code.</a>
        <li> <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-05/msg00136.html">
        an early analysis of why __USE_MALLOC should be disabled for
        the 3.0 release of libstdc++.</a>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Here are discussions that took place before the current snapshot;
      they are still relevant and instructive.  (Some of them may not work;
      as the drive containing some of the 1999 archives crashed, and nobody
      has had time to recover the backups.)
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>One way of preventing memory leaks by the old default memory
            allocator in multithreaded code is
            <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/1999-11n/msg00431.html">discussed here</a>.
        <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/1999-q3/msg00167.html">This thread
            concerns strings</a>.
        <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/1999-q2/msg00339.html">So does this
            one</a>.  This initial message also refers to another
            thread in the GCC mailing list...
        <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/1999-06n/msg00680.html">which is here</a>,
            and goes on for some time.  Ironically, the initial message
            in this thread also mentions another threading thread...
        <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/1999-04n/msg00777.html">beginning here</a>,
            and talking about pthreads.  (Note that a much more recent
            message from the first thread in this list notes that
            <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/1999-q3/msg00176.html">pthreads
            should not be used as a starting point</a> for making
            libstdc++ threadsafe.)
        <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/1999-q2/msg00168.html">This
            message</a>,
            <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/1999-q2/msg00159.html">this one</a>,
            and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/1999-q2/msg00156.html">this one</a>
            are the tops of related threads (all within the same time
            period) discussing threading and the IO library.  Much of it
            is dealing with the C library, but C++ is included as well.

<h2><a name="4"><code>&lt;foo&gt;</code> vs <code>&lt;foo.h&gt;</code></a></h2>
   <p>The new-style headers are fully supported in libstdc++-v3.  The compiler
      itself fully supports namespaces, including <code>std::</code>.
   </p>
   <p>For those of you new to ISO C++98, no, that isn't a typo, the headers
      really have new names.  Marshall Cline's C++ FAQ Lite has a good
      explanation in
<a href="http://www.cerfnet.com/~mpcline/On-Line-C++-FAQ/coding-standards.html#[25.4]">item [25.4]</a>.
