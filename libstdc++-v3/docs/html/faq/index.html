<!-- I suspect these will mostly be links to/into existing documents. -->
   <H2><A NAME="1_1">1.1 What is libstdc++-v3?</A></H2>
      <P>The GNU Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.9x, is an 
         ongoing project to implement the ISO 14882 Standard C++ library 
         as described in chapters 17 through 27 and annex D.  As the 
         library reaches stable plateaus, it is captured in a snapshot
         and released.  The current release is <A
HREF="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/libstdc++/libstdc++-2.92.tar.gz">the
         eleventh snapshot</A>.  For those who want to see exactly how
         far the project has come, or just want the latest
         bleeding-edge code, the up-to-date source is available over
         anonymous CVS, and can even be browsed over the Web (see below). 
      </P> 
      <P>A more formal description of the V3 goals can be found in the
         official <A HREF="../17_intro/DESIGN">design document</A>. 
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_2">1.2 Why should I use libstdc++?</A></H2>
      <P>The completion of the ISO C++ standardization gave the
         C++ community a powerful set of reuseable tools in the form
         of the C++ Standard Library.  However, all existing C++
         implementations are (as the Draft Standard used to say)
         &quot;incomplet and incorrekt,&quot; and many suffer from
         limitations of the compilers that use them.
      </P> 
      <P>The GNU C/C++/FORTRAN/&lt;pick-a-language&gt; compiler
         (<TT>gcc</TT>, <TT>g++</TT>, etc) is widely considered to be
         one of the leading compilers in the world.  Its development
         has recently been taken over by the 
         <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC team</A>.  All of
         the rapid development and near-legendary
     <A
HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/buildstat.html">portability</A>
         that are the hallmarks of an open-source project are being
         applied to libstdc++.
      </P>
      <P>That means that all of the Standard classes and functions
         (such as <TT>string</TT>, <TT>vector&lt;&gt;</TT>, iostreams,
         and algorithms) will be freely available and fully compliant.
         Programmers will no longer need to &quot;roll their own&quot;
         nor be worried about platform-specific incompatabilities.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_3">1.3 Who's in charge of it?</A></H2>
      <P>The libstdc++ project is contributed to by several developers
         all over the world, in the same way as GCC or Linux.
         Benjamin Kosnik, Gabriel Dos Reis, Phil Edwards, and Ulrich
         Drepper are the lead maintainers of the CVS archive.
      </P>
      <P>Development and discussion is held on the libstdc++ mailing
         list.  Subscribing to the list, or searching the list
         archives, is open to everyone.  You can read instructions for
         doing so on the <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/">homepage</A>.
         If you have questions, ideas, code, or are just curious, sign up!
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_4">1.4 How do I get libstdc++?</A></H2>
      <P>The eleventh (and latest) snapshot of libstdc++-v3 is <A
HREF="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/libstdc++/libstdc++-2.92.tar.gz">
         available via ftp</A>.
      </P>
      <P>The <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/">homepage</A>
         has instructions for retrieving the latest CVS sources, and for
         browsing the CVS sources over the web.
      </P>
      <P>The subset commonly known as the Standard Template Library
         (chapters 23 through 25, mostly) is adapted from the SGI STL,
         which is also an ongoing work.<!-- Possibly a link to SGI's

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_6">1.6 How do I contribute to the effort?</A></H2>
      <P>Here is <A HREF="../17_intro/contribute.html">a
         page devoted to this topic</A>.  Subscribing to the mailing
         list (see above, or the homepage) is a very good idea if you
         have something to contribute, or if you have spare time and
         want to help.  Contributions don't have to be in the form of
         source code; anybody who is willing to help write
         documentation, for example, or has found a bug in code that
         we all thought was working, is more than welcome!
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_7">1.7 What happened to libg++?  I need that!</A></H2>
      <P>The most recent libg++ README states that libg++ is no longer
         being actively maintained.  It should not be used for new
         projects, and is only being kicked along to support older code.
      </P>
      <P>The libg++ was designed and created when there was no Standard
         to provide guidance.  Classes like linked lists are now provided
         for by <TT>list&lt;T&gt;</TT> and do not need to be created by
         <TT>genclass</TT>.  (For that matter, templates exist now and
         are well-supported, whereas genclass (mostly) predates them.)
      </P>
      <P>There are other classes in libg++ that are not specified in the
         ISO Standard (e.g., statistical analysis).  While there are a
         lot of really useful things that are used by a lot of people
         (e.g., statistics :-), the Standards Committee couldn't include
         everything, and so a lot of those &quot;obvious&quot; classes
         didn't get included.
      </P>
      <P>Since libstdc++ is an implementation of the Standard Library, we
         have no plans at this time to include non-Standard utilities
         in the implementation, however handy they are.  (The extensions
         provided in the SGI STL aren't maintained by us and don't get
         a lot of our attention, because they don't require a lot of our
         time.)  It is entirely plausable that the &quot;useful stuff&quot;
         from libg++ might be extracted into an updated utilities library,
         but nobody has stated such a project yet.
      </P>
      <!-- The advertisement, so to speak, might have to go.  Hmmmmm.  -->
      <P>(The <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</A> site houses free
         C++ libraries that do varying things, and happened to be started
         by members of the Standards Committee.  Certain &quot;useful
         stuff&quot; classes will probably migrate there.)
      </P>
      <P>For the bold and/or desperate, the
         <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/33.html">GCC FAQ</A>
         describes where to find the last libg++ source.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_8">1.8 What if I have more questions?</A></H2>
      <P>If you have read the README and RELEASE-NOTES files, and your
         question remains unanswered, then just ask the mailing list.
         At present, you do not need to be subscribed to the list to
         send a message to it.  More information is available on the

<H1><A NAME="2_0">2.0 Installation</A></H1>
   <H2><A NAME="2_1">2.1 How do I install libstdc++-v3?</A></H2>
      <P>Complete instructions are not given here (this is a FAQ, not
         an installation document), but the tools required are few:
      </P>
         <UL>
            <LI> A 3.x release of GCC.  Note that building GCC is much
                 easier and more automated than building the GCC 2.[78]
                 series was.  If you are using GCC 2.95, you can still
                 build earlier snapshots of libstdc++.
            <LI> GNU Make is recommended, but should not be required.
            <LI> The GNU Autotools are needed if you are messing with
                 the configury or makefiles.
         </UL>
      <P>The file <A HREF="../documentation.html">documentation.html</A>
         provides a good overview of the steps necessary to build, install,
         and use the library.  Instructions for configuring the library
         with new flags such as --enable-threads are there also, as well as
         patches and instructions for working with GCC 2.95.
      </P>
      <P>The top-level install.html and
         <A HREF="../17_intro/RELEASE-NOTES">RELEASE-NOTES</A> files contain
         the exact build and installation instructions.  You may wish to
         browse those files over CVSweb ahead of time to get a feel for
         what's required.  RELEASE-NOTES is located in the
         &quot;.../docs/17_intro/&quot; directory of the distribution.

                         keep mentioning?</A></H2>
      <P>The <EM>Concurrent Versions System</EM> is one of several revision
         control packages.  It was selected for GNU projects because it's
         free (speech), free (beer), and very high quality.  The <A

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="2_4">2.4 How do I know if it works?</A></H2>
      <P>libstdc++-v3 comes with its own testsuite.  You do not need
         to actually install the library (&quot;<TT>make
         install</TT>&quot;) to run the testsuite.
      </P>
      <P>To run the testsuite on the library after building it, use
         &quot;make check&quot; while in your build directory.  To run
         the testsuite on the library after building and installing it,
         use &quot;make check-install&quot; instead.
      </P>
      <P>If you find bugs in the testsuite programs themselves, or if
         you think of a new test program that should be added to the

                         favorite compiler&gt;?</A></H2>
      <P>Probably not.  Yet.</P>
      <P>Because GCC advances so rapidly, development and testing of
         libstdc++ is being done almost entirely under that compiler.
         If you are curious about whether other, lesser compilers
         (*grin*) support libstdc++, you are more than welcome to try.
         Configuring and building the library (see above) will still
         require certain tools, however.  Also keep in mind that
         <EM>building</EM> libstdc++ does not imply that your compiler
         will be able to <EM>use</EM> all of the features found in the
         C++ Standard Library.
      </P>
      <P>Since the goal of ISO Standardization is for all C++
         implementations to be able to share code, the final libstdc++
         should, in theory, be useable under any ISO-compliant
         compiler.  It will still be targeted and optimized for
         GCC/g++, however.

<pre>
New:
---
- preliminary doxygen documentation has been added. Running &quot;make
  doxygen&quot; in the libstdc++-v3 build directory will generate HTML
  documentation that can be used to cross-reference names and files in
  the library.
- a dejagnu based testing framework has been added
- a new implementation of the concept checking code has been ported
  from the boost libraries.
- support for -fno-exceptions has been added
- stdexcept was re-written
- using deprecated or antiquated headers now gives a warning
- the stdio interface to iostreams has been tweaked, and now works
  with synchronized c/c++ io
- new libsupc++ routines implementing the IA-64 C++ ABI.
- HPUX configuration files
- support for AIX added
- a lot of bugs were fixed.
- preliminary named locales implemented
- portability improvements made to generation of &lt;limits&gt;
- speedups to improve configuration time.
- DJGPP support added.
- support for dlopening shared libstdc++

   <H2><A NAME="4_4">4.4 Things in libstdc++ that look like bugs</A></H2>
      <P>There are things which are not bugs in the compiler (4.2) nor
         the language specification (4.3), but aren't really bugs in
         libstdc++, either.  Really!  Please do not report these as bugs.
      </P>
      <A NAME="4_4_Weff">
        <P><STRONG>-Weffc++</STRONG>
           The biggest of these is the quadzillions of warnings about the
           library headers emitted when <TT>-Weffc++</TT> is used.  Making
           libstdc++ &quot;-Weffc++-clean&quot; is not a goal of the project,
           for a few reasons.  Mainly, that option tries to enforce
           object-oriented programming, while the Standard Library isn't
           necessarily trying to be OO.  There are multiple solutions
           under discussion.

      <A NAME="4_4_rel_ops">
        <P><STRONG>rel_ops</STRONG>
           Another is the <TT>rel_ops</TT> namespace and the template
           comparison operator functions contained therein.  If they become
           visible in the same namespace as other comparison functions
           (e.g., '<TT>using</TT>' them and the &lt;iterator&gt; header),
           then you will suddenly be faced with huge numbers of ambiguity
           errors.  This was discussed on the -v3 list; Nathan Myers
           <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-01/msg00247.html">sums

        <P>If you have found an extremely broken header file which is
           causing problems for you, look carefully before submitting a
           &quot;high&quot; priority bug report (which you probably shouldn't
           do anyhow; see the last paragraph of the page describing
         <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gnatswrite.html">the GCC bug database</A>).
        </P>
        <P>If the headers are in <CODE>${prefix}/include/g++-3</CODE>, then
           you are using the old libstdc++-v2 library, which is nonstandard
           and unmaintained.  Do not report problems with -v2 to the -v3
           mailing list.
        </P>
        <P>Currently our header files are installed in
           <CODE>${prefix}/include/g++-v3</CODE> (see the 'v'?).  This may
           change with the next release of GCC, as it may be too confusing,
           but <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-10/msg00732.html">the

           If you're on a GNU/Linux system and have just upgraded to
           glibc 2.2, but are still using gcc 2.95.2, then you should have
           read the glibc FAQ, specifically 2.34:
   <PRE>
2.34.   When compiling C++ programs, I get a compilation error in streambuf.h.

{BH} You are using g++ 2.95.2? After upgrading to glibc 2.2, you need to
apply a patch to the include files in /usr/include/g++, because the fpos_t
type has changed in glibc 2.2.  The patch is at
http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/gccinclude-glibc-2.2-compat.diff
   </PRE>
           Note that 2.95.x shipped with the
           <A HREF="#4_4_interface">old v2 library</A> which is no longer
           maintained.  Also note that gcc 2.95.3 fixes this problem, but
           requires a separate patch for libstdc++-v3.

           member function, then most likely you have violated one of the
           requirements for types used during instantiation of template
           containers and functions.  For example, EqualityComparableConcept
           appears if your types must be comparable with == and you have not
           provided this capability (a typo, or wrong visibility, or you
           just plain forgot, etc).

   <H2><A NAME="4_5">4.5 Aw, that's easy to fix!</A></H2>
      <P>If you have found a bug in the library and you think you have
         a working fix, then send it in!  The main GCC site has a page
         on <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html">submitting
         patches</A> that covers the procedure, but for libstdc++ you
         should also send the patch to our mailing list in addition to
         the GCC patches mailing list.  The libstdc++
         <A HREF="../17_intro/contribute.html">contributors' page</A>
         also talks about how to submit patches.
      </P>
      <P>In addition to the description, the patch, and the ChangeLog
         entry, it is a Good Thing if you can additionally create a small
         test program to test for the presence of the bug that your
         patch fixes.  Bugs have a way of being reintroduced; if an old
         bug creeps back in, it will be caught immediately by the

                     vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator is not T*</A></H2>
      <P>If you have code that depends on container&lt;T&gt; iterators
         being implemented as pointer-to-T, your code is broken.
      </P>
      <P>While there are arguments for iterators to be implemented in
         that manner, A) they aren't very good ones in the long term,
         and B) they were never guaranteed by the Standard anyway.  The
         type-safety achieved by making iterators a real class rather
         than a typedef for <TT>T*</TT> outweighs nearly all opposing
         arguments.
      </P>
      <P>Code which does assume that a vector iterator <code> i </code>
         is a pointer can often be fixed by changing <code> i </code> in
         certain expressions to <code> &amp;*i </code>.  Future revisions
         of the Standard are expected to bless this usage for
         vector&lt;&gt; (but not for basic_string&lt;&gt;).

   <H2><A NAME="5_2">5.2 What's next after libstdc++-v3?</A></H2>
      <P>Hopefully, not much.  The goal of libstdc++-v3 is to produce
         a fully-compliant, fully-portable Standard Library.  After that,
         we're mostly done:  there won't <EM>be</EM> any more compliance
         work to do.  However:
      </P>
      <OL>
      <LI><P>The ISO Committee will meet periodically to review Defect Reports
         in the C++ Standard.  Undoubtedly some of these will result in
         changes to the Standard, which will be reflected in patches to
         libstdc++.  Some of that is already happening, see 4.2.  Some of
         those changes are being predicted by the library maintainers, and
         we add code to the library based on what the current proposed
         resolution specifies.
      </P>
      <LI><P>Performance tuning.  Lots of performance tuning.  This too is
         already underway for post-3.0 releases, starting with memory
         expansion in container classes and buffer usage in synchronized
         stream objects.
      </P>
      <LI><P>An ABI for libstdc++ will eventually be developed, so that
         multiple binary-incompatible copies of the library can be replaced
         with a single backwards-compatible library, like libgcc_s.so is.
      </P>
      <LI><P>The current libstdc++ contains extensions to the Library which
         must be explicitly requested by client code (for example, the
         hash tables from SGI).  Other extensions may be added to
         libstdc++-v3 if they seem to be &quot;standard&quot; enough.
         (For example, the &quot;long long&quot; type from C99.)
         Bugfixes and rewrites (to improve or fix thread safety, for
         instance) will of course be a continuing task.

      <P>The <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/">STL from SGI</A>,
         version 3.3, was the most recent merge of the STL codebase.  The
         code in libstdc++ contains many fixes and changes, and it is
         very likely that the SGI code is no longer under active
         development.  We expect that no future merges will take place.
      </P>
      <P>In particular, <TT>string</TT> is not from SGI and makes no
         use of their &quot;rope&quot; class (which is included as an
         optional extension), nor is <TT>valarray</TT> and some others.
         Classes like <TT>vector&lt;&gt;</TT> are, however.

      <P>Quick answer:  no, as of 2.92 (eleventh snapshot), the
