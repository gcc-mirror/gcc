                            1.0 General Information
                                       
1.1 What is libstdc++-v3?

   The GNU Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.90.x, is an ongoing
   project to implement the ISO 14882 Standard C++ library as described
   in chapters 17 through 27 and annex D. As the library reaches stable
   plateaus, it is captured in a snapshot and released. The current
   release is [35]the ninth snapshot. For those who want to see exactly
   how far the project has come, or just want the latest bleeding-edge
   code, the up-to-date source is available over anonymous CVS, and can
   even be browsed over the Web (see below).
   
   A more formal description of the V3 goals can be found in the official
   [36]design document.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.2 Why should I use libstdc++?

   The recent completion of the ISO C++ standardization gave the C++
   community a powerful set of reuseable tools in the form of the C++
   Standard Library. However, all existing C++ implementations are (as
   the Draft Standard used to say) "incomplet and incorrekt," and many
   suffer from limitations of the compilers that use them.
   
   The GNU C/C++/FORTRAN/<pick-a-language> compiler (gcc, g++, etc) is
   widely considered to be one of the leading compilers in the world. Its
   development has recently been taken over by the [37]GCC team. All of
   the rapid development and near-legendary [38]portability that are the
   hallmarks of an open-source project are being applied to libstdc++.
   
   That means that all of the Standard classes and functions (such as
   string, vector<>, iostreams, and algorithms) will be freely available
   and fully compliant. Programmers will no longer need to "roll their
   own" nor be worried about platform-specific incompatabilities.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.3 Who's in charge of it?

   The libstdc++ project is contributed to by several developers all over
   the world, in the same way as GCC (EGCS) or Linux. Benjamin Kosnik,
   Gabriel Dos Reis, Nathan Myers, and Ulrich Drepper are the lead
   maintainers of the CVS archive.
   
   Development and discussion is held on the libstdc++ mailing list.
   Subscribing to the list, or searching the list archives, is open to
   everyone. You can read instructions for doing so on the [39]homepage.
   If you have questions, ideas, code, or are just curious, sign up!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.4 How do I get libstdc++?

   The ninth (and latest) snapshot of libstdc++-v3 is [40]available via
   ftp.
   
   The [41]homepage has instructions for retrieving the latest CVS
   sources, and for browsing the CVS sources over the web.
   
   The subset commonly known as the Standard Template Library (chapters
   23 through 25, mostly) is adapted from the SGI STL, which is also an
   ongoing work.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.5 When is libstdc++ going to be finished?

   Nathan Myers gave the best of all possible answers in [42]a recent
   Usenet article.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.6 How do I contribute to the effort?

   Here is [43]a page devoted to this topic. Subscribing to the mailing
   list (see above, or the homepage) is a very good idea if you have
   something to contribute, or if you have spare time and want to help.
   Contributions don't have to be in the form of source code; anybody who
   is willing to help write documentation, for example, or has found a
   bug in code that we all thought was working, is more than welcome!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.7 What happened to libg++? I need that!

   The most recent libg++ README states that libg++ is no longer being
   actively maintained. It should not be used for new projects, and is
   only being kicked along to support older code.
   
   The libg++ was designed and created when there was no Standard to
   provide guidance. Classes like linked lists are now provided for by
   list<T> and do not need to be created by genclass. (For that matter,
   templates exist now and are well-supported, whereas genclass (mostly)
   predates them.)
   
   There are other classes in libg++ that are not specified in the ISO
   Standard (e.g., statistical analysis). While there are a lot of really
   useful things that are used by a lot of people (e.g., statistics :-),
   the Standards Committee couldn't include everything, and so a lot of
   those "obvious" classes didn't get included.
   
   Since libstdc++ is an implementation of the Standard Library, we have
   no plans at this time to include non-Standard utilities in the
   implementation, however handy they are. (The extensions provided in
   the SGI STL aren't maintained by us and don't get a lot of our
   attention, because they don't require a lot of our time.) It is
   entirely plausable that the "useful stuff" from libg++ might be
   extracted into an updated utilities library, but nobody has stated
   such a project yet.
   
   (The [44]Boost site houses free C++ libraries that do varying things,
   and happened to be started by members of the Standards Committee.
   Certain "useful stuff" classes will probably migrate there.)
   
   For the bold and/or desperate, the [45]GCC FAQ describes where to find
   the last libg++ source.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1.8 What if I have more questions?

   If you have read the README and RELEASE-NOTES files, and your question
   remains unanswered, then just ask the mailing list. At present, you do
   not need to be subscribed to the list to send a message to it. More
   information is available on the homepage (including how to browse the
   list archives); to send to the list, use
   [46]libstdc++@sourceware.cygnus.com.
   
   If you have a question that you think should be included here, or if
   you have a question about a question/answer here, contact [47]Phil
   Edwards or [48]Gabriel Dos Reis.

                               2.0 Installation
                                       
2.1 How do I install libstdc++-v3?

   Complete instructions are not given here (this is a FAQ, not an
   installation document), but the tools required are few:
     * A release of libstdc++.
     * A recent release of GCC (version 2.95 works). Note that building
       GCC is much easier and more automated than building the GCC 2.[78]
       series was.
     * If you plan on hacking around with the makefiles, you will need
       the tools [49]autoconfand [50]automake.
     * GNU Make is the only make that supports these makefiles.
       
   The file [51]documentation.html provides a good overview of the steps
   necessary to build, install, and use the library. Instructions for
   configuring the library with new flags such as --enable-threads are
   there also.
   
   The top-level install.html and [52]RELEASE-NOTES files contain the
   exact build and installation instructions. You may wish to browse
   those files over CVSweb ahead of time to get a feel for what's
   required. RELEASE-NOTES is located in the ".../docs/17_intro/"
   directory of the distribution.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.2 Is this a drop-in replacement for the libstdc++ that's shipped with g++?

   Yes, as of 2.90.8, it is intended as such.
   
   The installation instructions cover this in more detail, but replacing
   the older library requires rebuilding some of the code that comes with
   g++. If you do not want to do that, then you'll be missing out on a
   lot of functionality, but it can still be done.
   
   In that case, you can use the same procedure that used to be required:
    1. Build GCC as usual.
    2. Build libstdc++-v3 as described in the installation document,
       under the section "without GCC sources." Be aware that you will
       lose the std:: namespace encapsulation.
    3. Build your code using -I and -L options so that GCC finds the
       libstdc++-v3 headers and library before the older headers in the
       GCC include tree.
       
   If you configured libstdc++-v3 to install under a directory called
   /lib3, for example, the command line would look something like
      g++ -Wall -I/lib3/include/g++-v3 -L/lib3/lib foo.cc -o foo


   More information (such as using SGI or GNU extensions, and setting the
   runtime library path) can be found in the RELEASE-NOTES.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.3 What is this CVS thing that you keep mentioning?

   The Concurrent Versions System is one of several revision control
   packages. It was selected for GNU projects because it's free and very
   high quality. The [53]CVS entry in the GNU software catalogue has a
   better description as well as a [54]link to the makers of CVS.
   
   The "anonymous client checkout" feature of CVS is similar to anonymous
   FTP in that it allows anyone to retrieve the latest libstdc++ sources.
   
   After the first of April, American users will have a "/pharmacy"
   command-line option...
     _________________________________________________________________
   
2.4 How do I know if it works?

   libstdc++-v3 comes with its own testsuite. You do not need to actually
   install the library ("gmake install") to run the testsuite.
   
   To run the testsuite on the library after building it, use "gmake
   check" while in your build directory. To run the testsuite on the
   library after building and installing it, use "gmake check-install"
   instead.
   
   The testsuite subdirectory in your build directory will then contain
   three files of the form YYYYMMDD-mkcheck*.txt. One of them
   (-mkcheck.txt itself) contains the results of the tests; this can be
   mailed to the list. The other files (-mkchecklog.txt and
   -mkcheckfiles.txt) contain messages from the compiler while building
   the test programs, and a list of the tests to be run, respectively.
   
   If you are using the libgcc.a-rebuilding method to enable std:: you
   might find that the testsuite starts dying with nasty linker errors.
   This is symptomatic of the rebuilt libgcc.a not being installed; the
   previous one is still in use.
   
   If you find bugs in the testsuite programs themselves, or if you think
   of a new test program that should be added to the suite, please write
   up your idea and send it to the list!
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                         3.0 Platform-Specific Issues
                                       
3.1 Can libstdc++-v3 be used with <my favorite compiler>?

   Probably not. Yet.
   
   Because GCC advances so rapidly, development and testing of libstdc++
   is being done almost entirely under that compiler. If you are curious
   about whether other, lesser compilers (*grin*) support libstdc++, you
   are more than welcome to try. Configuring and building the library
   (see above) will still require certain tools, however. Also keep in
   mind that building libstdc++ does not imply that your compiler will be
   able to use all of the features found in the C++ Standard Library.
   
   Since the goal of ISO Standardization is for all C++ implementations
   to be able to share code, the final libstdc++ should, in theory, be
   useable under any ISO-compliant compiler. It will still be targeted
   and optimized for GCC/g++, however.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
3.2 Building under Cygwin hangs/explodes!?

   Sometimes, yes. You're probably in the middle of generating the
   numeric_limits specializations when it hangs, right? Thought so...
   
   The <limits> header and its associated library code are
   platform-specific. These files get generated from scratch during
   installation, and it is this generator that is hanging. More
   specifically, the only sure way to determine what the
   numeric_limits<T>::traps boolean should be is to actually divide by
   zero and see if it is trapped or not.
   
   Under NT, this will occasionally just hang. On those occasions when
   the test does not hang, the zero-division is in fact trapped. That
   doesn't prevent hanging elsewhere.
   
   You have two options. You can wait until the signal-handling in Cygwin
   is reworked and released; this is planned to take "a few weeks" and
   will result in a fix sometime in late December or early January. Or
   you can get a prebuilt set of bits/std_limits.h and
   src/limitsMEMBERS.cc files from Mumit Khan's [55]Cygwin-related
   website.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                          4.0 Known Bugs and Non-Bugs
                                       
   Note that this section can get rapdily outdated -- such is the nature
   of an open-source project. For the latest information, join the
   mailing list or look through recent archives. The RELEASE- NOTES and
   BUGS files are generally kept up-to-date.
   
4.1 What works already?

   This is a verbatim clip from the "Status" section of the RELEASE-NOTES
   for the latest snapshot.
New:
---
- MT safe string. Supported CPUs are alpha, powerpc, x86, sparc32 and sparc64.
- Configure support for --enable-threads=posix, as well as initial IO
  locking implementation.
- Support for native building on Solaris 2.5.1, Solaris 2.6, Solaris
  2.7, cygwin, [alpha, powerpc, x86]-linux, and preliminary support for
  Irix and Aix4.2, Aix 4.3 hosts.
- --enable-namespaces is on by default.
- Configure and Makefile support for "drop-in" replacement to
  libstdc++-v2 completed. It is now possible to bootstrap g++, and
  have g++ find libstdc++-v3 headers and libraries by default.
- Synched with CVS egcs libio.
- Cygwin native compiling supported.
- Cross compiling and embedded targets (newlib) with multilibs support added.
- SGI's strstream implementation has been added.
- Copyright on all sources assigned to the FSF.
- Configure, build and install documentation has been added.
- Support to enable long long has been added.
- More valarray improvements.
- Extractors and inserters for std::complex have been added.
- Extractors and inserters for void* have been fixed.
- autoconf macros are now in _GLIBCPP_ namespace.
- group checking for num_get implemented.
- Many, many bug fixes.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.2 Bugs in gcc/g++ (not libstdc++-v3)

   This is by no means meant to be complete nor exhaustive, but mentions
   some problems that users may encounter when building or using
   libstdc++. If you are experiencing one of these problems, you can find
   more information on the libstdc++ and the GCC mailing lists.
     * When using associative containers (like map), and compiling with
       -O3 (or -finline-functions) and -Winline, I get a zillion errors
       like:
   .../include/g++/stl_tree.h: In function `int __black_count(struct __rb_tree_
node_base *, struct __rb_tree_node_base *)':
   .../include/g++/stl_tree.h:1045: warning: can't inline call to `int __black_
count(struct __rb_tree_node_base *, struct __rb_tree_node_base *)'
   .../include/g++/stl_tree.h:1053: warning: called from here

       This has been discussed a number of times; the problem is that
       __black_count is marked inline but is also a recursive function.
       As of 12 July 1999, it has been rewritten into an optimized
       non-recursive form, so fresh checkouts/releases should no longer
       see this warning. (The compiler can usually figure out how to make
       that transformation on its own.)
     * The reason that EGCS 1.1.2 cannot be used to build the library is
       that lookups do not work properly, and so the compiler will ICE
       when building the locale-related source files. This has been fixed
       in GCC 2.95.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.3 Bugs in the C++ language/lib specification

   Yes, unfortunately, there are some. In a [56]message to the list,
   Nathan Myers announced that he has started a list of problems in the
   ISO C++ Standard itself, especially with regard to the chapters that
   concern the library. The list itself is [57]posted on his website.
   Developers who are having problems interpreting the Standard may wish
   to consult his notes.
   
   For those people who are not part of the ISO Library Group (i.e.,
   nearly all of us needing to read this page in the first place :-), a
   public list of the library defects is occasionally published [58]here.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.4 Things in libstdc++ that look like bugs

   There are things which are not bugs in the compiler (4.2) nor the
   language specification (4.3), but aren't really bugs in libstdc++,
   either. Really!
   
   The biggest of these is the quadzillions of warnings about the library
   headers emitted when -Weffc++ is used. Making libstdc++
   "-Weffc++-clean" is not a goal of the project, for a few reasons.
   Mainly, that option tries to enforce object-oriented programming,
   while the Standard Library isn't necessarily trying to be OO. There
   are multiple solutions under discussion.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
4.5 Aw, that's easy to fix!

   If you have found a bug in the library and you think you have a
   working fix, then send it in! The main GCC site has a page on
   [59]submitting patches that covers the procedure, but for libstdc++
   you should of course send the patch to our mailing list, not the GCC
   mailing list. The libstdc++ [60]contributors' page also talks about
   how to submit patches.
   
   In addition to the description, the patch, and the ChangeLog entry, it
   is a Good Thing if you can additionally create a small test program to
   test for the presence of the bug that your patch fixes. Bugs have a
   way of being reintroduced; if an old bug creeps back in, it will be
   caught immediately by the [61]testsuite -- but only if such a test
   exists.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
                               5.0 Miscellaneous
                                       
5.1 string::iterator is not char*; vector<T>::iterator is not T*

   If you have code that depends on container<T> iterators being
   implemented as pointer-to-T, your code is broken.
   
   While there are arguments for iterators to be implemented in that
   manner, A) they aren't very good ones in the long term, and B) they
   were never guaranteed by the Standard anyway. The type-safety achieved
   by making iterators a real class rather than a typedef for T*
   outweighs nearly all opposing arguments.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.2 What's next after libstdc++-v3?

   Hopefully, not much. The goal of libstdc++-v3 is to produce a
   fully-compliant, fully-portable Standard Library. After that, we're
   mostly done: there won't be any more compliance work to do.
   
   The ISO Committee will meet periodically to review Defect Reports in
   the C++ Standard. Undoubtably some of these will result in changes to
   the Standard, which will be reflected in patches to libstdc++. Some of
   that is already happening, see 4.2.
   
   The current libstdc++ contains extensions to the Library which must be
   explicitly requested by client code (for example, the hash tables from
   SGI). Other extensions may be added to libstdc++-v3 if they seem to be
   "standard" enough. (For example, the "long long" type from C99.)
   Bugfixes and rewrites (to improve or fix thread safety, for instance)
   will of course be a continuing task.
   
   [62]This question about the next libstdc++ prompted some brief but
   interesting [63]speculation.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.3 What about the STL from SGI?

   The [64]STL from SGI is merged into libstdc++-v3 with changes as
   necessary. Currently release 3.2 is being used. Changes in the STL
   usually produce some weird bugs and lots of changes in the rest of the
   libstd++ source as we scramble to keep up. :-)
   
   In particular, string is not from SGI and makes no use of their "rope"
   class (which is included as an optional extension), nor is valarray
   and some others. Classes like vector<> are, however.
   
   The FAQ for SGI's STL (one jump off of their main page) is recommended
   reading.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.4 Extensions and Backward Compatibility

   Although you can specify -I options to make the preprocessor search
   the g++-v3/ext and /backward directories, it is better to refer to
   files there by their path, as in:
       #include <ext/hash_map>

     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.5 Compiling with "-fnew-abi"

   The library mostly works if you compile it (and programs you link with
   it) using "-fnew-abi -fno-honor-std" on a vanilla GCC compiler.
   However, some features, such as RTTI and error handlers, might not
   link properly with a vanilla libgcc built in GCC under the old ABI. If
   you rebuild libgcc using the "-f" flags above, you can get both
   complete language support and full benefits of -fnew-abi -- short
   mangled symbol names, far more efficient exception handling, and empty
   base optimization, to name a few. (Note that the new ABI may change
   from one GCC snapshot to the next, so you would have to rebuild all
   your libraries each time you get a new compiler snapshot.)
   
   Towards the end of July 1999, this subject was brought up again on the
   mailing list under a different name. The related [65]thread (by the
   name HOWTO-honor-std) is very instructive. More info is at the end of
   RELEASE-NOTES.
   
   This functionality is now automated and turned on by default.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.6 Is libstdc++-v3 thread-safe?

   Quick answer: no, as of 2.90.8 (ninth snapshot), the library is not
   appropriate for multithreaded access. The string class is MT-safe.
   
   This is assuming that your idea of "multithreaded" is the same as
   ours... The general question of multithreading and libstdc++-v3 is
   addressed in the chapter-specific advice for [66]Library Introduction.
   Threadsafe containers are covered in more detail in [67]the Received
   Wisdom section on containers.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
5.7 How do I get a copy of the ISO C++ Standard?

   Copies of the full ISO 14882 standard are available on line via the
   ISO mirror site for committee members. Non-members, or those who have
   not paid for the privilege of sitting on the committee and sustained
   their two-meeting commitment for voting rights, may get a copy of the
   standard from their respective national standards organization. In the
