<H2 CLASS="centered"><TT>--enable-libgcc-rebuild</TT></H2>

<P>If you build libstdc++ using certain flags (e.g., -fnew-abi), then
   programs that use some of the new C++ language features (like namespace
   std and RTTI) will only link if the compiler's libgcc is built using
   the same flags.  Other extralinguistic flags (like -fsquangle to change
   the name mangling algorithm) will have the same effect.
</P>

<P>Since the compiler and this library are currently separate projects,
   you would normally have to do this yourself.  Passing
   --enable-libgcc-rebuild to libstdc++'s configure script means that when
   you type 'make' next, after libstdc++ is built, then libgcc will also
   be rebuilt.  If you've given other --enable/--with switches to libstdc++
   that would require a core library rebuild, then those compiler options
   will be automatically used when compiling libgcc, such that both
   libraries will always be built with the same options.
</P>

<P>Of course, since they are currently separate projects, the libstdc++
   scripts have no idea where you've built your GCC, so you must tell it.
   The argument to this enable switch is the path to the GCC build
   directory.  The GCC configuration documentation refers to this directory
   as <EM>objdir</EM>; here it will be called <EM>GCCobjdir</EM>.
</P>

<P>This is a kludge, and will go away eventually.  (In a sense, it has
   already gone away, as the library sources have been merged into the
   compiler sources.)
</P>

<HR>

<H3>If you kept your <EM>GCCobjdir</EM></H3>
<P>Easy as pi, er, pie.  Just pass the pathname to the --enable switch
   (absolute pathnames are best), and build libstdc++ as you normally
   would.  When it is finished, 'make' will go over to <EM>GCCobjdir</EM>
   and build a new libgcc.a for you.
</P>
<P>Once that's done, skip down to &quot;Installing the new libgcc.a.&quot;
</P>


<H3>If you deleted your <EM>GCCobjdir</EM>, or never had one</H3>
<P>Aaargggghhh, you had to make things difficult.  Okay, note for future
   reference:  if you plan on experimenting with weird features, you'll want
   to keep your build directories around.  If you're having to re-unpack
   the GCC source for this step, the same thing applies.
</P>
<P>We don't put a whole lot of effort into supporting this, so you might
   just have to go the long way 'round if you run into difficulties.
</P>
<P>You'll have to trick the configure script into believing that libgcc.a
   has been previously built.  You'll also have to build the libraries that
   libgcc.a needs.  The steps are these:
   <OL>
   <LI>Unpack the GCC sources.  Call this directory <EM>GCCsrcdir</EM>.
   <LI>&quot;<TT>mkdir <EM>GCCobjdir</EM> && cd <EM>GCCobjdir</EM> &&
       <EM>GCCsrcdir</EM>/configure --whatever</TT>&quot;
       <BR>Configure GCC like you normally would.  See
          <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html">the GCC
          configuration instructions</A> for all the possible values
          of <TT>--whatever</TT>.
   <LI>&quot;<TT>cd libiberty && make</TT>&quot;
   <LI>&quot;<TT>cd ../gcc; touch libgcc2.ready</TT>&quot;
   </OL>
   Now go back to &quot;If you kept your GCCobjdir&quot; and proceed from there.
</P>


<H3>Installing the new libgcc.a</H3>
<P>The reckless method is
   <PRE>
   cd GCCobjdir/gcc
   make install-libgcc</PRE>
   This will copy in the new libgcc.a on top of the old one.
</P>
<P>The wiser method is to keep the old one around under a different name,
   and install the new one under another different name, and then make
   libgcc.a be a hard or soft link to one of the two real libraries.  Or
   copy one of them by a new name into a directory searched by the linker,
   and use -l (dash ell) to pick it up before finding the default
   <EM>other</EM> library.
</P>

<HR>

<P>If you're <B>really</B> interested in using a particular flag (say,
   -fhonor-std) under <B>all</B> conditions, then you can edit
   <EM>GCCsrcdir</EM>/gcc/cp/decl2.c and change the initialization of the
   appropriate <TT>flag_</TT> variable to 1.  This will turn that flag
   on by default, which means that libgcc.a, libstdc++.a, libstdc++.so,
   and everything else you ever do will be built with that feature
   unless you specifically turn it <EM>off</EM>.
</P>
