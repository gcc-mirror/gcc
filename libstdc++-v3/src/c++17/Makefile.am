# Libtool notes

# 1) In general, libtool expects an argument such as `--tag=CXX' when
# using the C++ compiler, because that will enable the settings
# detected when C++ support was being configured.  However, when no
# such flag is given in the command line, libtool attempts to figure
# it out by matching the compiler name in each configuration section
# against a prefix of the command line.  The problem is that, if the
# compiler name and its initial flags stored in the libtool
# configuration file don't match those in the command line, libtool
# can't decide which configuration to use, and it gives up.  The
# correct solution is to add `--tag CXX' to LTCXXCOMPILE and maybe
# CXXLINK, just after $(LIBTOOL), so that libtool doesn't have to
# attempt to infer which configuration to use.
#
# The second tag argument, `--tag disable-shared` means that libtool
# only compiles each source once, for static objects. In actuality,
# glibcxx_lt_pic_flag and glibcxx_compiler_shared_flag are added to
# the libtool command that is used create the object, which is
# suitable for shared libraries.  The `--tag disable-shared` must be
# placed after --tag CXX lest things CXX undo the affect of
# disable-shared.

# 2) Need to explicitly set LTCXXCOMPILE so that EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS is
# last. (That way, things like -O2 passed down from the toplevel can
# be overridden by --enable-debug.)

# 3) We'd have a problem when building the shared libstdc++ object if
# the rules automake generates would be used.  We cannot allow g++ to
# be used since this would add -lstdc++ to the link line which of
# course is problematic at this point.  So, we get the top-level
# directory to configure libstdc++-v3 to use gcc as the C++
# compilation driver.
